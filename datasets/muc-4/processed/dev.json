(begin recording) (unidentified reporter) what important subjects were discussed in the council of ministers meeting today?    (garcia) the main subject was the decision to call a special congressional session on 22 and 23 december to consider the serious situation created by the u.s. invasion in panama.  the second important subject was the decision to denounce the tiar, a military organization that groups all the latin american countries and the united states and which, on several occasions, has proved to be absolutely ineffective and partial.    the malvinas islands situation is a good example.  according to the tiar, the united states should have supported argentina, but it did exactly the contrary, supporting the united kingdom.    now, in this case with panama, the tiar has not served any purpose. rather, it has served to mask the u.s. invasion of panama.  therefore, since we consider the tiar to be ineffective and senseless, we, as a republic, must denounce it.  we must withdraw our signature from the tiar.  this must be done through congress, and that is why we have called a special session.    (reporter) several sectors have described the decision to withdraw the peruvian ambassador to the united states as a hasty decision. what do you think of that?    (garcia) i think that those must be sectors committed to the invasion.  they must support a rightist concept by which the united states has the hegemonic right to safeguard our destiny and to decide who can govern us and who cannot.    as peruvians and latin americans, we feel that the aggressive and bloody action by u.s. troops to occupy a small country is a violation. there are currently nearly 30,000 u.s. soldiers in panamanian territory.  they have killed many people and they want to impose a new government.  thus, as long as those troops remain there, as long as this violation to latin america is maintained, our ambassador will not stay in that country.  this does not imply a break in relations; it represents a clear gesture of condemnation and dislike.    as long as a u.s. soldier violates the republic of panama, we will keep our ambassador here.  as long as the united states does not withdraw their troops and panama remains occupied, the panamanian and peruvian flags will remain together.    (reporter) don't you think that this attitude could harm certain relations with the united states; that is, couldn't it jeopardize the imf loan?    (garcia) not at all.  these are two absolutely different things. the negotiations with the imf are one thing; the international political attitude of a government that abuses its economic and military power with other countries is something else.    besides, we should mention something very important.  as for panamanian-u.s. relations, the americans have been the main accomplices in depriving panama of democracy.  when elections took place in 1984, when arnulfo arias should have won, the united states decided that it was not convenient that arias should win, so a large fraud -- as it was declared at the time -- was carried out to place nicolas ardito barletta in power.  the first ones to recognize ardito were the americans.  ardito was placed in the presidency by noriega.    in 1985 noriega removed ardito and put eric arturo del valle in his place.  the americans immediately recognized del valle as president. therefore, the united states has been noriega's accomplice in depriving panama of democracy.  we denounced this.  noriega is a creation of the united states.  it has repeatedly been said that noriega worked with the united states and with the u.s.  central intelligence agency, where president bush was once chief.    therefore, now that the maid is answering back, making claims to the panama canal and wanting to become independent from the united states, the united states suddenly discovers that she is a drug trafficker and that she does not serve its interests, so they send 30,000 u.s. soldiers to panama.  this is an abuse.  it is a violation of the sovereignty of another state.    no honorable latin american country should tolerate this invasion without actively and openly condemning it.  one way to condemn it and express disapproval of it is to say that as long as the troops invading latin america remain, we do not need to maintain our ambassador there.

(begin recording) (d'aubuisson) it was not the institution (armed forces) that was involved in the problem.  regrettably some of its members did it and now the entire armed forces are under pressure for political reasons.  however, we must realize that it is thanks to the armed forces that we have this democratic process, with a hope that our country develops and recovers.  it is very unfair that some people pass judgment or criticize without really knowing how hard it has been on all the officers, noncommissioned officers, and troops who have had to put up with these attacks in addition to the intense work they have had for the past few months. (end recording)    d'aubuisson said that once the murder of the six jesuits has been cleared up, u.s. authorities have no reason to question the continuation of u.s. economic assistance to the country.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) the jesuits' case was a determining factor.  but now that the case has been fully solved with the help of the fbi, scotland yard, and investigators from other countries, this is no longer a problem, although previously it was serious.  i do not believe there can be any doubt now about receiving the aid, especially after the tremendous offensive launched by the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front).  for argument's sake, if the situation did arise (whereby aid was suspended), this would only favor the fmln.  i know the fmln has a whole range of support groups that handle disinformation and make it appear as if things here were disastrous. for example, information abroad is that the air force leveled all the neighborhoods.  we salvadorans know that the air force was excessively cautious and did an excellent job repelling this attack with a minimum of civilians wounded.  for that matter, if we are going to compare things, u.s. military operations in panama were more clumsy -- there they set a whole neighborhood on fire. (end recording)    the arena leader also denied that there were differences between president cristiani and himself.  according to international press agencies, the decision of the salvadoran president to prosecute the military men involved in the jesuits' murder caused division within the party.  d'aubuisson denied this was true.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) not in the least.  there have never been any differences with president cristiani.  on the contrary, we are very close and grateful for the great effort, work, and the magnificent job president cristiani is doing.  this is reason for pride not only among friends of president cristiani but for the party and friends of the salvadoran government. (end recording)    in commenting on the dialogue with the fmln, d'aubuisson supported president critiani's initiative of engaging the assistance of the un secretary general.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) i do not think he has the time to act as mediator; however, he could act as a guarantor, receiving results of these talks and ensuring compliance with the commitments made.

{"docid": "TST1-MUC3-0030", "doctext": "as a latin american president, i feel a little bit uncomfortable over the statement that the north americans are victims of the drugs produced in latin america and that colombia, peru, and bolivia are to blame for producing the drugs; let's call those countries to talk with them. that seems to me a very ethnocentric vision; it looks at this matter from only one side.  our peasants are poor people who produce whatever is most profitable, and coca cultivation happens to be most profitable for them.  this is so, speaking coldly, honestly, and sincerely.  as president of peru i have to point out that my people, the huallage region peasants, cannot be considered as criminals or as people who must be jailed for producing coca leaves.    we have exchanged these views with president barco, and we reached these conclusions.  we must also note that this matter has been handled with a great deal of publicity. after the death of carlos galan, a great colombian leader, the colombian government launched an offensive intended to find out whether the drug trafficking bands were responsible for his assassination, and the u.s. government then extended some assistance.  this assistance has been present to the world as though the united states had sent an enormous quantity of aircraft, hundreds of helicopters, and thousands of millions of dollars to colombia.  as i was able to see in bogota, only helicopters, some of which had been purchased earlier by the colombian government, were sent.  i was also informed that some of those helicopters had been used previously in peru.    i have said that, if there is that much conviction, i support president bush for defending u.s. society.  if he has that much conviction, it is hard to believe that less than one thousandth of what is spent in arms and military expenditures should be allocated to replace coca plantations and to improve the general situation in latin america.  we have talked with president barco, and i will talk with president paz zamora to see how we can exchange opinions.  then, as president bush said, a meeting of presidents will be welcome.  but the meeting should also be attended by europe, which has a fundamental interest in the future.    (correspondent) would the idea be to hold a meeting in the near future of peru, colombia, and bolivia with president bush and a representative of the eec?    (garcia) yes, because drug trafficking is a growing problem. cartels have sprouted in colombia -- monopolies that try to elect deputies and senators to influence the government.  those monopolies might extend their operations to our countries if we do not stop this growing problem. the situation can become worse in bolivia, where it was said that the drug traffickers had an influence on a dictatorial military regime.  it is not just a matter of protecting the morality of humanity; it is not just a matter of defending the united states, which has a primary role in world leadership; it is essentially a matter of defending our democracy -- the legitimacy and cleanliness of our social life.  i hope that we can have a meeting of the three presidents first, so that we can let the u.s.  president know our views on the overall problem.    (correspondent) will you propose that meeting, mr president?    (garcia) i don't want to assume a leading role.  the idea emerged in a conversation with president barco, and i will talk later with president paz zamora.    (correspondent) a meeting between you and president bush late this month has been mentioned.  is this true, mr president?    (garcia) no, i believe that has been mere speculation in the press. for the time being i have discarded the idea of making another trip abroad.  i do not see the concrete possibility of meeting with president bush, although i hope we can meet sometime before 28 july 1990.    (correspondent) changing the subject, mr president -- much has been said in recent days about the possible or probable expulsion of peru from the imf.  what is the truth about this, and what would expulsion mean?    (garcia) well, first, it is politically impossible for peru to be expelled from the imf.  second, there is misinformation and alarmism regarding the matter.  what is the imf?  it is some sort of creditor bank created in 1946 that lends money to countries with balance-of-payments problems; that is, with problems with their foreign reserves levels.  when a country has no reserves or only $100 million in reserves, it can apply for a credit from the imf to pay for imports or overdue debts.  this is the imf, an organization created to facilitate the flow of international financial resources.  an imf credit is dependent on signing a letter of intent or an adjustment program.  adjustment means reducing the country's internal consumption so as to spare the country's reserves in order to meet debt obligations.

(begin recording) (reporter) good morning, colonel.    (ochoa) good morning. thanks, raul.  these gentlemen seem to be speaking in the name of the entire armed forces.  i know well what was discussed in the meeting. someone even said that the bright idea of discharging me was considered.  they failed to take into account, however, that i am a deputy and that, as a deputy and a citizen, i am entitled to express what i feel, just as i have done.  i, who owe everything to the armed forces, who fought beside the soldiers as monterrosa, carlitos, and very few others did, never got rich when in the armed forces, as some of the commanders did, although not all of them, of course.  this undoubtedly has irritated them.    i have simply expressed my viewpoint as a soldier concerned about the armed forces' situation.  i never mentioned any names.  i simply demanded justice because, even according to military theory, i cannot conceive that such an important decision could have been made by a single person.  i still think this is a plot by some members of the institution, not by the armed forces as such.  i only have respect and love for the armed forces.  i am concerned over the delicate situation to which the institution could be led because of the actions of some nefarious members.  i have deep respect for the officers in the field, who fight every day.  of course, i must criticize those who have profited from the institution and who today have raised the roof, as if i were the one to blame and as if i were undermining the institutionality of the state.  quite the opposite is true.  my criticism is positive and intends to encourage a deeper investigation and exhaust all resources in this direction.  i would like them to stop making ridiculous demands and to stop seeking a confrontation. it is known that what i am demanding is what is being felt and said. i am not accusing anyone in particular.  i am only demanding justice. commanders' meetings should not be held to make such a statement. they should have instead shown their concern over the armed forces' situation.  i would have been very interested in seeing them take the stand to continue the investigation to the last consequences.  as the military man i am, i only assessed the situation.  i never mentioned any names, but insisted that a deeper inquiry should be made to carry out justice, because otherwise it is the institution that will suffer.

(ochoa) i think so. there has been an attempt to blame me, as if i could influence the decision-making of the u.s. congress.  a reduction in military aid to el salvador has been under consideration for months because the expected results have not been obtained.  i think it is ridiculous and childish to say that the aid will be cut as the result of my remarks.  the truth is that all crimes with which some armed forces' members have jeopardized the institution should be punished. my understanding is that solidarity should exist in the context of operations and the fulfillment of the armed forces' constitutional mission.  however, those who harm the institution should not be protected.    i think some are trying to take advantage of the situation, as if to say: col ochoa has endangered the armed forces.  what has endangered the institution is the murder of the jesuits and the san sebastian people.  i canot agree with the perpetration of outrages. one thing is to fight fairly with the enemy.  there are dead in every war.  i said this very clearly when i was 4th infantry brigade commander in cabanas.  i agreed with the penetration into the population to help them.  i feel satisfied over my passage through the armed forces as a commander, because i identified myself both with my men and the civilian population.  at no time did i take advantage of the institution to acquire illegal riches.  to point these things out is not to attack the armed forces.  quite the contrary, it is because i love it that i have criticized the negative members.  the armed forces can thus be spared greater damage by the poor actions of some of its members.

{"docid": "TST2-MUC4-0006", "doctext": "dear radio audience: first of all, i want to thank you for allowing me to talk to you tonight about a very important issue for the future of our country.  many times you have heard us mention the word solidarity.  we have always used it as a word that means to think about those who suffer the most, those who have less.  indeed, those are the people we must help, even with our own sacrifice, and many times with a huge sacrifice by all of us.  if love is the bond that unites family members, solidarity should be the great pillar, the cement that unites salvadoran society, so that, united, we may fulfill our desire for peace, tranquility, happiness, and well-being.    however, tonight allow me to give you two examples of what we consider should be the use of the word solidarity and what this word means in matters that are completely different from one another.  a few weeks ago the government was forced, due to an increase in oil prices, to raise the price of oil byproducts such as gasoline, diesel, and all fuels.  in the past, the government subsidized gasoline. perhaps the government did this to make people believe this would have nothing but positive effects.  however, let us analyze for a while the issue of increases in the price of fuel.  when a government has no money for subsidizing, that means the cost of living will go up. there is no doubt that prices will rise when a government spends more than what it has.  however, let us see how this aspect, or rather the principle of solidarity, applies to the increase in fuel prices, especially the price of gasoline.    ten percent of all families in our country own a vehicle.  in general, that 10 percent are those who have the most; in other words, those who have the possibility of buying a car, a vehicle.  if we subsidized gasoline, what we would be doing is taking money out of a government that, for the time being, does not have such funds available.  in order to get such funds, the government would have to impose new taxes which would affect all salvadorans.  therefore, let us think whether or not it is fair that 90 percent of all salvadoran families, who own no vehicles, must pay some kind of tax in order to benefit the other 10 percent who have the resources that allow them to buy a vehicle.    we do not want to appear as demagogic or populist with this example.  what we want to say is that those of us who own a vehicle, who are part of the 10 percent lucky enough to have something and thus can buy a vehicle, must be in solidarity with that 90 percent who have little and many times nothing.  they have no vehicles, and therefore have no reason to suffer so the gasoline we buy becomes cheaper. moreover, to some extent the current price of gasoline makes it possible for the diesel supplied to urban and interurban bus companies to be bought at a price that will allow bus owners to maintain the current bus fares.  this is solidarity, and even more than that. those of us who have something, who own a vehicle, pay something -- through the price of the gasoline we consume -- so that those who own nothing and must use the public transportation buses can do so with no price increase.    the same should be the case for the cost of liquid gas and propane gas, so that the prices of food cooked with gas in the marketplaces are not increased.  this is an example of how those of us who have something can show our solidarity with those who have little or nothing at all.    i would now like to talk about an example of an even deeper kind of solidarity.  i want to talk about peace.  salvadoran brothers, this is the time when we must show our solidarity with those mothers who have lost their sons.  we must show our solidarity with the innocent children who could kick a mine and end up without an arm or a leg.  we must show our solidarity with those who, because of violence, cannot find a job.  that is why this is the time for all of us to make an effort to achieve peace.    last thursday i told you i felt more optimistic after meeting with the political parties and listening to their decision to accept the challenge to work for peace.  they are determined to reach a consensus to fulfill the aspirations of all salvadorans.  we are beginning to sense what the near future of el salvador could be.  we are feeling happy and optimistic.  however, i repeat, this is the time when we should all contribute to peace.    anything that may lead to violence, whether it is street disturbances or bombs, should not be permitted, because it is no longer conceivable for mothers, children, and families to continue to suffer in our country.  the time has come to show our solidarity, to search, not only through words but also through our examples and actions, for the peace that our country and salvadorans deserve.    therefore, our solidarity should be the fundamental tool for our country's reconstruction.  it should be the fundamental tool for the physical and spiritual reconstruction of all salvadorans.  we want all salvadorans, without exception, to support the peace efforts, so that those who suffer so very much from violence will no longer suffer.    this is a fundamental step forward for the freedom and democracy of the salvadoran people.  salvadoran brothers, let us show our solidarity in this crucial time in our history, because we have always known that when all salvadorans act positively like brothers, we can come out ahead.  this is all for tonight.  thank you all very much and may god bless you.", "templates": []}

(moderator) raul monge, cadena radio centro.    (reporter) mr. president, how do you view the guerrillas' morale at this moment?
