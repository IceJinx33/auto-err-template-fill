(reporter) (words indistinct) commander, when do you expect the fmln to join the process?    (handal) look, deadlines are not the most important thing right now. what is important now is complying with the agreements to reach political agreements.  that is the main aspect of the geneva agreement.  it is possible that some deadlines will not be met. if deadlines are set and the time for implementing them expires, then this is tantamount to wasting time.  this then leads to steps being demanded that in reality depend on the political agreements that are reached and not the deadlines for reaching them.    therefore, according to the agenda and the timetable agreed to here in caracas, the accent is on the political agreements.  those agreements have to do with changes within the armed forces. everything related to the armed forces must be changed.  every factor concerning the armed forces must be reviewed from a certain point or perspective.  changes are necessary; changes must be made and those changes must be significant. these changes must completely transform the armed forces, beginning with its role and influence in determining the country's policies and guidelines.    we have been presenting proposals in this regard for some time. the topic of democratization is closely linked to the topic of the armed forces, to its purging, its reduction, and in sum, its end.  we believe that the country will not always need the armed forces.  as with any institution or historical factor, it emerges, it is maintained for a certain time, and then it tends to disappear.    the country must have the opportunity to develop. it cannot continue along the same path because this would only represent expenses and a heavy burden for the country.    for several decades, the armed forces have meant absence of liberty, real security, and the impossibility of the civilian society to decide the country's path.  elections have been turned into a mere formality, where those who were not elected run the country.    the country is now going through a drama that has also shocked the international public, the murder of the jesuit priests.  everyone is awaiting the results of the investigations and hoping that those who were responsible for this crime will be punished.  we believe that the case of jesuit priests is really grave; it is a drama that reflects the drama of the salvadoran people's history in the current century.

    "doctext": "those accused of the assassination of six jesuits will have a \"fair trial\" and if found guilty, will be punished whether they are civilians, military, or influential people, supreme court president dr mauricio gutierrez castro said.    the technical investigation commission has determined that some military were reportedly involved in the assassination of the six jesuits and their two maids, which took place at daybreak on 16 november, as reported by president alfredo cristiani on 7 january.    \"the local and international community can rest assured the salvadoran judiciary system will not hesitate to enforce the law upon the authors of this horrible crime,\" dr gutierrez pointed out.    gutierrez said he does not know how many people are involved or their military ranks, because the commission to investigate criminal actions is still conducting investigations and has not presented its report to the tribunal.    however, general prosecutor dr mauricio eduardo colorado maintained that the military suspects \"are regrouped and have been put in custody.\" however, he did not reveal the names or the military ranks of the suspects.    the prosecutor said that the scientific test conducted by the commission to investigate criminal actions and the specialized police working on this case have determined that the crime could have been perpetrated by armed forces members.    \"the attorney general office will proceed according to the law and against whoever turns out to be guilty, because it is the constitutional duty of the attorney general's office,\" colorado said.    asked about this issue, justice minister dr oscar alfredo santamaria, president of the commission to investigate criminal actions said: \"we understand that the most recent information on this case was announced by the president of the republic a few days ago.\"  he refused to make any further statements.    new uca (central american university) rector jesuit francisco estrada admitted president alfredo cristiani has taken \"a step forward\" by unmasking the suspects in this crime, \"because his ethic principles do not tolerate such atrocities.\"    estrada said he understands why cristiani, during his 7 january speech, did not give any names, \"because the investigations are still being conducted.\"  moreover, there must not only be one suspect, but rather several.\"    before meeting with the reporters, the uca rector met with officials from scotland yard.  a few days ago, he also met spanish, canadian, and u.s.  policemen who, at the government's request, are assisting the salvadoran commission in charge of clarifying this case.",

(begin recording) (gen vides) i told the political parties: if you want to give them advantages simply because you do not want your candidates to win, go ahead and do it.  they must decide whether they want to give away the advantages or not; but i think it would be unjust.  a death squad might say: we do not want peace and we will set off bombs until the others change their minds.    this is not the case right now.  we would be simply establishing a precedent.  that is the main danger.  if the constitution is changed at will today then it can be changed again tomorrow, and again until things are just as the rebels want them.

(words indistinct) two-faced cristiani administration, the fmln has decided to immediately contact the dialogue observers and the church, which is the mediator, to demand through them guarantees for opposition civic and labor groups and a review of the current conditions of the dialogue, negotiation process, and its prospects.  meanwhile, we believe that it is necessary to suspend our participation in the caracas meeting.

(begin recording) (unidentified military officer) the guerrillas used 60-mm mortars and rpg-18 rocket launchers.  the terrorists traveled in cars.  they destroyed several power poles on 29th street and machinegunned several transformers.  the attack came mainly from the south, where the cohache organization is located, and from the hondua church here.  they also attacked from the northeast, but most of the attackers came from the direction of the national university, firing from there at some (word indistinct) we have in the area.  we had removed the cordon around the university 4 or 5 days ago, and (words indistinct) fired from there.    the wounded include at least three civilians, one of whom is in serious condition and has already been taken by our troops to the military hospital; perhaps five traffic policemen, although this has not been confirmed; and a soldier of the belloso battalion.    no damage was caused here at the garrison.  only a few shells hit the garrison, and these were 60-mm mortar shells, which are not powerful enough to cause damage.  we found six (words indistinct).  as for the rpg's, we found only one (words indistinct) behind the antel (national administration for telecommunications) office (words indistinct).  we found six holes from m-79 shells, but they did not cause great damage.    one of our civilian employees came out slightly wounded from the (word indistinct).    (reporter) colonel, our country will have a new president in a few days. the fmln has called a new transportation stoppage beginning on 31 may and has now attacked the 1st brigade.  based on this evidence, do you feel the fmln will intensify its military actions in san salvador?      (military officer) of course, we are expecting this.  channel 12 has already reported that a transportation stoppage will begin on 31 may. therefore, we believe vigilance must be increased.  we expected this kind of attack.  we have always said we are prepared to repel any terrorist attack, and this was a typical terrorist attack.  from a military standpoint, i do not think the attack was very effective.  the guerrillas used mortars but mostly hurt civilians.

these are a truer and more accurate reflection of a firm's income.\"    cristiani says that the country's monetary policy must be aimed at increasing savings to promote domestic economic development.  he says that it is necessary to make interest received on savings accounts in the country's banks more attractive so that capital does not leave the country. regarding the country's currency, cristiani says:  \"we feel that currency value should be based on the availability of and demand for foreign exchange.  we do not think it is appropriate for the government to arbitrarily devalue and fix an exchange rate on the salvadoran colon. everything must be based on the foreign exchange our country may have to pay out for imports, because if we were to fix the rate at 10 (colones) to 1 (dollar), the central banks still would not have enough foreign exchange to cover all the importers' demands.\"    further details as available.",

    "doctext": "1. during the years of dictatorship, chilean foreign relations were divided into two processes. on the one hand, as the dictatorship became more and more isolated, it was increasingly condemned in international fora and repudiated by international public opinion. on the other hand, as more and more countries and organizations expressed their support for a free chile and generously granted their solidarity to our cause, our organizations and democratic parties became increasingly open to the world. thus, they expanded their horizons and contributed their experiences.    2. during this period, the party has substantially strengthened its international relations and enhanced its vision of the international situation. it has strengthened its ties with the latin american peoples' revolutionary and democratic cause, and it has fully immersed itself in the great debates of world socialism. to these debates we brought our views on a profoundly renewed leftist socialism committed to democracy, development, and social change.    3. our relations with the parties that make up the international socialist (si) and with the si organization itself have been enriched within this context. this strengthening of ties has been the result of two things. first, it is based on the position that in compliance with its principles the si has upheld regarding the chilean situation. in october 1973, a few days after the coup, si chairman willy brandt condemned the end of the chilean democracy and president allende's assassination at the un general assembly. at the time he also said this was a great step backward for those who aspired to achieve socialism through democratic means. since then, the si has been permanently mobilized in favor of chile by making the chilean cause and salvador allende the symbols of all international struggle for democracy and change. it is within this framework of interest and cooperation that the voice of chilean socialism has been heard and our ideas and proposals praised.    4. the second reason stems from the process of expansion and transformation experienced by the si in the past 2 decades. the overall process of change that took place in the world during this period -- the technological revolution, the growing interdependence among nations, expansion of communications, global nuclear and military proliferation, the emergence of developing countries as international counterparts, the worsening of extreme poverty and international inequalities, the progress of liberation struggles in the third world, international awareness of the values of democracy and human rights -- has also effected major changes in the ideas and positions of socialist parties around the world. in this framework, the si has expanded its outlook, has increasingly renewed its ideas and, above all, has accepted pluralism within its fold as well as a broad internal debate about the best way to promote the cause of an autonomous, democratic socialism. it should be noted that this debate acquired a democratic, antifascist content as a result of the major role played by socialist forces that have engaged in a long antifascist struggle.

(azcona) yes, but the nicaraguan government would also have to hold a dialogue with the nicaraguan resistance.    (reporter) i am the voz de nicaragua reporter.  what is your opinion of the agreement reached by the nicaraguan government with the political parties?    (azcona) well, i read the agreement last night and believe it to be a step forward.  incidentally, i read it twice last night and it is a very long document.  i am talking about the agreement with the parties that are truly opposition parties and not the one made with the other parties because these are not really opposition parties.    (reporter) what i wanted was your opinion on the demobilization of the contras from honduras.      (azcona) oh, you are talking about the small document that makes demands, demands, and more demands.  this document has no value.      (reporter) i mean the document signed with the 21 political parties...      (azcona, interrupting) that agreement is valuable but it does not mention the contra demobilization.  the document states that the nicaraguan government and the opposition parties agree that the esquipulas ii and costa del sol agreements should be abided by.  this is the document i read twice, and i believe it is quite serious and a step forward.    (reporter) what will you do to get the mercenaries to leave your country?    (azcona) first, i do not use derogatory terms.  they are nicaraguans who for different reasons disagree with the system in nicaragua.  these nicaraguans oppose the system, and for this and other reasons they have taken up arms against the system and have taken refuge in honduras.  i do not use the term mercenary.  i understand the nicaraguan government uses it and it is all right for them to do so, but i will not answer a question that uses a term that i believe is too derogatory.    (reporter) the demobilization plan has a very firm deadline and is to be completed within 90 days.  do you think...    (azcona, interrupting) no, no.  the 90-day deadline is included in an agreement signed by nicaraguan president ortega with three small nicaraguan leftist parties.  i do not believe this document is very important.  i do believe, however, that the agreement signed by the nicaraguan president and the opposition parties is important because it is based on the esquipulas ii and costa del sol agreements.  (words indistinct) terrorists in el salvador and contras are presently not active, so both situations -- contras and guerrillas -- are different.    (reporter) is it true that president cristiani is going to present a parallel program at the summit?    (azcona) (words indistinct) president cristiani comes to the summit as el salvador's legitimate president.  he has the right to present his points of view.  he has the right to contribute to the solution of problems in other countries as well as to ones in his own country.    (reporter) is there a possibility that a demobilization plan for the salvadoran guerrillas will be studied at this summit if president cristinai presents one?

(unidentified speaker) in fact, she and several das inspectors encountered some obstacles.  the attorney general's office was informed of these obstacles in order for it to make an investigation. i think that when she and the das personnel were preparing to go to puerto boyaca it was already known that these people would be present there for these proceedings and this was quite worrisome.    (corrales) as is known, judge gonzalez had to leave colombia because her life was threatened, and her father, former boyaca governor alvaro gonzalez santana, was subsequently murdered.    moreover, gen maza marquez said further that the fact that a payment is being offered for the capture of pablo escobar and gonzalo rodriguez gacha does not mean that other persons accused of being capos of the mafia are not being sought too.    (maza) we are taking action the length and breadth of the country. we are not showing any special considerations because we intend to act indiscriminately.  what we want is to fight a scourge that has greatly harmed all colombians.    (corrales) the das director said that if anyone being held in connection with the investigation of the killing of luis carlos galan is released, that does not mean that the investigations are not proceeding well.

(carrillo) general, approximately how many kilograms of explosives were in the car bomb?    (vargas) apparently it contained 60 kg of dynamite.  the dynamite was placed inside an old station wagon.  something must have happened to the people who were inside the vehicle at the time of the explosion -- the two people who were killed.  apparently the car bomb went off by accident.  it was not supposed to have gone off at that gas station.    (carrillo) have the people who were killed been identified?    (vargas) no, not yet.  we are trying to identify them now.    (carrillo) are there special security measures to counter this wave of terrorism?    (vargas) yes, of course.  we are carrying out a series of joint actions with the bogota police department and administrative department of security personnel to neutralize terrorist actions.  we are carrying out those actions in areas we consider critical or vulnerable and in other areas where we are counteracting and neutralizing terrorist actions, as i told you.    (carrillo) are there secret agents throughout the entire city?    (vargas) yes, we have uniformed and civilian personnel guarding the city right now.  we also have the support of the bogota police department, of dijin (directorate of judicial police and investigations), and of cijin (expansion unknown). they are cooperating with us.  they are guarding areas we consider critical or places that could be targets of terrorist attacks.    (carrillo) what other measures have you adopted along with the 13th infantry brigade and the bogota mayor?    (vargas) we have implemented a number of measures, such as increasing personnel on the streets and human and material resources. in addition, we have established chekckpoints in areas we consider critical and are carrying out a number of operational activities that will help us locate these criminals.",

(begin recording) (ponce) that shows there are, on the one hand, the proposals and what the terrorist leaders call their desire for peace, and, on the other hand, the real actions.  i think that the campaign the fmln has mounted nationwide was a bad step, because it does not show a real and sincere desire to seek peace in our country. (end recording)    colonel ponce added that the request for reducing the number of troops as stated in the guerrilla proposal is a political move.  he played down the latest rebel offer presented to the government in mexico.    (begin recording) (ponce) the proposal was aimed at improving the fmln's image abroad, which had deteriorated in one way or another. the proposal can be discussed; however, we in the armed forces are not the ones who will discuss it or who will decide whether it can or cannot be accepted.  it is a political decision, and the armed forces will accept the decision made by the government.  the military commanders are not the ones who must decide on the number of troops the institution should have.  this is a decision to be made by the legislative assembly, based on the requirements and threats the country may be facing. (end recording)    colonel ponce visited the positions of the army's belloso and atlacatl elite battalions in the towns of perquin in morazan department and la laguna in chalatenango department, near the honduran border, where fighting is taking place.  during this military tour, col ponce said that it has been demonstrated that there is no liberated or permanently occupied territory in el salvador.  however, the rebels claim they control that area of intense conflict where the war has left its indelible mark.",

    "doctext": "the most pressing demands of the chilean people have been brought up in the electoral campaign.  one of the most important achievements of this campaign has been the combining of the campaign with the just economic, political, and social demands that the democratic forces and the popular movement have been making for these 16 years of dictatorship.  these demands are related to the struggle against repression, the defense of human rights, the denunciation of crimes committed by the regime, and efforts to fight immunity and the suppression of the truth regarding torture, disappearances, and assassinations. these questions have once again come into the spotlight now that many rightist candidates are demagogically attempting to pose as defenders of human rights and since el mercurio has reported that the dictator is planning to convert the cni (national information center) into an agency of the army so that the main repressive body from all these years can be under his direct control.  jaime inzunza, leader of the united left and the communist party of chile, discusses these topics over a direct phone line from santiago, chile.    (begin recording) (announcer) how are the chilean people's demands connected to the ongoing electoral campaign?    (inzunza) they are connected through the democratization of the neighborhood boards during the electoral process; the strengthening of the unified actions of workers; the development of the committees for victory, which will also be committees for the defense of victory and committees for carrying on the democratic task; the development of confidence; the struggle for human rights, particularly concerning truth and justice and immunity for crimes; the increasing pressure by the immense majority of the population for the release of all political prisoners; and naturally for the dissolution of the cni. all of these questions are being brought up in the electoral campaign, and agreements have been reached within social organizations.  this was evidenced a week ago by the salvadora strike and by the current strike by coal miners.  this proves that the people have understood that the electoral campaign has to be an expression of their activities and a way to strengthen their social organizations for the future struggle. (end recording)    the preceding comments were made by communist party of chile leader jaime inzunza, who has been interviewed over the telephone on our program \"escucha chile.\"  another topic discussed by inzunza was the el mercurio report on the cni's transfer to the army.  the dissolution of the cni has become one of the most pressing demands of the immense majority of chileans.    (begin recording) (announcer) what is your opinion, jaime inzunza, on the dictator's intention to maintain the cni as it is and to keep it under his direct command?    (inzunza) i believe that this issue is particularly serious.  the intention is to maintain intact the main terrorist apparatus of the dictatorship, which has been responsible for the most flagrant violations of human rights throughout the years of its existence.  i understand that the dina (national intelligence directorate, replaced by cni) and the cni have been in fact a single apparatus and therefore the main organs of state terrorrism over the past 15 years.  if transferred to the army, the cni would continue to be under pinochet's orders.  under whose orders has it been all these years?  for whom has it been a direct agent all these years?  henceforth it will be under the control of the office of the commander in chief of the army. (end recording)    communist leader jaime inzunza added that pinochet's intent in transferring the cni to the army's direct command is to make the institution an accomplice in concealing people who have been responsible for crimes and human rights violations.    (begin recording) (inzunza) the idea is to involve the military institution in crimes for which the chilean people knows it was not responsible.  this is clear: what the democratic opposition forces want is to have the culprits behind those crimes and human rights violations prosecuted, not the military institution.  the transfer of the cni to the army is an attempt to make the men in uniform act as accomplices or accessories to those crimes.  loyalty is not at stake here; loyalty is defending values and principles, not some sort of criminal complicity that is not in line with the training of these men.  this seems to me to be particularly serious because this transfer implies maintaining the cni under the orders of the man responsible for the crimes committed all these years, the dictator himself. (end recording)    these have been answers given by jaime inzunza, united left and communist party of chile leader, to questions put to him over the phone by \"escucha chile,\" a radio moscow international program.",

    "doctext": "marco antonio guevara, of the \"up to date\" newscast.    (guevara) how do the five presidents conceive the demobilization of the fmln?  how does the salvadoran government conceive this happening?    (cristiani) i believe there have been substantial changes in this presidential meeting as compared to previous meetings.  to explain this better, marco antonio, we must say we will not fall into what has been used in the past, that is, the famous symmetry.  on this occasion, we have been very clear and categorical when we said that we were not willing to continue contributing sacrifices and other things from the salvadoran government in order to solve the nicaraguan problem exclusively.  we demanded uniformity, and any other country confronting the aggression of an irregular force -- any other country in central america -- also has the right to be treated in a uniform manner, as far as measures and criteria that may be adopted in the presidential meetings.    that is why today for the first time you are seeing how the measures adopted for the nicaraguan resistance -- that had been granted most of the attention up to now -- are also being adopted for the fmln.    we cannot allow a country to claim it is the only target of an aggression by an irregular armed force supported from abroad.  here in el salvador we now have greater evidence following this 11 november terrorist aggression that the fmln is a movement that can survive only with support from abroad, and that it obeys and exists because of international movements.    in the second place, it has demonstrated that it only has the capacity to generate terrorism, which has been mentioned in this document.  we cannot continue just talking about demobilization and pacification in nicaragua.  it is time to apply this to all irregular groups, be it the urng (guatemalan national revolutionary unity) in guatemala, or any other irregular armed group that may come up and may try to hinder the democratic process in the area.    we see this as something that has gone deep into the minds of all the central american presidents, and from now on, we will have greater uniformity in treating all of those irregular groups that operate in the region.    (moderator) rene hurtado of el mundo.    (hurtado) mr president, following the tela and costa del sol meetings, nicaragua has changed its stand.  in costa rica, president ortega was asked if he had sold out the fmln in exchange for the demobilization of the contras and other results of the summit in favor of nicaragua.  i would like to know your opinion about this, and also how you interpret the fact that president ortega has accepted some issues about the fmln that he did not allow in tela or costa del sol? on the other hand, will the demobilization of the fmln be the result of a dialogue or negotiations later on?    (cristiani) in the first place, i believe that daniel ortega was unable to pull any more tricks out of his hat, and he was facing a fact he could no longer hide: he is the one who is spreading armed revolutions in central america and trying to hamper democratic processes in the region.  once more he has been caught not honoring the commitments agreed on in tela, but rather violating these commitments.  on this occasion he has been left with no possible defense.    therefore, in our opinion, he has no option other than to accept the reality of what is happening in central america, or see himself totally isolated amid a peace plan that has international support. this situation would cause him many problems and headaches in political and diplomatic matters.",

    "doctext": "comrades: a new element that we must analyze and explain emerged at the conclusion of the central american presidents' emergency meeting. let us see first why the meeting took place.  the main reason is the very complicated predicament in which our offensive has placed cristiani and the high command.  as you will remember, the government has met with much international disrepute and isolation because of the brutal assassination of jesuit priests and the bombing of the civilian population.  let us recall, as a significant fact, that the united nations has condemned the government because of all it has done, especially because of the latest atrocities.  on that occasion, el salvador was the only country that voted against that resolution while 96 countries voted in favor.    we mention this case as a most significant one, but the fact is that there has been so much worldwide condemnation that the dictatorship has found itself in a really desperate situation.  this was a cause of concern for the north americans.    to whom could they turn at a time when all international organizations had turned their backs on cristiani?  the north americans had to resort to some forum that would not condemn the genocidal regime and that, on the contrary, would provide support in spite of all the atrocities the regime has committed.    the most suitable idea was to promote an emergency meeting of central american presidents, because in central america, as we all know, the north americans have had their backyard and most of these countries serve their interests.    the meeting was called to try to pull cristiani out of international isolation.    under what conditions did summit take place?  we have to say first that the presidents of el salvador and costa rica, and probably of guatemala, had reached an agreement prior to the meeting.  the subject of the discussion was a document drafted by arias and cerezo.  this document expressed support for cristiani from the very beginning. joseph sullivan, a u.s. state department official in charge of latin american affairs, as well as other u.s.  state department officials, were present at the meeting.  the costa rican ambassador to nicaragua -- a pro-u.s. man who introduced the nicaraguan contras at the meeting -- was also present, conspiring all the time.  the fmln was not even allowed to enter costa rica.    however, in spite of the fact that the meeting had been fixed and in spite of the u.s. presence, the agreement to support cristiani was achieved almost at the price of killing the esquipulas agreement.  it was not easy.  the u.s. will to condemn the fmln and to back cristiani prevailed in the midst of much bickering and the insolence of the honduran president.    as you can see, it was not easy to find support for the genocidal regime even in places where the north americans think they have the bull by the horns.    let us see, as a third point, in what the declaration consists.

(begin recording) (maza) the das has evidence showing that this individual masterminded two attacks including the the most recent and worst one in which more than 60 innocent people were killed.    (reporter) how do you know that gonzalo rodriguez gacha masterminded the recent attack on das?    (maza) because the investigations that we have conducted along with the national police ever since the attack occurred point in that direction.  if we compare the modus operandi of rodriguez and his people, we come to the conclusion that the period between the (word indistinct) and the action itself are very similar.  furthermore, this man was in there celebrating the genocide that he had committed in bogota.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (maza) because the intelligence reports indicate this, and according to certain statements we have, he was overjoyed by the damage that he had caused in the city given the large number of people who were killed; seeing him sunbathing and swimming on the atlantic coast led us to believe this.    (reporter) is this a police reaction to the drug traffickers' attack on das?    (maza) no, i am not saying that it is a reaction.  this is the result of very professional work on the part of the national police. that is what i told the president today.  i briefed him on the events which led to the action that has changed the situation which had prevailed in the country just a few hours ago.

    "doctext": "good evening.  i have called this news conference to read a foreign ministry communique: (words indistinct) today the panamanian government told luis sandiga cabrera, our charge d'affaires in panama, that he must leave panama in 72 hours.    2.  we have expressed to the panamanian government, through the panamanian charge d'affaires in lima, our surprise and strong protest over that decision.    3.  in view of this decision, the peruvian government has decided to reduce the personnel of its diplomatic mission in panama and to maintain its relations with that country at the first secretary level. peru will in this way continue to fulfill the humanitarian mission of protecting those who have sought asylum in its embassy in panama while the panamanian government issues the safe-conducts that we requested in accordance to the convention on diplomatic asylum signed in caracas on 28 march 1954.    peru is contacting the members of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement (group of eight) to explain the situation and to ask for solidarity and cooperation in overcoming this momentary crisis.    the delicate situation regarding the people at the peruvian embassy has provoked our justified alarm and impelled us to begin talks to ensure that their diplomatic asylum will be respected.  we have talked with the ambassadors from the countries of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement.  i have personally spoken with the ambassadors of venezuela, mexico, and colombia.    i am now ready to answer any questions:    (reporter) mr larco cox, unofficial sources have said that the people in the peruvian embassy in panama are not exactly political refugees but common criminals.  what do you say about this?    (larco cox) the country that grants asylum determines this.  we have been very careful to review each one of them and their files.  we have checked to see if any of them were facing any trials in panama or the united states.  our investigation has revealed that none of them are facing any trials.  the charges were made afterward.  we see this as a result of the emotional climate presently existing in panama.    (reporter) what is your personal opinion of the incident?    (larco cox) it is the diplomatic way to express a protest over what they have been led to believe.  according to panamanian reports, charge d'affaires luis sandiga has made statements on the situation that did not please the government.  the truth is that sandiga has not made any declarations.  however, former ambassador castro arenas is in panama and he has embarked on a campaign in which he is seeking retaliation against the peruvian government.  he could not think of anything better than to point at sandiga as the person responsible for alleged statements.  sandiga has not said a word about the situation because that is not his job.  besides, his car and the car belonging to one of the embassy's military attaches have been stolen; there is no way to begin an investigation.    (reporter) are you saying that former ambassador castro arenas is directly responsible for the situation?    (larco cox) you can make your own conclusions.    (reporter) if the situation deteriorates, will peru recall all of its personnel from panama?    (larco cox) we cannot go to that extreme because we are fulfilling a humanitarian cause, as we said in the communique.  our first responsibility at this time is to see that the right of asylum is respected.  as long as the refugees remain in the embassy, we will maintain our representation at the level of first secretary.

    "doctext": "concerning the prospects for the dialogue - negotiation based on the mediation of un secretary general javier perez de cuellar and the debate in the u.s.  congress on the aid to el salvador, the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) reports:    1.  we have viewed with great concern the government and army's rejection mr perez de cuellar's participation in the dialogue - negotiation process as a mediator.  this attitude is an obstacle to a process that could facilitate the negotiation effort.  on our part, we have accepted this mediation and we have undertaken efforts to achieve it.    2. the state of siege, the assassination of social democratic leader hector oqueli, the doubtful and insufficient initial results in the case of the jesuit priests, the absence of conditions for the political activity of the opposition, the continuation of the persecution of churches, and the lack of freedom of speech through the direct or covert gagging of the press show that cristiani's government is carrying out a policy of confrontation with all the country's social and political forces.  for this reason, the terms of the dialogue - negotiation must be reoriented so that it will be turned into a national process with the participation of all those forces.    3. we view as gravely erroneous the persistence of a government policy based on the idea of the fmln's alleged military weakness.  this position, similar to the one that was put forth prior to 11 november (date of the beginning of the fmln military offensive) will only lead the country to greater levels of confrontation.    4. we reaffirm our willingness to hold the meeting of both sides with the un secretary general soon.  we hope that mr cristiani's visit to the united nations will lead to such a meeting and that we can agree with the mediator on the date to hold it.    5.  we believe that the u.s. aid to the salvadoran government is directed against democratization and a political solution.  the sending of signals to one or another sector of the government or army, using the pressure of setting conditions or threatening the end of aid, does not resolve the problem.  we believe the members of the u.s. congress can make an important contribution to end the war in our country by agreeing to suspend that aid, something which could form part of a negotiated agreement that would simultaneously entail a cease-fire.

(moderator) aida montalvo.    (montalvo) in regard to the renegotiation of the foreign debt, when are you planning to go to mexico, and how will the salvadoran debt with that country be renegotiated?    (cristiani) the timetable for the trip is still undecided.  there is not definite date.  i think it may take place in april or may of this year.  our first scheduled visit will be to venezuela.    (moderator) carlos mario marquez of agence france presse.    (marquez) (words indistinct) social aspects.  i would like to know what the status is of that, since some support having primary meetings and then a summit, so to speak?    (cristiani) i do not think that is the cause of that problem.  we said that the resumption of the talks must take place when the fmln enters the dialogue process with a serious attitude.  we maintain our stance that they must stop all violence that is directly and indirectly affecting civilians, that is, all the terrorist activities the fmln conducts.  this is a small request that obtained the support of all the central american presidents at the san isidro coronado meeting in costa rica.    i think that this is the cause of the problem.  they have asked for changes in format, and we said we had no problem with most of the requests we have received.  we are now waiting for the fmln, since they asked for time to analyze things a little before having the meeting.  we are awaiting the visit of mr. de soto in early march. obviously, the dialogue has not taken place because there are some differences, (words indistinct).  i think the chief difference is that the fmln does not want to agree to stop terrorist actions, and that is why there is no dialogue now.    (moderator) epigmenio ibarra.    (ibarra) mr. president, yesterday in nicaragua, daniel ortega said at a rally that he will wage a constructive opposition.  he said that the revolution did not die with the elections.  he said that the sandinist national liberation front (fsln) will rule from below.  we sense a pretty complex climate for the transition in nicaragua.  what do you think about daniel ortega's statements?  how do you view the possibility that there may be a true transition from power to power instead of a transition of government in nicaragua?    (cristiani) as i have said before, statements by ortega and other representatives of the sandinist front are a source of concern.  they could indicate that the elections may have been very free and honest, but also a farce as far as improving the democratic process is concerned.  the nicaraguan people would be denied the right to freely pick their rulers and the right of these rulers to act as they deem best.  i would say that the nicaraguan revolution belongs not just to the fsln.  the fsln was one of the participants in the revolution in nicaragua against anastasio somoza.  the fact is that a consensus existed among all sectors that supported that revolution.  the fsln has no monopoly on or exclusive control over that revolution.    i believe that in ideological terms there are differences between the views of ms. chamorro and uno (national opposition union), that is, the new government-elect, and the views of the fsln.  yet, the people picked the government.  it is worrisome to hear some statements that the fsln will rule from below.  we believe they would seek to do that by keeping control over the army.  let me repeat: there is nothing democratic about a political party controlling the army.  the army must respond to the government and the country's democratic process, and not to just one political party.  we believe things have not been settled yet.  we believe that there are still many things left pending.

(end recording)    in reply to these statements by president cerezo, the u.s. embassy pointed out in its communique of 6 march that the u.s. government had supported the esquipulas ii peace process from the very beginning.  it added that ever since the signing of the esquipulas accord, guatemala has received $600 million in u.s. aid.  this shows, according to the embassy, that u.s. support for guatemalan democracy continued to be strong after the signing of the esquipulas ii document.    in any case, from president cerezo's perspective the u.s.  attitude in this situation reflects the traditional inclination of that country's governments throughout history to dictate rules to other nations regarding what they should do.  cerezo compared guatemala's situation in matters of criminal investigation to the situation in several u.s. cities where the police are unable to control crime.  as an example, he cited washington, d.c., where assaults, murders, and crimes frequently related to drug consumption have reached very astonishing levels in the past few years.    as for the departure of ambassador strook, cerezo said that the diplomat has not been withdrawn from guatemala, but returned to the united states for consultations by order of the state department.  in statements made minutes after receiving the credentials of the new frg ambassador, however, cerezo said that his return was, to a certain extent, due to a decision we made.",

(passage omitted)    witnesses said they heard two bursts of gunfire: one burst of three shots lasting three seconds and another burst of seven to eight shots lasting longer.  gen. leigh's secretary, joanna santis retamal, came to a window to report the incident.    other reports said that the two individuals broke into the offices and entered gen. leigh's private office.  (passage omitted)    the individuals used 9 mm semiautomatic pistols.  according to the experts, gen. ruiz was hit three times and gen gustavo leigh was hit five times.  the bullets hit gen. leigh in his eye, nose, right arm, right leg, and stomach.    the two attackers then walked down the stairs and escaped toward providencia.  (passage omitted)    the government has expressed its strong condemnation of the attack on gen. gustavo leigh, the former commander in chief of the air force and member of the military regime's government junta.  on his way to the hospital on express orders of the president, interior minister enrique krauss rejected the attack:    (begin recording) (krauss) we have asked the police authorities to fully clarify this incident.  these attitudes and acts do not help in the effort required to reunite all chileans.  (end recording)    krauss said it was a regrettable incident because it hurt the spirit and purpose of the government and opposition's work.  the attack against leigh would make a good pathological study, the minister added.  (passage omitted)    the national coordinating board for political prisoners has said the attack on gustavo leigh does not reflect the current situation in the country.  communist party leader jorge martinez, movement of the revolutionary left (mir) leader carlos ruig, and manuel rodriguez patriotic front (fpmr) leader francisco escobar heard the news while holding a news conference at the prison house.    the fpmr's francisco escobar said he is sure his organization was not involved in the incident because, as he said, we are not going to achieve anything with it.  (passage omitted)    mir representative carlos ruig said that the mir would not carry out any armed action at this time, irrespective of the level of gen. leigh's involvement in past repressions.    communist leader jorge martinez said that he is committed to respecting the democratic transition.  he said that he does not believe that this type of action will contribute to the country's progress and stability.",

    "doctext": "good afternoon, we have just received a statement issued by president virgilio barco vargas concerning the murder of mr.  carlos pizarro leongomez.  the message reads as follows:    carlos pizarro's murder is a monstrous crime that has cut short the life of a man who had shown his will for peace and his commitment to colombia.  the crime was directed at hindering the development of the electoral process and destroying the reconciliation process that the government and m-19 (19 april movement) carefully constructed, surpassing many obstacles.  in this case, as in many others, this painful tragedy should serve to consolidate the ideals of peace and pluralism for which so many colombians have struggled -- one of them, carlos pizarro.  it should serve to reassert our repudiation of violence and our faith in democratic procedures.    further on the president's message notes:    pizarro's relatives and his followers know that the government, and i personally, feel strong wrath and sadness, but we will not be discouraged.  we will uphold the banners of reconciliation, pluralism, and the right to freely and peacefully express any idea.  we will also continue to unmask and combat enemies of peace.    the president adds in his message:    i interpret the desire of all colombians who admired carlos pizarro's democratic vocation, by warning those who are responsible for this tragic murder that they will not manage to destroy what has been worked for so hard and with the support of political forces and the people who voted for peace on 11 march to open a road for peace that is clear, possible, and defined.    the president's message continues:    you know that during this peace process, many enemies and difficulties were surpassed, but none has been so large as this tragedy that has shaken all colombians.  the obligation that lies before us is to keep open the road to peace that the murderers of carlos pizarro want to destroy.  article 95 of the electoral code indicates that when a presidential candidate dies, another person in his own movement has the right to take his place.  in compliance with this norm, the government will offer every facility for the registry of a new m-19 presidential candidate, so that he can continue to hoist the flags of peace and pluralism as is proper for a democratic debate.    the president also says in his message:    i have asked the government minister and the peace adviser to meet as soon as possible with m-19 representatives so that together they may study alternatives to confront such a serious situation. as soon as possible, the government minister will also direct contacts with the rest of the political forces to request their opinions about the present situation and to continue to give all the necessary guarantees so that the electoral process may develop according to what is established in the constitution and our laws.    the message ends:    i invite all colombians who are tired of so much violence to come to the polls in the next elections and vote for peace and pluralism. i invite all political and social forces to join in solidarity with the electoral process and defend the institutions that are threatened by violence.  it is time for good sense and prudence.  it is time to rise to the occasion and show our commitment to democracy.    this is the text of president virgilio barco's message on the murder mr. carlos pizarro leongomez.",

    "doctext": "salvadoran president alfredo cristiani stated today that it would be no problem for the fourth penal judge, who is in charge of the case of the jesuits murdered by a group of soldiers, to order that cadets who are taking courses abroad return to the country.  it was recently reported that several officers who testified during these investigations are now attending training courses abroad.  it was also reported that the military school's registration book for persons entering or leaving the premises had been lost, including the pages that correspond to november 1989. today, cristiani talked about this matter and said the judge should continue to investigate and not just make statements concerning the problems.    (begin recording) (cristiani) i do not believe there is any problem in the officers returning to the country if a judge orders that they come to testify.  all that is required is for the judge to summon them; they would be brought to the country to testify and, after that, returned to their training courses.  groups of soldiers are frequently sent abroad to take training courses to make them more professional; this applies not only to personnel from the military school, but from all armed forces units.    concerning the other matter, the judge has to investigate it.  i believe that instead of just staying there, the judge should continue to search for evidence.  tell me, what is the difference if they are brought back from suchitoto or from the united states if they must testify before the judge?  there is no difference at all.  (end recording)    the president spoke today at the el salvador military airport before he left for costa rica to attend the inauguration ceremony of president-elect rafael calderon fournier.  he also said that the united states conditioning 50 percent of the aid given to our country could cause the rebel front to increase their actions.  he accused the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) of using dialogue for tactical reasons.    (begin recording) (cristiani) we have stated that an action of this type would be very untimely, as it could make the most radical fmln members decide to continue the war and, thus, hinder the dialogue process.    (reporter) however, (words indistinct) pressure government for them (words indistinct) with fmln.    (cristiani) i would ask the question: who has always showed goodwill and sincerely sought an agreement and who has not done this? history shows that in the past, the fmln has used the proposals by (jose napoleon) duarte's government and my own for tactical reasons. it has not been the governments.  i believe that the fmln must understand and be pressured to really search for a political solution. (end recording)    also today, the un secretary general authorized a spokesman to announce that talks between the government and fmln will be renewed on 16 may.  the panorama that surrounds this new encounter, however, presents an entirely different pattern from meetings in the past, because both sectors have met with political parties represented at the (word indistinct).  furthermore, although the government has not done the same with the country's social forces, the rebels will try to do so this week.  undoubtedly, the results that could be obtained from the dialogue could be much more important than those obtained during past negotiations, because almost all the sectors that have become involved, directly or indirectly, in the negotiating demand that the agreements attained be based on internal cooperation.",

    "doctext": "the plan included several points. the purpose of this plan was to pressure general noriega to resign from his military post in late august.    the psychological objectives of this plan were: to intensify and spread the repudiation of noriega within the fdp; to intensify and spread the repudiation of noriega's collaborators by mentioning specific names; to convince noriega that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince noriega's panamanian collaborators that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince foreign governments and noriega allies, particularly cuba and nicaragua, that he had lost fdp support and that his government was unsustainable; to convince governments that were hostile to noriega, especially venezuela and colombia, that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince foreign revolutionary movements that dealt with noriega, such as the fmln and the m-19, that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; and to move the anti-noriega sector within the fdp to support specific actions against noriega's regime.    the fdp members, officers, and troops were the targets of this plan.  we see how some were taken in by the psychological operations plan.  the targets of this plan were gen noriega, noriega's panamanian collaborators within the fdp, some civilians, foreign governments that are noriega's allies, foreign governments that are hostile to noriega, and foreign revolutionary organizations that deal with noriega. they identified all of noriega's vulnerabilities, as well as the vulnerabilities of all the targets we have already mentioned.    there were certain themes used in these psychological operations, and the media fell for them many times. this is why we repeatedly asked them not to fall for this misinformation.    these themes included: by imposing his arbitrary nature and corruption, noriega is perverting the fdp and promoting the disintegration of that military institution.  the fdp have become a mafia that is heading toward disgrace. this is a topic that has been discussed in leaflets and many publications.    by disrupting the constitutional order at his whim, noriega is provoking a profound social, economic, and political crisis that is ruining the country. this is done to hide those who are truly responsible for the crisis we are experiencing. the longer noriega remains in power, the more probable becomes a u.s., cuban, or soviet intervention.  the domestic and international conflicts provoked by noriega negatively affect the personal well-being of the fdp members and their families.    noriega's fall is inevitable and the fdp should not fall with him. to save the fdp and the republic of panama, the fdp must remove noriega from office. this is why there were siren songs that an internal coup was under way.    the state security organizations have been following this case for 5 months and we know the fugitives are in the united states. we know where they left from. no one can deny the association of certain u.s. citizens who are involved in this operation with the panamanian groups that were captured.    we have the evidence, the weapons, the instruments used for misinformation, the plans, and the maps with the targets for violence. important people who were going to be kidnapped had also been marked on these maps. they had marked the bridges that were to be destroyed.    gentlemen, we know the power of weapons and we know how to use them.  we know the damage they can do. therefore, before there was a violent confrontation between the panamanian people and their fdp, we went one step ahead of their plans. if arrests were made, it was because we wanted to avoid a confrontation with inexperienced groups that allowed themselves to be used for the personal benefit of those who received, with a siren song, the promise of the panamanian people's $30 million that eric arturo delvalle was going to use for subversive acts, bloody acts to bathe our people in blood, as in the case of the struggle of our brother countries in latin and central america.    we will not permit that. that is why we decided to go one step ahead and foil these plans that have a certain purpose and that would result in mourning and pain for panamanian families.    we have the evidence and those who were arrested were damn well arrested: alberto conte, fred boyd, and all those people who have been working behind the scenes so eduardo herrera and friends can live like kings in the united statets, so they can live their lives drinking champagne and eating pheasant.    eduardo herrera was dismissed from a diplomatic post for smuggling 40 boxes of whiskey per week into israel.  he is the kind of person protected by the pentagon and elliott abrams. he is elliott abrams' hero.    theresa wellington of the (u.s.) embassy in mexico, who gave these people--who left panama for mexico-- their visas in 10 minutes by abrams' orders, has also become one of our people's enemies.

(begin recording) (rueda) communications to and from puerto petrolero and bucaramanga have been cut off since early today, after an attempt to dynamite the multipurpose pipeline destroyed a 100-meter section of the central highway.    the supply of gas to bucaramanga will also be affected by this event. it is estimated that it will take at least 3 days to restore normal traffic, because it will be necessary to use dynamite to remove rocks currently blocking the highway.    the attempted sabotage occurred at the 65-km mark on the bucaramanga - barrancabermeja highway, 20 km from the place where a military convoy was ambushed last wednesday. this is the second time that an attempted sabotage of the bucaramanga - barrancabermeja multipurpose pipeline, which carries propane gas, gasoline, and acpm (not further identified) has taken place. the explosion destroyed a 30-meter section of pipeline, and sparked a fire that has not yet been extinguished.    losses caused by the sabotage, which has been attributed to the eln, have yet to be ascertained. it is estimated that repairs to the highway alone will cost the public works ministry 5 million pesos.    (ismael orozco, public works director for the 5th district) well, after initial talks with ecopetrol (colombian petroleum enterprise) technicians today, beginning at 1700, after the fire is under control, they will begin restoring service on the oil pipeline.    (rueda) at this time, there is traffic congestion near the sugamoso bridge. (end recording) (passage omitted)    while still on the subject, ecopetrol's president, who traveled this morning to barrancabermeja to attend a forum on the magdalena river, reported that, so far this year, terrorist attacks have cost his company $300 million.  we have this report from maria clara gracia.    (begin recording) (gracia) ecopetrol has lost 95 billion pesos in revenues this year due to the 44 terrorist attacks on the cano limon - covenas oil pipeline. in these attacks, 13.2 million barrels of crude oil have been lost. the areas most affected by these attacks are in sucre, arauca, norte de santander, and santander departments.    (reporter alvaro ayala) doctor, could these terrorist attacks lead to an increase in fuel prices in colombia?    (dr andres restrepo londono, president of ecopetrol) obviously, there will come a time when, faced with increasing internal production costs and falling revenues, we are going to have to consider compensating our losses with an increase in domestic oil prices, but that is a measure we are not about to adopt at this time.    (gracia) today's landslide, which destroyed a section of the multipurpose pipeline between barrancabermeja and bucaramanga, has resulted in estimated losses totalling 1.435 billion pesos.

(passage omitted)    there is political weakness, because the armed forces are not given clear missions. we see the actions of the armed forces and the security corps are frustrated, because they spend time, effort, and men capturing terrorists while the government subsequently releases them for humanitarian reasons.    i believe the government must apply the laws more forcefully and stop deceiving the population with words such as democratization and with its great political demagogy.

(duarte) we are analyzing the available evidence in those cases. you know that i have carefully analyzed the cases. i released information only when the evidence was duly investigated and corroborated. we are processing a sizable amount of information, but i do not want to discuss it in detail because i believe that this would hinder the investigation.

(reporter) violence has increased recently and the people are extremely worried. what are the armed forces doing to guarantee the people's welfare?    (vides) the salvadoran people's concern about increased terrorist violence is understandable. we must bear in mind that terrorist acts always escalate when important events are expected. this does not happen only in our country; we recently saw it in seoul, before the olympics, when groups resorted to violence to provoke the authorities and prevent an international event from taking place.    an oas meeting is scheduled to take place in this country in a few days. the event is being threatened by a number of acts, particularly terrorist acts in the san benito, max diaz, escalon, and san francisco neighborhoods.  the terrorists believe the people will protest against the oas meeting if they cause terror in those areas.    we are expecting foreign ministers from latin america, central america, and the united states, whom the terrorists believe will call off the meeting because of the situation in the country. that is the main reason for the increased violence.    you have seen that we have increased patrol operations recently. patrols are also being carried out around the volcanoes near san salvador. security measures are also being implemented on the periphery of san salvador and around the meeting venue, but i cannot give you the details. there is also a complete security plan for the officials who will participate in the oas meeting.    we are ready to reduce the possibility of an incident to a minimum. however, i have always been honest and i must admit there is always the possibility of sabotage or a terrorist act. this does not necessarily mean that it will affect the security measures in the area of the meeting. for example, a blackout can be caused by cutting off an electric line in a distant area.    (reporter) general, the fmln's attacks have not been so overwhelming in the past, yet now those attacks are attaining considerable military success. do the fmln's military actions mean it is superior to the armed forces?    (vides) we cannot conceive their military superiority under any circumstances. i have noticed the guerrilla leaders are currently visiting different countries, particularly the contadora group members. they are trying to gain support for reading a statement at the oas meeting, and they are also trying to pressure the salvadoran government into negotiating with them. this proves the rebels have failed militarily, and that failure has been brought about by our large-scale operations in northern chalatenango department and usulutan department, in the east of the country.    the rebels have tried to bring the war to urban areas.  however, the plans of subversive groups--i showed you the documents on their fire plan in another meeting--did not include the type of terrorist acts that we have seen lately. instead, they planned a general uprising and strike before the elections.    this proves, as i said, that the subversives could not develop their fire plan. they have carried out several acts but they have failed to achieve the expected results.  this is like having a cinema show a movie every day with no-one turning up to see it.    the subversives are trying to carry out this type of event right now to give the impression of military strength, so the oas will pass a resolution recommending negotiation to solve the conflict.    furthermore, the rebels are trying to discredit the democratic process and boycott our next elections because some people are demoralized by terrorism and lack the will to participate in politics, which makes the election results unsatisfactory.

    "doctext": "a new diplomatic rift has arisen between colombia and the neighboring republic of venezuela following a protest note sent by our foreign ministry to the venezuelan foreign ministry. the note denounces the massacre of 14 fishermen, including two colombians whom the venezuelan armed forces accused of being subversives.    the venezuelan government decided that it would not be scolded by colombia, so the venezuelan foreign ministry sent a note to our foreign ministry which said that venezuela rejected the terms used in the colombian protest note.    colombia has sent 17 foreign ministry notes to venezuela in the past 2 years, all concerning incidents that have directly or indirectly affected colombian citizens.  only 2 of the 17 protest notes have received a reply, and they never included the results of the investigations requested by our government.    the last note represents a protest from our government for the murder of jose antonio aregua and justo pastor ceballos on 29 october. they were assassinated along with 12 venezuelan citizens when the venezuelan army mistook them for national liberation army rebels in cano colorada, arauca department, along the venezuelan border.    even though there is evidence that the venezuelan authorities made a mistake, the country's reply to the note was spiteful and unsatisfactory. this represents the worst diplomatic incident between the two countries so far this year.    ildegar perez, venezuelan ambassador to colombia, personally referred to the state of relations between the two countries:    (begin recording) (perez) let us say that relations at this point are delicate, but i would not characterize them as critical or extremely difficult. (end recording)    the venezuelan government has ordered that the two survivors of the 29 october massacre at the border be tried. moreover, the dispute between the two countries is being exploited in the venezuelan presidential campaign.  very few, however, dare to speak the truth about the situation.    (venezuelan deputy juvencio pulgar) (begin recording) we have disputes and we should not cover them up. colombia and venezuela have things to protest about, but only a dialogue will lead to an agreement to settle these disputes.

(villagran) right now, the political and diplomatic commission, on directions from the urng general command, is making every effort to humanize the war situation in the country, especially by showing respect for the geneva agreement, which guatemala signed.    we are doing this because the repressive war the army has been waging against the revolutionary movement and the population has reached levels of extreme cruelty, including indiscriminate bombings and the use of defoliants in conflict zones where civilians live.    there is the particular situation in which neither the guatemalan army nor the government take any war prisoners. this makes us believe that the cruelty used against civilians and people involved in the armed conflict is a violation of human rights.    (martinez) does the urng have any prisoners at this moment?    (villagran) yes. we have sent a note to the national reconciliation commission so it can handle the case of soldier carlos perez lopez, who was captured wounded in the san marcos region, near galvez. he has been given much medical attention. now that he has fully recovered, we are thinking about publicly returning this guatemalan, and we are asking the reconciliation commission to take measures through the international red cross (irc) to receive this man in the framework of the humanization process.    (martinez) will this be the first time the urng will make this kind of contact with the irc?    (villagran) the irc has had localization problems.  there has been the argument that there is a national red cross. contact with the irc is possible if there is a presence of this organization that functions based on international agreements. now that the irc is present, the work is being facilitated.    the contact with the irc is at the initiation level.  however, i believe these contacts will be very useful in the future, especially for persons not involved in the armed conflict.    (martinez) i think it would be useful if we close this interview with you repeating the name of the guatemalan army soldier who is being held by the urng and whom the guerrilla forces are prepared to turn over to the irc.    (villagran) yes. his name is carlos lopez perez (as heard).    (martinez) thank you, villagran.",

(begin recording) (pardo) the government cannot assume that responsibility with private individuals. our peace initiative calls for a direct dialogue with guerrillas who are committed to a reconciliation, once the right conditions are present. this position remains unchanged.    (reporter) does this mean senator alvaro leiva's proposal has not been taken into account?    (pardo) no, the government will respond to dr leiva's proposal in the next few days. his proposal has brought about positive results in the sense that the farc and m-19 have expressed their desire to suspend terrorist acts. the government will announce a formal response to this proposal in the next few days. (end recording)    meanwhile, former presidents belisario bethancourt and misael pastrana borrero urged that a commission be formed for talks with the rebels, which they consider the best chance for peace.",

    "doctext": "the peruvian governing party, apra, today ended a conflictive party congress on a note of defeat for president alan garcia, and with the emergence of former prime minister luis alva castro as new party leader.    the apra congress eliminated the post of party president, which was created for alan garcia in 1985, consolidating his position as party leader following a decisive victory in the presidential election of that year.    according to some critics within the party, the personalism that had characterized garcia's undisputed leadership since 1982 was thus ended.    luis alva castro, 46, former prime minister and economy minister as well as former president of the chamber of deputies, was elected by a large margin as the new secretary general, a post which regained the highest status in the party. alva castro capitalized on the internal dissidence and on the party's disenchantment with alan garcia as a result of the deterioration of the social and economic situation, which is considered the worst crisis in this century and is blamed on the chief of state's \"stubbornness\" in not changing his nationalistic and populist policy line.\"    the new cadre elected at the 16th apra congress is in favor of a \"change in orientation\" in the party's management and in the public administration for the remaining 18 months of the apra's term in office. it is expected that alan garcia and alva castro may reach an agreement on the way the government should be run until 1990, when the current presidential term will end following new general elections.    garcia also lost the presidency of the political commission that sets the party's political line. this post was won by luis alberto sanchez, 88, first vice president of the nation and one of the mainsprings in the changeover operation within the apra.    the other elective positions were filled with apra members who do not follow garcia's line. thus, the presence of alan garcia within the party was reduced to being member of the political commission in his capacity as former party secretary general.    two days ago, the peruvian chief of state resigned the apra presidency, upset over criticism directed at him during the opening of the party congress. he thus responded to obvious signs that the party president post would be eliminated.    the apra had thought alan garcia would be a very capable heir to victor raul haya de la torre, the party's founder and historical leader, who died in 1979. three and one-half years after garcia's election victory, the party disqualified garcia for the role of haya de la torre's successor because of his errors and his failure to rectify his government line.    following the tradition initiated by alan garcia, new apra leader luis alva castro will be sworn in as secretary general this coming friday before the tomb of haya de la torre in the northern city of trujillo, the apra's main bastion.    the economic crisis, marked by 2,000-percent inflation and a 20-percent recession from october 1987 to october 1988, is compounded by social instability and political violence, with killings averaging four per day.    an internal political storm hit the apra 16th national congress, and vice president sanchez said that he cannot recall anything similar.    during the last session of the congress, three youths were injured in a melee among apra people. other party members were hit on the head with handgun butts, and three newsmen--who had not been allowed to attend the proceedings of the congress--were attacked.",
