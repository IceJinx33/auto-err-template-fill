BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS\nTHE AIR FORCE CHIEF.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT\nWITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN\n(FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE\nSALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.  BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN\nOF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL\nSALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER.\n\n   FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.S. SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE\nAIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE\nDEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE\nCOUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN,\nTOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE\nGENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN\nEL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO.  BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS\nAND U.S. AMBASSADORS HAVE.  AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE\nIMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN\nEL SALVADOR.\n\n   AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE\nOF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS.  HE ACCUSES (FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER\nEUGENIO) VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN.  ONE\nWOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS\nMOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS,\nMONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT\nMURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.  WAS THE U.S. PENTAGON SOFT\nWHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF\nGENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY?\n\n   THE U.S. STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE\nPAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT\nREBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED\nHAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE.  BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY.\n\n   THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND.  THROUGH AN\nACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE\nNEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE.  BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES\nGENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE.  BUSTILLO\nACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE\nTOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.  A\nPOLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR\nSECTORS.  OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY.\nBUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR\nDEMOCRACY.  IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL\nOPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT\nSUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY.  IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS\nNOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION.  THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS\nIT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT\nTHEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES:\nTO STOP THE FMLN.\n\n   THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF\nTHE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG\nDEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID.  THE JESUITS' MURDERS\nAND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING\nFOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS.  HOWEVER, THE\nBUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE (CHAIRMAN\nOF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF) AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER\nTHIS RESPONSIBILITY.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN\nDEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS.\n\n   BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL\nBEGIN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID.  BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S\nSCAPEGOAT.  HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS\nMACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE.  WILL THE U.S. PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE\nAPPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY?  TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE\nOBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR.  WHILE PEOPLES\nOF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO\nLEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER,\nCOMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH,\nTHE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  GOODBYE, GEN. BUSTILLO.  WE CONTINUE\nWRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU.  THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY,\nINDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.

IT IS CLEAR THAT COL BENAVIDES DID NOT GIVE THE ORDER.  HE\nPROBABLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE ACTION.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT\nWE KNOW ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.  FIRST, HE IS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE CARRIED OUT\nACTS OF REPRESSION OR CORRUPTION.

IN OTHER WORDS, FOR THE\nLA TANDONA, A GANG OF ASSASSINS, HE IS A PERFECT SCAPEGOAT.\n\n   THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUITS WAS NOT A PERSONAL DECISION.  IT WAS PART OF\nTHE ARMED FORCES' COUNTEROFFENSIVE ACTIONS DURING THE NOVEMBER BATTLES.  IT\nWAS A COLD-BLOODED, PREMEDITATED PLAN EXECUTED TO DECAPITATE THE PEOPLE'S\nMOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION.

LET US REMEMBER THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 15 NOVEMBER AND\nEARLY MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SEVERAL OFFICES OF LABOR UNIONS AND HOUSES OF\nOPPOSITION MEMBERS WERE ATTACKED.  LET US REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE MASSSACRE\nOF THE JESUITS, THE OFFICERS SHOUTED OVER LOUDSPEAKERS THAT THEY HAD KILLED\nELLACURIA AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE KILLING COMMUNISTS.  THE\nBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS.\n\n   IN OUR VIEW, THE ASSASSINS OF THE JESUITS WERE THOSE WHO APPEARED ON THE\nRADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK MAKING KNOWN THE RESULTS OF THE SO-CALLED HONOR\nCOMMISSION.  COL BENAVIDES WILL PROBABLY BE FREED IN A SHORT TIME AND BE\nAPPOINTED TO SOME POST ABROAD, OR HE MIGHT EXPERIENCE THE SAME FATE AS THAT\nOF CAPTAIN EDUARDO ALFONSO AVILA, WHO WENT IN AND OUT OF JAIL EACH TIME THAT\nMILITARY AID FOR EL SALVADOR WAS DISCUSSED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS.\n\n   HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE AND AS HAS ALWAYS OCCURRED, IT WILL BE THE\nLIEUTENANTS, THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND THE SOLDIERS WHO CARRIED OUT\nAN ORDER WHO WILL PAY THE CONSEQUENCES.

WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH SOME\nGUIDELINE--SOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED--NOT JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF\nOUR TERM BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE FARSIGHTED\nAND NOT JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE SHORT TERM, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY COMMON\nIN HONDURAS, WHERE WE LOOK AND FIND SOLUTIONS ONLY FOR THE PRESENT.\nWE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS JOINTLY (WORDS INDISTINCT) IN THE LONG RUN,\nWHICH INCLUDES THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE.  WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE\nOURS, WHICH IS A VERY COMPLETE DEMOCRACY.  IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE\nINTERNAL ELECTIONS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES, WHERE CITIZENS ENJOY FULL\nRIGHTS, WHERE PARTIES AND PARTY LEADERS CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE, WHERE\nWE HAVE TRUE, CLEAN, AND HONEST ELECTIONS, WHERE WE HAVE A NATIONAL\nELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY NOR CAN IT BE\nINFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHERE THE STATE BRANCHES ARE TOTALLY\nINDEPENDENT.\n\n   ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE HONDURAS A DEMOCRACY, AND EVERY\nSECTOR OF HONDURAN SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THEM BY AVOIDING\nVIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS, OBEYING THE LAW, AND CONDEMNING AND ATTACKING\nEXTREME TERRORIST GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION, THUS ENABLING US\nTO CONSOLIDATE OUR DEMOCRACY AND REACH THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT\nATTAINED BY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.\n\n   IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WORLDWIDE THAT PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN\nONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DEMOCRACY.  THE FRG, THE MEDITERRANEAN\nCOUNTRIES--ITALY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN--ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS, AND THERE IS\nTHE CASE OF JAPAN, WHICH HAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND HAS ACHIEVED\nEXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT.  TAIWAN IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE.  AT\nTHIS STAGE...\n\n   (VALDES, INTERRUPTING) YES, BUT THIS TAKES TIME.\n\n   (AZCONA) YES.  AT THIS STAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT\nTHE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF\nDEVELOPMENT.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT\nTHAT WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ENOUGH.  EACH ONE OF US, EACH SECTOR, MUST\nDO HIS PART TO MAKE IT WORK.\n\n   WHEN I MENTION SECTORS, I AM REFERRING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WHICH\nMUST BE GENEROUS, EXHIBIT CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND SHOW MUCH\nINITIATIVE; TO ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS, WHICH MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS\nWITHOUT FOMENTING STRIKES AND OTHER DISORDERS, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT\nABOUT ILLEGALLY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORMAL LEGAL PROCEDURES; TO\nPROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY,\nBECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS MUST COMPLY WITH THEIR DUTIES; AND THE SAME GOES FOR\nGOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.\n\n   IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS OR THE NEXT\nGOVERNMENT ALONE.  OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE TRANSITORY AND THEIR POWER IS\nRELATIVE.  I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES.  THERE IS NO POINT IN LASHING OUT\nAT THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE POWER IN HONDURAS IS RELATIVE AND CONDITIONAL.\nWHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TOWARD HONDURAS'\nDEVELOPMENT.  THIS SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF PUBLIC\nEMPLOYEES, BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND ORGANIZED PEASANTS, BUT ALL HONDURANS\nSHOULD CONTRIBUTE.  THAT IS WHAT COUNTS.\n\n   (VALDES) MR PRESIDENT, WHEN WILL THIS MEETING BE HELD AND WHAT IMMEDIATE\nMEASURES WILL YOU PROPOSE?\n\n   (AZCONA) THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO\nINVESTIGATE THE LATEST CRIME, WHICH WAS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE LIKE A\nROBBERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.  THIS CRIME WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED.  IT\nWAS A TERRORIST ACT PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS.\n\n   (VALDES) MR PRESIDENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE DEATH\nPENALTY MIGHT BE A WAY TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.  WHAT DO YOU THINK\nABOUT THIS?\n\n   (AZCONA) I RECENTLY READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IN A MEXICAN\nMAGAZINE.  THE DEATH PENALTY IS OPPOSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND HAS\nBEEN ABOLISHED IN HONDURAS.  I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION HERE\nBECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS NOT SOLVED THE CRIME PROBLEM ANYWHERE ELSE IN\nTHE WORLD.  FOR INSTANCE, THIS PENALTY EXISTS IN MANY U.S. STATES, BUT THIS\nHAS NOT DETERRED CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING TERRIBLE CRIMES.  PEOPLE HAVE\nLOST CONTROL.  WHEN CRIMINALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, NOT\nEVEN THE DEATH PENALTY CAN STOP THEM.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRIMES, SUCH AS\nDRUG TRAFFICKING, FOR WHICH NO BAIL SHOULD BE PERMITTED.  I THINK A BILL\nTHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE PASSED BY\nTHE CONGRESS.  OF COURSE, IT WILL BE APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT SO THOSE\nFOUND GUILTY OF THIS CRIME CANNOT BE BAILED OUT.  IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE\nAUTHORITIES TO ARREST A DRUG TRAFFICKER ONLY TO SEE HIM RELEASED ON BAIL\nBY A JUDGE WHO HAS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ABIDE BY THE LAW.\n\n   (VALDES) MR PRESIDENT, THE FAR RIGHTIST GROUP AAA (ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION\nALLIANCE), THROUGH A LOCAL RADIO STATION, WARNED THAT THEY WILL TAKE\nREVENGE ON MAJOR COMMUNIST LEADERS, SUCH AS JORGE ARTURO REINA, RAMON\nCUSTODIO, AND OTHERS.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?\n\n   (AZCONA) I AM ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF REVENGE BECAUSE IT WOULD\nONLY LEAD TO ESCALATED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS.  I CONDEMN THIS\nATTITUDE IN VIEW OF THE REGRETTABLE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ\nMARTINEZ.  AS FAR AS THE DEATH PENALTY GOES, IT WILL NOT BE A SOLUTION TO\nTHE CRIME PROBLEM.\n\n   (VALDES) MR PRESIDENT, CIVIC COMMITTEES HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN THE\nCOUNTRY.\n\n   (AZCONA) I AGREE, BUT THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE\nAUTHORITIES.  A CIVIC COMMITTEE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IS ONE THING, BUT IT\nIS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO SUE THESE COMMITTEES TO PERFORM DUTIES THAT ARE\nALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n   (VALDES) WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES MEET?\n\n   (AZCONA) THEY WILL MEET WHEN I RETURN FROM CARACAS.", "dateline": "TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89", "char_before": 80803, "source": "NOSC", "char_end": 87563}

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE\nSITUATION AFTER THE COWARDLY ATTACK ON FENASTRAS?\n\n   WE THINK ALL THESE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEATH SQUADS, THE 1ST INFANTRY\nBRIGADE, THE POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE ONLY THE OPEN EXPRESSION\nOF THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION, WHICH IS TO PLAN A FULL-SCALE CONFRONTATION\nWITH THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.  WE THINK THIS INDICATES (WORDS INDISTINCT)\nBEHIND THE BACKS OF THE MAJORITY OF ARMED FORCES MEMBERS.  IT IS A\nMINORITY WHO HAVE DECIDED ON THESE PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE POPULAR\nMOVEMENT.  THIS MOVEMENT, HOWEVER, IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO DISARM THESE\nPROVOCATEURS, PRESENT THEM TO THE PRESS, AND HAND THEM OVER TO SHOW THAT\nTHE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR TREMENDOUS POWER WHENEVER THEY WANT.\n\n   (REPORTER) WITH LA TANDONA (REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATES OF THE CAPTAIN\nGERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY) IN POWER, AND WITH THE SITUATION THE\nARENA (NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE) ERA HAS USHERED IN, IS THERE NO\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTION THROUGH DIALOGUE?  WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE DO YOU HAVE?\n\n   (SANCHO) I BELIEVE THAT IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND\nTHE HIGH COMMAND ARE PRACTICALLY DOING AWAY WITH POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES,\nAS OUR EARLIER COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AFTER THE FENASTRAS ATTACK INDICATES.\nTHE END RESULT IS THAT SINCE THERE IS NO POLITICAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH\nTO ESTABLISH A POLITICAL GAME WITH CERTAIN POLITICAL RULES FOR THE\nOPPOSITION AND STATE FORCES, OUR ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO IMMEDIATELY\nTAKE UP OUR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GUARANTEEING THE\nSURVIVAL OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AND THE NATION.  THE PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE\nRIGHT TO DEFENSE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, AND IT IS GAINING\nGREATER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION.\n\n   (REPORTER) THE POPULAR MOVEMENT IS ONCE AGAIN FACING A DECISIVE MOMENT\nIN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY, AND THE WORKERS ARE GIVING THEIR SHARE OF BLOOD\nIN THIS STRUGGLE.  WHAT MESSAGE WOULD YOU SEND TO THE POPULAR MOVEMENT,\nESPECIALLY TO THE COMRADE WORKERS AT FENASTRAS?\n\n   (SANCHO) ON THIS OCCASION, I WISH TO SEND A SPECIAL MESSAGE TO\nFENASTRAS.  I MUST TELL THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE INSPIRED BY THE PUREST\nCONCEPTS OF THE POPULAR STRUGGLE, TO KEEP THEIR INSPIRATION, TO BE\nCREATIVE AND COOL, AND THAT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO CREATE THEIR OWN HISTORY,\nTHEY ARE TRULY INVINCIBLE.\n\n   I BELIEVE THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE PEOPLE'S FULL SUPPORT AND THAT IT WILL\nGRADUALLY GAIN EVEN MORE SUPPORT.  FENASTRAS MUST CONTINUE--AS ITS LEADERS\nSAY--ON THE WARPATH.  IN REALITY, THE COST IN LIVES OF LEADERS SUCH AS FEBE\nELIZABETH AND ALL THE OTHERS WHO WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS THOSE KILLED IN\nTHE PAST, IS QUITE HIGH.  THE COST IS POLITICAL.  IT HAS TAKEN LIVES BUT\nTHIS, IN REALITY, STRENGTHENS THE ORGANIZATION.  THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE HAS\nBEEN ONE OF ANGER AND DISCONTENT, AND THIS DISCONTENT WILL EVENTUALLY TURN\nINTO A CLAMOR FOR ARMED STRUGGLE BY SECTORS THAT REALLY (WORDS INDISTINCT)\nAND TO ACHIEVE OUR PEOPLE'S FREEDOM.

FOR EXAMPLE,\nLAST YEAR COLOMBIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS 4.5 PERCENT.  HOWEVER, POLITICAL\nLIFE CONTINUES TO BE DOMINATED BY THE TWO OLD PARTIES -- THE LIBERALS AND\nTHE CONSERVATIVES, WHO MAINTAIN A MERELY FORMAL DEMOCRACY.  WE SHOULD NOT\nFORGET COLOMBIA'S STRATEGIC POSITION:  IT FORMS A BRIDGE BETWEEN CENTRAL AND\nSOUTH AMERICA.  ALL EVENTS IN COLOMBIA AFFECT THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  \n\n   PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THIS, THE SO-CALLED \"SANTA FE-2\" DOCUMENT, DRAWN UP\nBY EXTREME RIGHT-WING U.S. POLITICIANS, CONTAINS A PLAN TO APPLY PRESSURE IN\nCOLOMBIA AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, TO EXPAND THE SO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY\nCONFLICT, ONE OF WHOSE MANIFESTATIONS IS THE SO-CALLED \"DIRTY WAR\" IN THE\nCOUNTRY.\n\n   ACCORDINGLY, THE VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA IS CAUSED BY BOTH INTERNAL FACTORS\n-- THE CRISIS OF THE INSTITUTIONS -- AND EXTERNAL ONES, NAMELY THE POLICIES\nOF THE MOST REACTIONARY CIRCLES IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n   (SERTOV) CAN ONE EXPECT THE PEACE SETTLEMENT TO BE FULFILLED UNDER THESE\nCONDITIONS?\n\n   (CEPEDA) THIS IS THE AIM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA (PCC).  AT\nOUR RECENT 15TH CONGRESS, WE MADE A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION AND\nCONCLUDED THAT THE CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA MUST BE SETTLED BY POLITICAL MEANS.\nTHE PCC RAISED THE QUESTION OF REMOVING THE SIEGE SITUATION THAT, WITH A FEW\nINTERRUPTIONS, HAS BEEN MAINTAINED FOR SEVERAL DECADES, AND OF DISBANDING\nTHE PARAMILITARY GROUPS (ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS,\nABOUT 140 SUCH GROUPS ARE OPERATING).  THESE GROUPS OWE THEIR VERY EXISTENCE\nTO THE SUPPORT GIVEN BY MILITARY CIRCLES AND THE CLAN CHIEFS TO THE TRADE IN\nNARCOTICS.  (I WILL ADD IN PARENTHESES THAT THIS IS THE REASON FOR THE USE\nOF THE TERM \"NARCOMILITARISM\" IN COLOMBIA.) ONE OF THE PCC'S DEMANDS IS THAT\nTHE ARMY SHOULD BE PURGED OF FASCIST ELEMENTS AND THAT A CIVILIAN SHOULD BE\nPUT IN CHARGE OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.  THE PARTY ALSO RAISED THE\nQUESTION OF MAKING A START ON THE NECESSARY DEMOCRATIC REFORMS, BUT THE\nGOVERNMENT PAYS NO HEED TO OUR DEMANDS.\n\n   THE GOVERNMENT RECENTLY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH \"M-19,\" ONE OF THE\nPARTISAN GROUPINGS IN THE COUNTRY, BUT DID NOT ACCEPT ANY COMMITMENTS IN\nPRACTICE.  ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE SOME DOUBTS OVER HOW THE LIVES OF THE\nPARTISAN LEADERS WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY GUARANTEED.  THE LARGEST PARTISAN\nGROUP -- THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA -- IS DEMANDING THAT THE\nGOVERNMENT TAKE SERIOUS STEPS TO LIMIT THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS, IN ORDER TO\nCONCLUDE A TRUCE.\n\n   (SERTOV) CLEARLY, IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN COLOMBIA.\n\n   (CEPEDA) AT THE MOMENT, PEACE SUPPORTERS IN COLOMBIA ARE FORMING \nA BROAD FRONT, WHICH IN PRACTICE HAS AN ANTIFASCIST ORIENTATION.  PEACE\nDEPENDS ON HOW FAR THIS FRONT WILL SUCCEED IN EXPANDING, HOW THE\nCONTRADICTIONS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF REGARDING THE PARAMILITARY\nGROUPS WILL DEEPEN, AND ON WHETHER WE WILL SUCCEED IN ISOLATING THEM.  WE\nARE OPTIMISTS, BUT ALSO HAVE A GREAT NEED OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY.\n\n   (SERTOV) HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE POLITICAL PROSPECTS FOR THE UNITED LEFT IN\nYOUR COUNTRY?\n\n   (CEPEDA) THE LEFT FORCES IN COLOMBIA ARE UNITED IN THE PATRIOTIC UNION\nTHAT WAS CREATED 4 YEARS AGO.  ITS AIM IS TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION\nIN OUR COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, THE UNION IMMEDIATELY BECAME A TARGET OF THE\nORGANIZERS OF THE \"DIRTY WAR.\" HUNDREDS OF ITS LEADERS WERE BEATEN UP, MANY\nOF WHOM WERE PCC MEMBERS.  SO FAR, OVER 1,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED, INCLUDING\nJAIME PARDO LEAL, LEADER OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN JOSE\nANTEGUERA, AND OTHERS.  THREATS CONTINUE TO BE MADE AGAINST THE UNION AND\nAGAINST THE PCC.  ALL MEMBERS OF THE PCC LEADERSHIP HAVE RECEIVED DEATH\nTHREATS.  THE SAME ALSO APPLIES TO BERNARDO JARAMILLO, THE PRESENT LEADER OF\nTHE UNION, GILBERTO VIEIRA, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PCC CENTRAL COMMITTEE,\nAND OTHERS.\n\n   ON 27 FEBRUARY COMRADE FORERO (NAME AS TRANSLITERATED), PCC SECRETARY FOR\nORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS, WAS KILLED.  HIS WIFE AND COMRADES SOTELO AND\nSOTOMAYOR ALSO DIED IN THE ATROCITY.  NEXT DAY, WE HAD A MEETING WITH\nVIRGILIO BARCO, PRESIDENT OF COLOMBIA.  HE PROMISES TO TAKE SPEEDY MEASURES\nAGAINST THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  HOWEVER, ONLY 4 DAYS LATER, ANTEGUERA, THE\nFORMER LEADER OF THE UNION OF COMMUNIST YOUTH, WAS KILLED AT BOGOTA\nAIRPORT.  SENATOR ERNESTO PISANO, ONE OF THE LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATES FOR\nTHE PRESIDENCY, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED AT THE SAME TIME.  MANY MEMBERS OF THE\nMILITARY WERE PRESENT AT THE AIRPORT ON THAT DAY, AS WELL AS THE POLICE CHIEF\nOF THE CAPITAL, YET ONLY ONE OF THE MURDERERS WAS KILLED, WHILE THE REST\nESCAPED.  THIS IS WHY WE TOLD PRESIDENT BARCO THAT WE HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS\nABOUT THE ARMY'S ROLE IN THIS ASSASSINATION.  \n\n   NEXT YEAR, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND ELECTIONS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODIES\nARE DUE TO TAKE PLACE IN COLOMBIA.  THE PCC AND THE PATRIOTIC UNION WANT TO\nTAKE PART IN THEM, BUT WE HAVE WARNED THE LEADERS OF THE REPUBLIC THAT\nUNLESS THE \"DIRTY WAR\" IS ENDED, WE WILL EXPOSE THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA TO\nTHE WORLD AND REGARD THE ELECTION RESULTS AS ILLEGAL.

WHY?  \n\n   (CEPEDA) IN COLOMBIA THE DIRTY WAR STEMMING FROM THE AMERICAN TACTICS OF\nSO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY CONFLICT IS INTENSIFYING.  THE INTERNAL POLITICAL\nCRISIS IS DEEPENED BY AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE POWERFUL DRUG SMUGGLING CLANS\nAND THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP WHICH IS CONDUCTING THE DIRTY WAR.  IN THE SANTA\nFE II DOCUMENT, FORMULATING FUTURE UNITED STATES POLICY IN LATIN AMERICA, IT\nIS EVEN SAID THAT UNLESS THE UNITED STATES INTERVENES IN THE 1990'S COLOMBIA\nWILL BECOME ANOTHER EL SALVADOR AND ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE.  THE SO-CALLED\nEXTERMINATION OPERATION, ALSO KNOWN AS THE CONDOR PLAN, IS DIRECTED AGAINST\nTHE COMMUNIST PARTY AND UP, AGAINST THE UNIONS, BUT ALSO AGAINST PRIESTS WHO\nPREACH LIBERATION THEOLOGY, AND RECENTLY THIS HAS INTENSIFIED.  IN COLOMBIA\nSOME ELEMENTS OF FASCISM OPENLY MANIFEST THEMSELVES.  THIS IS MANIFESTED IN\nHUGE AND UNPUNISHED MASSACRES AND IN THE POWERLESSNESS OF PRESIDENT BARCO\nAND HIS CIVILIAN MINISTERS WHO ARE NOT MANAGING TO KEEP THE MILITARY\nLEADERSHIP IN CHECK, ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT IS THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE\nARMED FORCES.\n\n   (POSLEDNI) SOMETIMES PARTISANS ARE ALSO ACCUSED OF TERROR.  \n\n   (CEPEDA) THAT IS ONE OF THE TRAITS OF AMERICAN POLICY -- TO TERM ANY\nKIND OF REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE, OF STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY, AND THE\nPEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AS TERRORISM.  THEREFORE, IT ALSO LABELS THE SANDINISTAS\nIN NICARAGUA AS TERRORISTS AND THE CONTRA REBELS AS FREEDOM FIGHTERS.  BY\nTHIS I DO NOT WANT TO SAY THAT THE PARTISANS DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES, WE ALSO\nCRITICIZE THEM.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONDEMNED THE DESTRUCTION OF OIL PIPLINES\nBY THE COLOMBIAN PARTISAN ORGANIZATION THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN).\nWE DO NOT AGREE WITH KIDNAPPING CIVILIANS IN EXCHANGE FOR RANSOM.  WE\nANNOUNCED THAT, AS LONG AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO END THE CONFLICT, IT IS\nNECESSARY TO HUMANIZE IT AND TO RESPECT HUMAN LIVES.  THESE ARE THE TACTICS\nOF SOLDIERS -- TO LABEL THE PARTISANS AS TERRORISTS AND THEN MASSACRE THE\nCIVILIAN POPULATION AS SUSPECTS WHO ARE COLLABORATING WITH TERRORISM.\n\n   (POSLEDNI) PARTISANS FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA\n(FARC) OFFERED THE GOVERNMENT A DIALOGUE ABOUT A TRUCE.  HOW DO THEY WANT TO\nCONDUCT THIS?\n\n   (CEPEDA) THE FARC, WHICH IS THE STRONGEST ELEMENT OF THE COLOMBIAN\nPARTISAN MOVEMENT AND A MEMBER OF ITS COORDINATING COMMITTEE, UNILATERALLY\nADOPTED A CEASE-FIRE AND PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION FOR THIS\nDIALOGUE.  IN IT ARE TWO FORMER PRESIDENTS, THE LIBERAL LOPEZ MICHELSEN AND\nTHE CONSERVATIVE PASTRANA, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDUSTRIALISTS\nECHEVERRI CORREA, AND BOGOTA'S CARDINAL REBOLLO.  THE FARC WANTS THE\nGOVERNMENT TO DISBAND THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  THE FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER,\nGAVIRIA, SAID THAT THERE ARE 140 OF THEM.  THIS MEANS THAT THE GOVERNMENT\nKNOWS THEM.  THE FARC IS DEMANDING THE PURGE OF PEOPLE FROM THE ARMY COMMAND\nINVOLVED IN THE DIRTY WAR, THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER BE A CIVILIAN, THAT THE\nSTATE OF EMERGENCY BE REVOKED, AND THAT THE ROAD TO REAL DEMOCRACY BE OPENED.\n\n   (POSLEDNI) BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN NEGOTIATING WITH PARTISANS FROM\nM-19.\n\n   (CEPEDA) THE EL TIEMPO NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROMISED\nTHEM REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT BY THEIR INCLUSION AS CANDIDATES OF THE\nLIBERAL PARTY.  THIS IS TO INVOLVE FOUR SEATS AS LONG AS M-19 LAYS DOWN ITS\nARMS AND DISBANDS.  THE OTHER PARTISANS BITTERLY CRITICIZED THIS AS A BLOW\nAGAINST THE UNITY OF THE MOVEMENT WHICH WILL BE ABUSED FOR PROPAGANDA\nPURPOSES.  AT THE SAME TIME, M-19 REPRESENTS ONLY 5 PERCENT OF THE\nMOVEMENT.  IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO DIVIDE THE PARTISANS.\n\n   (POSLEDNI) THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS TOOK PLACE IN\nDECEMBER.  HOW DID IT REACT TO THE SITUATION?\n\n   (CEPEDA) THE PARTY CALLED FOR PEACE AND OUTLINED THE STRUGGLE FOR A\nPLURALIST GOVERNMENT OF TRANSITION TOWARDS PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  AT THE END\nOF FEBRUARY THERE WAS A CENTRAL COMMITTEE SESSION WHICH DISCUSSED THE DIRTY\nWAR.  IT STATED THAT, IN SPITE OF THE TERROR, THERE HAD NOT BEEN WHAT HAD\nHAPPENED IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS IN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, NAMELY,\nMASS EMIGRATION.  TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE, THE\nCENTRAL COMMITTEE DISCUSSED NEW MEASURES, INCLUDING THE TRANSITION OF PART\nOF THE PARTY TO THE UNDERGROUND.  WE WILL NOT ALL TRANSFER, BECAUSE NOW WE\nMUST STRUGGLE FOR OPEN CONTACT WITH THE MASSES, REGARDLESS OF THE HUGE RISK\nWHICH IS LINKED TO THIS.\n\n   (POSLEDNI) WHERE IS THE PARTY SEEKING ALLIES?  \n\n   (CEPEDA) COMRADE ANTEQUERA, AS DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE UP, HAD ESTABLISHED\nA NUMBER OF CONTACTS.  HOWEVER, HE WAS MURDERED, AND SENATOR SAMPER PISANO,\nA POLITICIAN FROM THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED DURING THE\nASSASSINATION AT BOGOTA AIRPORT ON 3 MARCH.  THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT\nAGAINST THE 32-YEAR-OLD PROSPECTIVE POLITICIAN OCCURRED THE DAY AFTER HE\nANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENCY.  HE ANNOUNCED HIS SUPPORT FOR\nDEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE, FOR AN END TO THE DIRTY WAR WHICH, AS HE SAID, IS\nNOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, HE WAS NOT A CHANCE\nVICTIM.  IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT THAT THE CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION COVERING\nTHE AIRPORT, WHICH IS IN THE HANDS OF THE ARMY, WAS SWITCHED OFF.  THUS,\nTHEY WANTED TO PREVENT THE MURDERERS BEING FILMED.  ONE OF THEM DIED, THEY\nLET THE OTHER THREE ESCAPE.  AT THE SAME TIME, BOGOTA'S CHIEF OF POLICE WAS\nAT THE AIRPORT ALONG WITH ANOTHER 10 COLONELS AND A NUMBER OF POLICEMEN AND\nPERSONAL BODYGUARDS.\n\n   (POSLEDNI) HOW DID THE OTHER PARTIES REACT TO THE ASSASSINATION?\n\n   (CEPEDA) A JOINT DOCUMENT WAS SIGNED BY THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST \nPARTY, THE UP, AND THE LIBERAL PARTY, ON WHOSE BEHALF THE FORMER PRESIDENT\nTURBAY AYALA SIGNED.  IT DEMANDS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DISBAND THE\nPARAMILITARY SQUADS.  IT SHOWS THAT OPINIONS ARE BEGINNING TO DIFFER, EVEN\nIN THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY.  THE CONSERVATIVES ARE ALSO EMPHATICALLY\nCRITICIZING THE BLOODBATH AND THE PASSIVITY OF THE GOVERNMENT, POINTING OUT\nTHAT THEIR LAST PRESIDENT, BETANCUR, CONDUCTED A DIALOGUE WITH THE\nPARTISANS.  THIS IS ALL HAPPENING BEFORE THE ELECTIONS WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE\nNEXT YEAR.\n\n   (POSLEDNI) THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP MET WITH THE\nPRESIDENT AFTER THE MURDER OF COMRADE FORERO.  WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?\n\n   (CEPEDA) IN THE CONVERSATION, WE POINTED TO THE FACT THAT THE DEFENSE\nMINISTER, GENERAL GUERRERO PAZ, TRAVELS AROUND COLOMBIA ACCOMPANIED BY THE\nLEADER OF THE ULTRA-RIGHT WING, RETIRED GENERAL LANDAZABAL REYES, WHO IS\nLEADER OF THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  WE ASKED WHY THESE TWO ARE TOGETHER.\nTHE PRESIDENT DID NOT ANSWER US.  AT THE MEETING WE ALSO SAID THAT, UNLESS\nTHE DIRTY WAR STOPS, THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN\nHISTORY WILL NOT TAKE PART IN THE ELECTIONS.  WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO\nPARTICIPATE, BECAUSE WE ARE ALL BEING MURDERED.

WE DELAYED MAKING THIS STATEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE WERE NO\nCIRCUMSTANTIAL OR OTHER REASONS THAT COULD HAVE INVOLVED US IN THE ATTACK.\n\n   2. FOLLOWING RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH, SEVERAL GROUPS HAVE CONDUCTED\nMARKEDLY VENGEFUL ACTIONS.  COLONEL OCHOA PEREZ, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS PROPOSED\nFIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE.  FRANCISCO MERINO HAS THREATENED OPPOSITION LEADERS\nWITH DEATH.

I AM A BIT CONCERNED OVER WHAT I HAVE HEARD ON\nTHIS RADIO STATION.  THE TRUTH IS THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 0030 TODAY,\nTHERE WAS AN ATTACK WITH A HOMEMADE BOMB IN LA CEIBA, AND, AS A\nRESULT, SEVEN U.S.  SOLDIERS -- NOT SIX -- WERE WOUNDED.  FOUR\nSUSTAINED VERY MINOR INJURIES, WHILE THREE WERE SOMEWHAT SERIOUSLY\nWOUNDED, BUT THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER OF DYING.  NINE SOLDIERS WERE IN\nTHAT GROUP.  THEY WERE NOT ON LEAVE; THEY WERE ON A MISSION FROM THE\nENRIQUE SOTO CANO HONDURAN AIR BASE AT PALMEROLA.\n\n   THEY PROVOKED...  (CHANGES THOUGHT).  INSTEAD, I SHOULD SAY THAT\nTHEY WENT TO HAVE SOME FUN AT THE DILIDO DISCOTEQUE. OUR MILITARY POLICE\nPATROLS WERE IN THE AREA AND SAW THE ATTACK.  WE CAPTURED TWO SUSPECTS.  OUR\nMEN WERE ABOUT 100 METERS AWAY WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED, AND, UNFORTUNATELY,\nTHE TWO SUSPECTS ARE U.S.  CITIZENS.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WERE IN THE\nAREA AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.  THIS IS AN OFFICIAL REPORT; THIS\nIS WHAT TOOK PLACE IN LA CEIBA.  THE TWO SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED, AND THEY\nMUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE SEVEN WHO WERE WOUNDED, WHO ARE AT THE (WORD\nINDISTINCT) HOSPITAL.  WHAT YOU REPORTED OVER THE RADIO IS CORRECT.  THERE\nIS NO NEED TO BE ALARMED.  IT WAS A HOMEMADE BOMB, AND THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED\nBY THE SHRAPNEL, CEMENT, AND STONES THAT WERE THROWN INTO THE AIR BY THE\nEXPLOSION.  \n\n   HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO DENY A REPORT BY THE MILKMAN FROM (WORD\nINDISTINCT), WHO SAID THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN AND IS BEING HELD\nHOSTAGE.  THAT IS NOT TRUE.  WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, (WORDS INDISTINCT)\nTHE PATROLS WERE ALREADY ON THE STREETS AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT.  FUSEP\n(THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCE) WAS INSTRUCTED TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS, AND\nTHEREFORE VEHICLES ENTERING OR LEAVING LA CEIBA WERE STOPPED AND SEARCHED.\nTHAT IS ALL; STANDSTILL MERELY BECAUSE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nWOUNDED, OR BECAUSE TWO OR THREE ARE CRITICALLY WOUNDED.\n\n   THE CITY MUST FUNCTION NORMALLY.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE INTERESTED IN THE\nCONTINUATION OF PRODUCTION.  SO THE MAN FROM (WORD INDISTINCT) WHO CALLED\nAND SAID THAT HE WAS LOSING 100,000 LEMPIRAS (AS A RESULT OF THE VEHICLE\nSEARCHES) THIS MORNING WAS TELLING A LIE.  WE GAVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS\nTHAT THE INSPECTION OF VEHICLES SHOULD BE CARRIED UNTIL 0500, AND THAT THE\nVEHICLES SHOULD NOT BE DETAINED.\n\n   (REPORTER) COLONEL, IT WAS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PRESIDENT WHO PROVIDED\nTHE REPORT AND SAID THAT THE DELIVERY OF MILK HAD BEEN STOPPED.\n\n   (SANCHEZ) WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR HIM -- WHOM I DO NOT KNOW PERSONALLY\n-- I MUST SAY THAT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT WE ARE STOPPING VEHICLES (AS HEARD).\nWE STOPPED A VERY SMALL WHITE VAN WITH SOME LABORERS IN IT TO SEARCH THE\nVAN.  I WAS THERE ON THE HIGHWAY.  THERE WAS NO MILK ON THAT BUS; THERE\nWERE PEOPLE ON THAT BUS, AND I MYSELF ALLOWED THEM TO CONTINUE.  I AM\nSORRY THAT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS BEEN MISINFORMED.  WE ARE NOT\nPARALYZING ACTIVITIES, NOR ARE WE HOLDING THE CITY HOSTAGE.  AS I SAID, WE\nARE TRYING TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND WE HAVE ARRESTED TWO PEOPLE.\nWE ARE NOT SURE IF THEY WERE THE ONES WHO PERPETRATED THE ATTACK; WE ARE\nNOT SURE OF ANYTHING.  WE ARE MERELY CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND TAKING\nPREVENTIVE MEASURES.\n\n   (REPORTER) COLONEL, ARE THE TWO MEN YOU HAVE IN CUSTODY THE SAME U.S.\nCITIZENS YOU MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS REPORT?\n\n   (SANCHEZ) YES.  THE LIEUTENANT IN CHARGE OF THE PATROL (WORDS INDISTINCT)\nTHE PANTS, CLOTHES, AND THE COLOR OF WHAT THEY WERE WEARING INDICATED THAT\nTHEY WERE CIVILIANS.  LIEUTENANT SALGADO OF THE 4TH BATTALION WAS 50 METERS\nAWAY WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED.  TWO PERSONS WERE CAPTURED.  HOWEVER, THEY\nHAVE DENIED THAT EITHER OF THEM WAS INVOLVED.  THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  WE\nHAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES FOR THE ARMED FORCES INVESTIGATIVE\nPERSONNEL TO ARRIVE TO LEARN THE IDENTITIES OF THE TWO MEN WHO ARE BEING\nHELD.  THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE COMPLETELY PROFESSIONAL.  WE (WORDS\nINDISTINCT) TWO OR THREE PERSONS WERE INJURED.  WE ARE NOT PARALYZING\nPRODUCTION; I WANT TO MADE THIS CLEAR.\n\n   (REPORTER) YES, OF COURSE.  COLONEL, GIVEN THE SITUATION, DO YOU BELIEVE\nTHAT THE SITUATION IN THE ARMED FORCES IS COMPLETELY NORMAL?\n\n   (SANCHEZ) OF COURSE IT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL.  WE ARE NOT RESTRICTING\nANYONE'S FREEDOM.  WHEN IT GETS DARK, WE WILL PROCEED TO ASK FOR\nIDENTIFICATION PAPERS; WE WILL STOP AND CHECK VEHICLES, WHICH IS NORMAL IN\nTHIS TYPE OF SITUATION.  HOWEVER, AT NO TIME WILL WE PARALYZE PRODUCTION OR\nNORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES.  WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE CULPRITS RESPONSIBLE FOR\nTHIS ATTACK.  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST U.S.  CITIZENS,\nIT WAS CERTAINLY AN ATTACK AGAINST PEACE AND ORDER.  WE THEREFORE HAVE TO\nINVESTIGATE IT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT INVOLVED U.S.  CITIZENS.  IN\nTHIS CASE, AND IN VIEW OF THIS SITUATION, I PERSONALLY ISSUED ORDERS AND\nFOLLOWED THE INVESTIGATION UNTIL 0500, WHEN I SUSPENDED ALL OPERATIONS.  I\nPERSONALLY ORDERED THESE MEASURES.  I AM AMAZED THAT THE CATTLEMEN DO NOT\nTRANSPORT MILK BEFORE 0500.\n\n   (REPORTER) ONE LAST QUESTION ON THIS MATTER:  IS THE SITUATION IN LA\nCEIBA RELATED TO THE LATEST VIOLENT INCIDENTS IN SAN PEDRO SULA?\n\n   (SANCHEZ) I BELIEVE SO.  A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS HAS BEEN LAUNCHED\nAGAINST SOCIAL PEACE IN HONDURAS.  THIS STATION'S LISTENERS AND LISTENERS OF\nALL OTHER HONDURAN RADIO STATIONS KNOW THE HIGH - CALIBER OF THE ARMED\nFORCES PERSONNEL, BEGINNING WITH THE TOP COMMANDERS AND CONTINUING WITH\nOFFICERS DOWN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.  WE ARE SENSITIVE TO SOCIAL ISSES AND\nARE NOT MOTIVATED BY VESTED INTERESTS OF ANY KIND.  I BELIEVE THAT THESE\nACTS OF BLOODSHED, WHICH ARE (WORDS INDISTINCT), ARE PART OF A SERIES OF\nFULLY PLANNED, COLDLY CALULATED ACTIONS.\n\n   I DO NOT WANT TO SOUND LIKE A COMIC STRIP CHARACTER, BUT I BELIEVE THAT\nTHESE ACTIONS ARE CONNECTED AND OVERLAP.  I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT (WORDS\nINDISTINCT).  WE ARE WITNESSING THE EMERGENCE OF THE SO-CALLED WHITE HANDS\nAND BLACK HANDS (DEATH SQUADS), WHICH CONCERN US VERY MUCH.

WE\nWILL BE CONTACTING YOU DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO LEARN THE RESULTS OF THE\nINVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS HOMEMADE BOMB ATTACK IN LA CEIBA.\n\n   (SANCHEZ) WE ARE COMPLETELY AT YOUR SERVICE.

TODAY WE WILL\nDISCUSS THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM.  THIS SUBJECT COULD PERHAPS SEEM A\nBIT OUT PLACE AT A TIME WHEN MORE TROUBLESOME MATTERS AFFECT ALL\nARGENTINE FAMILIES, SUCH AS HIGH PUBLIC UTILITY RATES, PRICES,\nCONTROLS, DIFFICULTIES, ETC.  HOWEVER, WE MUST ATTEND TO THE FOREIGN\nDEBT PROBLEM BECAUSE MOST OUR DIFFICULTIES COME FROM IT.\n\n   OF WHAT DOES THIS PROBLEM CONSIST?  WE CURRENTLY OWE $64 BILLION.  THIS\nREPRESENTS A BURDEN OF $6 BILLION YEARLY IN INTEREST PAYMENTS.  SINCE\nARGENTINA IS CURRENTLY EXPORTING $9 BILLION ANNUALLY, AND IF WE PAID $6\nBILLION IN INTEREST, WE WOULD ONLY HAVE $3 BILLION LEFT ANNUALLY TO ATTEND\nTO ALL OUR NATIONAL NEEDS, THAT IS, THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY, COMMERCE, ETC.\n\n   OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY, AND WE CANNOT PAY $6 BILLION IN\nINTEREST EACH YEAR WITH $9 BILLION WORTH OF ANNUAL EXPORTS.\n\n   THIS IS NOT NEW.  THIS IS A HEAVY INHERITANCE, WHICH ORIGINATED NOT IN\nTHE RECENT PAST BUT MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO.  WHEN MARTINEZ DE HOZ BECAME\nECONOMY MINISTER (MARCH 1976), THE FOREIGN DEBT AMOUNTED TO $9 BILLION.\nWHEN HE CONCLUDED HIS TERM, THE DEBT AMOUNTED TO $29 BILLION.  THE\nMILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT CAME AFTER HIM DRAGGED THE DEBT ALONG AND\nINCREASED IT TO $44 BILLION WHICH THEY PASSED TO PRESIDENT ALFONSIN.\nALFONSIN'S ADMINISTRATION INCREASED THE DEBT BY AN ADDITIONAL $20 BILLION.\nSO TODAY OUR DEBT AMOUNTS TO $64 BILLION.\n\n   THIS IS NOT ALL.  WE CEASED HONORING OUR COMMITMENTS ABROAD.  WE HAVE NOT\nEVEN PAID INTEREST SINCE APRIL LAST YEAR.  WE HAVE ONLY MADE TOKEN\nPAYMENTS.  THIS REFUTES THE IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SAY: LET US STOP PAYING OUR\nDEBT AND USE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GROW.  WE ARE NOT PAYING\nANYTHING.\n\n   FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ANYTHING, AND NOT ONLY HAS\nTHE ECONOMY NOT GROWN, BUT IT SHRANK.\n\n   ARGENTINA HAS AN EXTREMELY LOW CREDIT RATING.  COUNTRIES ARE\nINTERNATIONALLY CLASSIFIED BY THEIR CREDIT, AND WE ARE IN ONE OF THE LOWEST\nCATEGORIES.  OUR COMMERCIAL CREDIT IS ALSO BEING CURTAILED.  COMMERCIAL\nCREDITS ARE THE ONES THAT ALLOW US TO IMPORT, EXPORT, AND MEET OUR DAILY\nNEEDS.\n\n   WHEN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ASSUMED POWER ON 8 APRIL 1989, THE CENTRAL\nBANK'S FOREIGN RESERVES WERE EXHAUSTED.  THIS SITUATION CAN TURN INTO A\nCRISIS AT ANY MOMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE LIKE THIS.\n\n   THE COMING OF THIS NEW GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BROUGHT ABOUT POSITIVE\nEXPECTATIONS AND HOPE, AND WHICH IS UNDERTAKING REMARKABLE CHANGES -- MAINLY\nCHANGES OF MENTALITY -- HAS STOPPED THE CRISIS FROM EXPLODING.  BUT WE\nCANNOT REST ON OUR ACHIEVEMENTS.  WE MUST FACE THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY.\n\n   OUR STARTING POINT IN CERTAINLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.  OUR COUNTRY HAS NO\nPRESTIGE ABROAD; WE HAVE LOST OUR CREDIBILITY.  NO ONE EVEN WANTS TO HEAR\nABOUT ARGENTINA, OR AT LEAST ABOUT ITS DEBT.  IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE\nNOT HONORED ANY OF OUR COMMIETMENTS.  EVERY TIME WE SIGNED A LETTER OF\nINTENT WITH THE IMF, WE KNEW THAT WE COULD NOT COMPLY WITH IT.  THERE HAVE\nBEEN SEVERAL LETTERS OF INTENT WE DID NOT COMPLY WITH.\n\n   WHAT POLICY WILL WE FOLLOW IN THE FUTURE?  THE PRESIDENT DEFINED IT IN\nHIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS ON 8 JULY.  HE SAID WE HAVE A HEAVY BURDEN, A DEBT\nTHAT WAS UNWISELY CONTRACTED, BUT IT IS A COMMITMENT OF HONOR.  HE USED\nWORDS THAT WERE COMMON IN ARGENTINA IN THE PAST.  \n\n   IT WAS ONCE SAID: WE WILL COMPLY WITH OUR COMMITMENTS, EVEN AT THE COST\nOF HUNGER AND THIRST FOR THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS\nOWN COMMITMENT ON THIS SUBJECT.  WE WILL PAY ACCORDING TO THE CAPABILITY OF\nTHE NATION, AND THE ONLY THING WE REQUIRE IS A BIT OF TIME AND, OF COURSE,\nFLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF OUR CREDITORS.\n\n   IF WE DID NOT HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS, IF WE HAD SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO\nPAY, THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY WORSE.  WE WOULD BE\nISOLATED.  WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CREDITS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO\nOBTAIN FOREIGN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  IN A WORD, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO\nINTEGRATE THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH IS QUICKLY EXPANDING AND\nPROGRESSING.  WE WOULD BE MUCH MORE BACKWARD THAN WE ARE TODAY.  THEREFORE\nTHERE IS REALLY NO QUESTION OF PAYING OR NOT PAYING.  THE HONOR OF THE\nCOUNTRY IS AT STAKE.\n\n   WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE FOREIGN DEBT IN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY?  YOU KNOW\nTHAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY.  WE HAVE NATURAL RESOURCES, FOOD, ENERGY,\nFISHING, MINING, ETC.  WE HAVE HUMAN RESOURCES.  YOU KNOW THAT WHEN\nARGENTINES WORK ABROAD THEY ARE EFFICIENT AND THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH.\nWE HAVE NO INTERNAL RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, OR INDIAN PROBLEMS, NOT EVEN PROBLEMS\nWITH OUR NEIGHBORS.\n\n   WHAT ARE WE MISSING?  WHY ARE WE WHERE WE ARE, AND WHY CAN'T WE SURVIVE?\nWE NEED TWO THINGS: FIRST, WE NEED AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC ORDER.  WE LIVE\nIN A DEEP ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISORDER.  SECOND, WE NEED CAPITAL.  CAPITAL\nIS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.\n\n   I SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO DISCUSS THE SAVINGS IN ARGENTINA THAT CAN BE\nTAPPED.  FOR YEARS, ARGENTINA'S SAVINGS HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY PUNISHED BY\nGOVERNMENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS ABUSIVE TAXES, MANDATORY SAVINGS, AND, ABOVE\nALL, THE GREAT EROSION CAUSED BY INFLATION THAT DESTROYS THE CURRENCY.  JUST\nREMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE CHANGED OUR CURRENCY.  TO PROTECT THEMSELVES\nFROM THESE LOSSES, WHAT DID SAVERS DO?  THEY EITHER TOOK THEIR MONEY ABROAD\nOR HID IT UNDER THEIR MATTRESSES.  WE WILL FOCUS TODAY ON THE MONEY UNDER THE\nMATTRESSES, ALTHOUGH WHAT I WILL SAY NOW WILL ALSO BE RELEVANT FOR THOSE WHO\nHAVE THEIR SAVINGS ABROAD.  ACCORDING TO CALCULATIONS, THERE ARE SMALL,\nMEDIUM, AND LARGE SAVINGS ADDING UP TO NEARLY $5 BILLION IN THE COUNTRY.  A\nPERSON WAS ASSAULTED IN CORDOBA THE OTHER DAY AND $250,000 WAS FOUND IN HIS\nMATTRESS.  MONEY UNDER THE MATTRESS IS AT RISK, DOES NOT ACCRUE INTEREST,\nDOES NOT WORK FOR THE COUNTRY, AND DOES NOT GIVE ANY BENEFIT TO THE OWNERS\nNOR THE COUNTRY.\n\n   SOME OF OUR HOPE LIES IN THESE SAVINGS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY,\nBECAUSE THEY REPRESENT A RESERVE THAT WE HAVE ON HAND.  WE ARE NOT\nBANKRUPT.  WE HAVE THOSE RESERVES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT WORKING.  THE\nSECRET IS TO USE THEM FOR THE COUNTRY'S BENEFIT.  ARGENTINA'S PROBLEMS CAN\nBE RESOLVED IF THESE SAVINGS ARE USED.  NOW, TO TAP INTO THESE SAVINGS, THE\nGOVERNMENT HAS MADE A DECISION, AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAS ALREADY TRANSLATED\nIT INTO A RESOLUTION.  INTO BANKS HERE IN THE COUNTRY IN DOLLARS, YEN,\nDEUTSCHE MARKS, OR ANY OTHER CURRENCY.  THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE\nWITHDRAWALS WHENEVER THEY WANT IN THE SAME CURRENCY IN WHICH THEIR SAVINGS\nWERE DEPOSITED.  NOBODY WILL BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THEM.  THIS WILL BE\nREINFORCED BY A LAW GRANTING SAVERS THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE THAT NO PUBLIC\nPOWER CAN INTERVENE IN THOSE SAVINGS; THAT IS, THERE WILL BE A FINANCIAL\nSYSTEM INTO WHICH THOSE SAVINGS, IN ANY CURRENCY, CAN BE PLACED FOR THE\nBENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND, OF COURSE, THE DEPOSITOR.  ANYBODY WHO HAS\n$10,000 UNDER HIS MATTRESS CAN TAKE IT OUT, GO TO THE BANK, AND, UNDER THE\nGUARANTEE OF THE BANK -- NOT THE CENTRAL BANK OR THE NATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN\nDISCREDITED -- THE MONEY WILL BE AT HIS DISPOSAL AT ANY TIME.  THE BANK WILL\nLEND THE MONEY FOR EXPORT OPERATIONS AND FOR MOVING THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH.\nNEW BLOOD WILL THUS HAVE BEEN INJECTED INTO THE ARGENTINE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.\n\n   I POINT OUT THAT THE LAW WILL GIVE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES. NO PUBLIC POWER\nWILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEIZE THE SAVINGS, NOR FREEZE THEM, NOR POSTPONE\nTHEIR WITHDRAWAL.  THESE ARE THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES THAT CAN BE GIVEN; MORE\nIS IMPOSSIBLE.  EACH ARGENTINE MUST NOW THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS.  IT HAS\nA CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE, BECAUSE IT INJECTS BLOOD INTO THE SOCIAL BODY; IT\nMOVES THE COUNTRY.  MOREOVER, FROM THE MORAL STANDPOINT, IF WE DO NOT DO\nTHIS, HOW CAN WE GO ABROAD AND ASK FOREIGNERS TO INVEST IN ARGENTINA -- TO\nBRING THEIR MONEY TO ARGENTINA -- IF AT THE SAME TIME I DO NOT INVEST HERE\nBECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY COUNTRY? THIS IS AN IMMORAL POSITION.\n\n   IF WE MAKE THE INITIAL EFFORT AND DEPOSIT $2, 3 OR 4 BILLION IN THE\nCOUNTRY, OUR NEGOTIATIONS ABROAD TAKE A NEW TWIST, BECAUSE WE CAN SAY THAT\nTHE ARGENTINES HAVE MADE THE FIRST EFFORT.  ALL THIS NATURALLY DEPENDS ON\nCONFIDENCE, AND CONFIDENCE IN TURN DEPENDS ON TAKING THIS FIRST STEP.  THIS\nIS A RECIPROCAL EFFECT.  TO CREATE CONFIDENCE, MEASURES SUCH AS THOSE\nADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAVE TO BE ADOPTED.  THESE\nMEASURES CREATE CONFIDENCE, AND WITH CONFIDENCE THE COUNTRY WILL QUICKLY\nRECOVER.  WE HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS, BUT WITHIN THE\nLIMITATION OF TIME, WE CAN STOP HERE.", "dateline": "BUENOS AIRES, 28 JUL 89 (ARGENTINA TELEVISORA COLOR NETWORK)", "char_before": 580466, "source": "INTEL TEXT PROC", "char_end": 589171}

I AM DELIVERING A\nSUMMARY OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS IN WRITING, AS ESTABLISH BY THE CONSTITUTION,\nFOR THE USE OF THE LEGISLATORS. IT IS A SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENTS.\n\n   IT IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT TO ME TO SAY THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE\nGOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE TO REAFFIRM THE SYSTEM OF\nDEMOCRATIC FREEDOM, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SYSTEM PERU HAS. WITH THIS\nFREEDOM, EVEN THE MOST EXTREME POSITIONS CAN EXIST. THE REACTIONARY\nPOSITIONS OF THE ULTRARIGHT AND RADICAL IDEOLOGIES CAN ALSO LIVE IN FREEDOM.\nVIOLENCE HAS LESS CHANCE OF DEVELOPING IN FREEDOM.  THE NATION HAS MORE\nLEGITIMATE MEANS TO ERADICATE VIOLENCE UNDER FREEDOM.\n\n   LIKE ANY OTHER CITIZEN, I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SOMETIMES DISAGREEMENTS,\nPOLITICAL PARTIES, LAWS, AND SKILLFUL LEGAL PROCEDURES CAN OBSTRUCT MANY\nTHINGS AND STOP DECISIONS. BUT THIS IS THE PRICE FOR A CIVILIZED LIFESTYLE.\nDEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE THE FORTHRIGHTNESS OF A DICTATORSHIP. DEMOCRACY IS\nSLOWER, BUT DEMANDS MORE FIRMNESS, MORE CONVICTION, MORE PATIENCE. DEMOCRACY\nDEMANDS THE GRADUAL EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE; THIS TAKES A LONG TIME. I AM\nSAYING THIS BECAUSE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SUFFERING A DRAMATIC ECONOMIC\nCRISIS SINCE SEPTEMBER 1988, AND IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO MAKE HARSH CHANGES\nAT A TIME WHEN VIOLENCE HAS SEEMED TO INCREASE.\n\n   WE HEARD SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST THEIR COOL DEMANDING AN INTERRUPTION OF\nOUR DEMOCRACY. THEY CALLED FOR A SHORTER GOVERNMENT TERM. THEY ALSO SAID\nTHAT THE COUNTRY COULD DEFEAT THE TERRORIST VIOLENCE AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS\nBY RESTRICTING FREEDOM AND ESTABLISHING AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME.\n\n   I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WERE IMMATURE VOICES, DECEITFUL TEMPTATIONS. MANY OF\nTHOSE VOICES UNFORTUNATELY CAME FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE WEALTH. BY DOING\nTHIS THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE NOT YET READY TO COEXIST DEMOCRATICALLY\nAND TO ACCEPT THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TENSIONS, EVEN AT THE WORSE TIMES,\nSHOULD BE HANDLED WITH SERENITY AND PATIENCE. A DICTATORSHIP THAT VIOLATES\nLEGAL PROCEDURES WILL ONLY HELP TO INCREASE VIOLENCE AND LEGITIMATE\nINSURGENCY, AND WOULD STIMULATE THE CREATION OF NEW SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. A\nDICTATORSHIP CANNOT SOLVE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT WOULD ONLY HAVE LIMITED\nPOWER AND WOULD IMPOSE A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD LEAD NOWHERE.\n\n   I AM REFERRING TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE A CRUCIAL\nPERIOD. I CALL ON THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY\nBY REALIZING THAT IN A DEMOCRACY THE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED WITH MORE\nDEMOCRACY, WITH MORE FREEDOM, AND WITH MORE PARTICIPATION. TO HAVE\nDEMOCRACY, ONE MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF PATIENCE.\n\n   THIS IS MY LAST MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE\nPOLICY OF TRYING TO PREVENT VIOLENT PLANS BEFORE THEY ARE CARRIED OUT\nIS SOMETHING THAT HAS PRODUCED GOOD RESULTS.\n\n   OF COURSE, THE PEOPLE SUSPECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES OF SUPPORTING THE\nFMLN PLANS ARE ARRESTED AND TURNED OVER TO THE JUDGE ONCE THE EVIDENCE IS\nGATHERED.  I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT.  UNFORTUNATELY MANY\nOF THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED ARE LATER RELEASED.  MANY OF THEM TURN OUT TO BE\nINNOCENT BECAUSE SUSPICIONS MAY TURN OUT TO BE FALSE AND THE JUDGE IS THERE\nTO PREVENT MISTAKES FROM BEING COMMITTED.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES ARE\nACTING WITHIN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK.\n\n   THERE ARE CASES SUCH AS MR MASARIEGO.  WHEN HE WAS RELEASED, IT WAS\nCONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM, AND WE HAVE HERE\nDOCUMENTS PROVING THAT.  HOWEVER, HE TOURED THE UNITED STATES TO SHOW OFF\nHIS BURNT KNEE AND TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN TORTURED HERE IN EL SALVADOR.  IT\nHAD BEEN PROVEN THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS\nRELEASED.  THE LEFT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES\nABROAD.  HOWEVER, I DO NO BELIEVE THE LEFT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL.\n\n   (KOBERG) MR PRESIDENT, AN ANALYST WHO MET WITH US A SHORT TIME AGO GAVE\nHIS OPINION ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE AND ITS RESULTS.  HE WAS NOT\nVERY OPTIMISTIC AND HE SAID THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL POINTS THAT COULD BECOME\nOBSTACLES TO THE DIALOGUE.  ONE OF THEM WAS THE ECONOMIC MEASURES.  HE SAID\nTHAT THE FMLN COULD NOT HOLD NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AS LONG AS THE\nGOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THE ECONOMIC MEASURES IT WAS IMPLEMENTING.  WE HAVE\nLEARNED FROM THE FMLN COMMUNIQUES, WHICH ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO KEEP\nIMPLEMENTING THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS AND OTHER SERIES OF POINTS\nCONCERNING THE ECONOMIC MEASURES.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, WITHIN THIS\nFRAMEWORK, WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATE OR WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT\nUNDERSTAND BY NEGOTIATION?  COULD THERE BE POSSIBLE NEGOTIATION ON THE\nECONOMIC POLICY?\n\n   (CRISTIANI) I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HERE IN OUR COUNTRY NO LONGER\nHAS THAT GENERIC MEANING GIVEN BY THE DICTIONARY.  THIS WORD HAS BEEN\nMANIPULATED BY LEFTIST FORCES IN THE SENSE THAT TO NEGOTIATE IS TO ACCEPT\nWHAT THE FMLN WANTS.  ACCORDING TO THE LEFT, THAT IS WHAT NEGOTIATING\nMEANS.  I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HAS A GENERIC MEANING.  A NEGOTIATION\nIS TO TRY TO FIND JOINT AGREEMENTS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND THAT IS WHAT WE\nHAVE BEEN PROPOSING.  WE HAVE SOUGHT AGREEMENTS ON THE LARGEST NUMBER OF\nPOINTS POSSIBLE.  LOGICALLY, NOT ALL POINTS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE OTHER\nSIDE AND WE BELIEVE THE FMLN IS MAKING A MISTAKE WHEN IT THINKS IT WILL\nNEGOTIATE ITS ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, OR SOCIAL PLATFORM WITH THE GOVERNMENT.\nTHE FMLN MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THEIR PLANS FOR THE\nCOUNTRY WITH THE PEOPLE.  THAT IS DONE BY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND BY SHOWING\nTHEIR PROPOSALS TO THE PUBLIC.  IF THE PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED THAT THEIR\nPROPOSALS ARE BEST, THEY WILL GET THE VOTES AND THEY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO\nIMPLEMENT THEIR PROGRAMS AND THEIR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS.\n\n   IN THIS CASE, UNFORTUNATELY THEY DID NOT PARTICIPATE; IT WAS OUR PARTY\nPLATFORM THAT WAS CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE.  THIS GIVES THE GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT\nTO IMPLEMENT WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ASK OF THEM.\n\n   WE DO NOT THINK THE FMLN SHOULD OPPOSE THIS OFFERING.  THE FMLN REFUSES\nTO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND KEEPS LOOKING FOR EXCUSES AND SETTING\nCONDITIONS, SUCH AS DEMANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECLARE ITSELF TEMPORARY\nBEFORE ANY TALKS ARE CONSIDERED.  THEY KNOW THEY ARE ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE.\nTHEIR TRUE PURPOSE IS TO REFUSE TO TALK SERIOUSLY, WHICH THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE WANTS THEM TO DO.  LORENA, I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD CONFUSE THE\nVARIOUS FACTORS INVOLVED.  HOLDING A DIALOGUE IS NOT EASY, AS POINTED OUT BY\nTHIS ANALYST, WHOSE NAME I DO NOT KNOW.  THE SITUATION IS NOT EASY TO\nRESOLVE.  THIS PROCESS COULD WELL LAST MANY MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS.  IT IS\nNECESSRY TO START NOW WITH A DIALOGUE IN WHICH BOTH SIDES BEGIN TO DISCUSS,\nNOT WHAT THEY CANNOT AGREE ON, BUT WHAT WE CAN AGREE ON.  WE SHOULD BEGIN BY\nTRYING TO ELIMINATE THE VIOLENCE THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY.  IF THEY FIND\nTHEY CANNOT AGREE ON SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD\nALSO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE STANCE.

ON SEVERAL OCASSIONS VENEZUELA HAD TO FACE\nRAIDS INTO ITS TERRITORY, AS WELL AS THE KIDNAPPING OF STOCKBREEDERS,\nSMUGGLING OF GOODS, AND DRUG TRAFFICKING BY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND\nCRIMINALS.

IF IN THE PAST LIBERALISM WAS A FACTOR THAT PROMOTED PROGRESS\nAND INDEPENDENCE IN LATIN AMERICA, NEO- LIBERALISM IS NOW THE STATE\nIDEOLOGY OF THE MORE POWERFUL NATIONS.  IT IS AN AUTHORITARIAN\nIDEOLOGY THAT DOES NOT QUESTION ALL TYPES OF STATES, BUT ONLY THE\nSTATES OF THE SOUTH.  UNDER THE GUISE OF ELIMINATING BUREAUCRACY AND\nPROMOTING EFFICIENCY, NEO-LIBERALISM WANTS TO DESTROY THE STATE TO\nELIMINATE ANY RESISTANCE TO THE HEGEMONY OF THE WORLD MARKET.\n\n   WE SHOULD NOT PLAY THAT GAME.  IDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT SHOULD\nTHEREFORE REDEFINE THE STATE AND DEFEND ITS STRENGTH IN OUR COUNTRIES.\n\n   WHEN I SAY STATE I AM NOT REFERRING MERELY TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES\nTHAT EVERY ONE OF US REPRESENTS.  I AM REFERRING TO AN ACCORD THAT OUR\nSTATES SHOULD REACH IN EACH REGION.  WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE\nUNITED IN CONTINENTAL BLOCS.  WE MUST PROMOTE OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY.\n\n   ONLY THROUGH REGIONAL INITIATIVES WILL WE HAVE POWER IN THE CURRENT\nPROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING THE MARKET.  IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO\nCALL -- IN EACH CONTINENT -- MORE FREQUENT AND REGULAR MEETINGS OF OUR\nMOVEMENT.  WE MUST ORGANIZE THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ON A CONTINENTAL\nBASIS TO STRENGTHEN IT IN ALL PLACES.\n\n   MANY HAVE COME TO THIS MEETING TO PROPOSE AN ADMINISTRATIVE\nSTRUCTURE FOR OUR MOVEMENT TO INSURE ITS CONTINUITY.  THIS CAN BE\nVIEWED AS A SUGGESTION.  IT IS A LOT MORE IMPORTANT, THOUGH, TO\nRECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND TO CREATE\nINTERMEDIATE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS WHEREVER POSSIBLE.\nTHESE INTERMEDIATE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE PRINCIPLES OF\nTHE MOVEMENT IN EACH REGION, THUS EXPANDING ITS POWER.\n\n   ALTHOUGH IT'S TAKEN SOMETIME, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY\nADOPTED THIS APPROACH IN LATIN AMERICA THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE\nPOLITICAL CONSULTATION MECHANISM OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH GIVES\nCOMMON ANSWERS TO THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND TO POLITICAL INTERVENTION.\n\n   MR PRESIDENT, IN HONORING OUR FOUNDERS -- TITO, NEHRU, AND NASSER\n-- I SHOULD STRESS THE ETHICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF NONALIGNMENT.  WITHOUT\nTHE POWER OF NUCLEAR BOMBS OR MONEY, WE HAVE UPHELD THE MORAL VALUES\nOF MANKIND TO HELP IT TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN ALL FIELDS.\n\n   THEREFORE, OUR MOVEMENT CANNOT REMAIN INDIFFERENT TO THE VERY\nSERIOUS PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ADDICTION, WHICH HAS\nSPREAD AROUND THE WORLD.\n\n   IT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS RICH\nCOUNTRIES, BECAUSE DRUG ADDICTION REFLECTS THE MOST REFINED STAGE OF\nCONSUMPTION, THE CONSUMPTION OF INSATISFACTION.  YET IT IS ALSO TRUE\nTHAT WE, AS DRUG PRODUCERS OR DEALERS, ARE INVOLUNTARY PARTNERS.  LIKE\nNEO- LIBERALISM, DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS PERVERSELY TRIED TO TAKE OVER.\n\n   DRUG TRAFFICKING IS ALSO A FORM OF HEGEMONY BY THE LARGE RICH\nMARKETS, WHICH ARE THEREBY DISTORTING AND CORRUPTING OUR SOCIETY.\nDRUG TRAFFICKING ALSO SEEKS TO DESTROY STATES, AS IT IS NOW DOING IN\nCOLOMBIA.\n\n   I BELIEVE WE SHOULD RAISE THE BANNER OF MANKIND'S MORAL VALUES; WE\nSHOULD TELL THE RICH THAT EVEN IF THEY IGNORE OUR CLAIMS FOR JUSTICE,\nWE WILL NOT IGNORE THEIR YOUTH AND THEIR CHILDREN, WHO MUST BE\nDEFENDED FROM DRUG ADDICTION.\n\n   THE U.S. PRESIDENT WILL FORMULATE A PROPOSAL ON THE SUBJECT\nTOMORROW, AND WE HOPE IT WILL BE AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING PROPOSAL.\n\n   THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST OVER HELICOPTERS AN AMMUNITION.  IT\nINVOLVES AN ACCORD BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, ON ONE SIDE,\nAND THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED ON THE OTHER.\n\n   THE PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, IN PARTICULAR, CALLS FOR STRUCTURAL\nTREATMENT, WITHOUT WHICH ANY MILITARY AID WILL BE INSUFFICIENT.\n\n   OUR MOVEMENT MUST ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND\nUNDERTAKE JOINT MEASURES TO ERADICATE IT.  THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT\nMUST ALSO ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT\nIS LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS IN PERU.\n\n   FAITHFUL TO ITS MORAL PRINCIPLES, THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT SHOULD\nSTRONGLY REJECT DRUG ADDICTION AND DEATH.  THIS WILL SHOW THAT OUR\nNATIONS' RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY IS AS STRONG AS THAT OF THE MOST\nDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.\n\n   MR PRESIDENT: WE CAME TO THIS SUMMIT FROM PERU TO REITERATE OUR\nFAITH IN NONALIGNMENT, OUR ANTI-IMPERIALIST POSITION AGAINST\nCOLONIALISM AND INTERVENTIONISM, AND OUR DECISION TO SIDE WITH THE\nNATIONS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND JUSTICE.

LAST\nYEAR, THIS FIGURE DROPPED BY OVER 1/3, WHICH MEANS THAT 9 MILLION U.S.\nCITIZENS HAVE CEASED BEING OCCASIONAL DRUG USERS.  ALTHOUGH THE\nOVERALL COCAINE USAGE HAS DROPPED, THE FREQUENT USE OF COCAINE HAS\nALMOST DOUBLED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.  THESE ARE THE CASUAL COCAINE\nUSERS, THOSE WHO CONSUME CRACK, AND WHO REPRESENT THE MOST SERIOUS AND\nURGENT PROBLEM.

IF YOU DECIDE TO\nGO FAIRLY CLOSE THE GUARDS WILL OPEN FIRE WITHOUR WARNING.  I WAS ALSO\nABLE TO SEE A NINETEENTH-CENTURY CASTLE, A RARE AND EXTREMELY\nBEAUTIFUL BUILDING, A GENUINE ARCHITECTURAL MONUMENT.

SOME INFORMATION ON ITS HISTORY, IF YOU COULD.\n\n   (ISAYEV) BY RIGHTS THE FOUNDER OF THE CARTEL IS CONSIDERED TO BE\nCARLOS ENRIQUE LEHDER, WHO WAS ABLE TO UNITE THE COCAINE MAFIA OF\nCOLOMBIA AROUND HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTIES.  A FEW WORDS\nABOUT LEHDER HIMSELF: HE IS A DESPERATE EXTREMIST WHO HOLDS NOTHING\nSACRED.  HE HAS HUNDREDS OF HUMAN LIVES ON HIS CONSCIENCE.  IT IS NOT\nFOR NOTHING THAT HIS FRIENDS GAVE HIM AT VARIOUS TIMES THE NICK NAMES\nRUM ROBIN HOOD, THE DRUGS BARON, AND SO ON.  CARLOS LEHDER IS\nDISTINGUISHED FOR HIS AUDACITY AND A RESTLESS DISPOSITION.  TOGETHER\nWITH HIM OTHER COLOMBIAN FAMILIES HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN THIS\nADVANTAGEOUS BUSINESS, NAMELY THE OCHOA AND ESCOBAR FAMILIES.  AT THE\nEND OF THE EIGHTIES (AS HEARD) A COCAINE WAR BEGAN BETWEEN THESE THREE\nCLANS.  LATER, HOWEVER, THEY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT AND THE MEDELLIN\nCARTEL WAS FORMED\n\n   (VEDENYAPIN) IN THE PRESS MANY REPORTS HAVE APPEARED STATING THAT\nLITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE CARTEL.\nIS THIS TRUE?\n\n   (ISAYEV) THE CARTEL'S ANNUAL INCOME, AS THE PRESS CLAIMS, IS $8\nBILLION.  TO SKETCH THE SCALE OF COCAINE OPERATIONS I WILL REMIND YOU\nTHAT IN 1984, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CARTEL BIGWIGS PROPOSED TO THE\nGOVERNMENT TO CLEAR COLOMBIA'S ENTIRE FOREIGN DEBT WITHIN A WEEK --\nAND I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THIS IS $9 BILLION -- IF THE GOVERNMENT\nWOULD RELEASE MAFIA MEMBERS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED.  NOT VERY LONG AGO\nA WEST GERMAN MAGAZINE PUBLISHED A LIST OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE\nWORLD AND ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL -- JORGE OCHOA -- IS\nBY NO MEANS LAST ON THAT LIST.  I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION ANOTHER CASE\nTHAT CHARACTERIZES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DRUG MAFIA'S MEANS. FOUR\nYEARS AGO IT CAME TO LIGHT THAT THE CARTEL HAD TAKEN PART IN\nNEGOTIATIONS ON BUYING A WHOLE CONSIGNMENT OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES,\nSEVERAL MILITARY HELICOPTERS, AND OTHER MODERN WEAPONS.\n\n   (VEDENYAPIN) HOW IS THIS LETHAL ARSENAL USED?\n\n   (ISAYEV) IT IS COMPLETELY NATURAL THAT THE CARTEL COULD NOT EXIST\nWITHOUT A COMPLETE ARMY OF MERCENARY KILLERS AND INFORMANTS WHO HAVE\nPENETRATED INTO LITERALLY ALL SPHERES OF THE COLOMBIAN ECONOMY,\nPARLIAMENT, AND THE ARMY.  THE MAIN TARGET OF THE MAFIOSI ARE\nPROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS, WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THREATEN THE DRUGS\nBUSINESS.  I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THE SAME CARLOS LEHDER IN 1984\nORGANIZED THE ASSASSINATION OF LARA BONILLA, THE COLOMBIAN MINISTER OF\nJUSTICE.  IN 1986 GUILLERMO CANO, THE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRESSIVE\nNEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR WAS MURDERED, AND IT WAS BASICALLY AFTER THIS\nMUDER THAT THE HUNT FOR LEHDER BEGAN.  IN THE SAME YEAR HE WAS\nARRESTED AND HANDED OVER TO U.S. JUSTICE, WHICH SENTENCED HIM TO LIFE\nIMPRISONMENT.  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE EXISTS AN AGREEMENT\nBETWEEN THE U.S. AND COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENTS ON THE EXTRADITION OF\nESPECIALLY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS.\n\n   (VEDENYAPIN) IF WE TAKE THE PRESENT WAR -- IT CANNOT BE CALLED\nANYTHING ELSE -- WHAT WERE ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSES?

WHAT COULD YOU\nTELL US ABOUT THIS?\n\n   (ASTURIAS) I BELIEVE THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO\nBE CLARIFIED. AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER, THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND MADE A\nNEW PROPOSAL AIMED AT FINDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE INTERNAL\nARMED CONFLICT OUR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING. THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A\nPOLITICAL SOLUTION AND TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AS A FIRST STEP TO\nCREATE THE CONDITIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ENTAILS AN\nINCREASED EFFORT IN THE STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY. WE DO NOT THINK OF\nDIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION AS A DEMOBILIZATION ELEMENT BUT AS AN\nEXTREMELY ACTIVE ELEMENT, AS A CLARIFYING ELEMENT, TO FIND AND PUT IN\nPLACE CONSENSUS WITH DEMOCRATIC SOLUTIONS. THIS IS WHY ALTHOUGH THERE\nHAS BEEN, IN FACT, AN INCREASE OF REPRESSION -- WHICH BY THE WAY, IT\nWAS BRUTALLY INTENSIFIED LAST MONTH -- THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A\nPOLITICAL SOLUTION AND THE CALL ALL NATIONAL SECTORS, WITHOUT\nEXCEPTION, TO BEGIN CONTACTS, TALKS, AND DIALOGUE WITH THE UNRG\nDESPITE THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO REFUSE THEM AND\nCONTINUES MAINTAINING A CLOSED POSITION.

THE MAIN PROBLEM THE COUNTRY HAS AND HAS HAD IN THE LAST FEW\nYEARS IS THE LACK OF RESPECT TOWARD HUMAN RIGHTS, THE MILITARIZATION\nOF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIETY, AND THE GENERALIZED OPPRESSION EXPERIENCED.\nTHEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THE MAIN POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE\nAGENDA IS THE DEMOCRATIZATION.\n\n   (REPORTER) SPEAKING OF THE INTERNAL SITUATION FROM THE MILITARY\nPOINT OF VIEW, NEWS AGENCY REPORT EVERY DAY OF MISSING PERSONS,\nKILLINGS, AND TORTURES.

THEY ARE ARMY OPERATIVE\nGROUPS THAT ACT BASED ON INFORMATION, CHARGES, SUSPICIONS, OR MANY\nTIMES BLINDLY TO SEE WHAT INFORMATION THEY CAN FIND, IN WHAT WAY THEY\nCAN HIT OR INFILTRATE THE PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT.

BESIDES,\nTHE SOVIET POLICIES OF PERESTROYKA AND GLASNOST HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY\nMODIFIED NOT ONLY THE COMMUNIST IDEAS BUT ALSO THE FUTURE WORLD\nPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SCENE.\n\n   THESE TRANSFORMATIONS ARE ATTRACTIVE FOR THE INDUSTRIALIZED\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THEY PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EASTERN EUROPE AND\nPROBABLY REDUCE EUROPEAN INTEREST IN LATIN AMERICA. BESIDES, THE\nUNITED STATES AND CANADA ARE PERMANENTLY MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD THEIR\nSOCIOECONOMIC INTEGRATION.\n\n   WE STAND BEFORE A DIFFERENT WORLD WHICH IS OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES\nWHICH MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, BUT WHICH ALSO CREATES DIFFICULTIES\nFOR WHICH WE MUST BE PREPARED.  LATIN AMERICA SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS\nSITUATION AND POLICIES IN FACE OF THE RAPID WORLD CHANGES. WE MUST\nANALYZE THE WAY IN WHICH WE WILL INTEGRATE AND HARMONIZE OUR ECONOMIES\nIN THIS NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SCENE.\n\n   IN FACE OF THESE EVENTS, WE MUST REDEFINE OUR INTEGRATION FORMULAS\nAND OUR DEVELOPMENT MODELS. I SUGGEST THAT A WORK GROUP BE FORMED TO\nSTUDY THIS SUBJECT AND TO ADOPT SPECIFIC MEASURES LEADING TO THE\nECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS OF LATIN AMERICA IN THIS NEW WORLD THAT\nIS BEING BORN.\n\n   MY DEAR PRESIDENTS AND FRIENDS, THIS NEW MEETING OF THE GROUP OF\nEIGHT MUST MAKE US STRENGTHEN OUR SOLIDARITY IN FACE OF THE THREATS\nAGAINST DEMOCRACY AND OUR SOCIAL PROGRESS. WE MUST STRENGTHEN THE\nREGIONAL COOPERATION MECHANISM AND OUR NEGOTIATED CAPACITY THROUGH THE\nIMPLEMENTATION OF AN EFFICIENT STRATEGY OF CONSENSUS TO MAKE OUR\nPROPOSALS MORE SOLID.\n\n   WE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT ARE UNITED BY UNDENIABLE\nHISTORIC TIES OF FRIENDSHIP. WE ARE ALSO UNITED BY STRATEGIC,\nPOLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS WHICH MUST BE COORDINATED TO BE ABLE\nTO SUCCESSFULLY FACE THE CHALLENGES OF TOMORROW.\n\n   AS I RECENTLY TOLD MY VENEZUELAN COUNTERPART, UNITY CAN BE SOLIDLY\nBUILT ON FEASIBLE INITIATIVES RATHER THAN ON WORDS. INTEGRATION\nTHRIVES ON ACHIEVEMENT THAT IN PRACTICE BRING PEOPLES TOGETHER AND\nALLOW THEM TO ENJOY THE RESULTS OF PROGRESS OBTAINED THROUGH COMMON\nEFFORT. YEARS OF STRUGGLE FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT HAVE SHOWN US THAT\nDEVELOPMENT MUST BE BASED ON ACTIONS THAT WILL GENERATE CONFIDENCE AND\nWELL-BEING, CONTRIBUTE TO NATURALLY COMPLEMENTARY ACTIONS, AND SOLVE\nSMALL AND LARGE PROBLEMS.\n\n   COLOMBIA IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE STRENGTHENING THE MECHANISM OF\nCONSENSUS BY ENDORSING THE SUGGESTIONS I HAVE MADE AND THOSE THAT WILL\nSPRING FROM THIS SUMMIT MEETING.

IS IT\nBECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS PREVAILING IN EACH COUNTRY?\n\n   (GARCIA) WE HAVE A COMMON STANCE.  NO COUNTRY CAN PAY WHAT IT IS\nBEING ASKED TO PAY.  WE ALL KNOW THIS.  PEOPLE KNOW IT.  THE LABOR\nUNIONS KNOW IT.  THEREFORE, THAT IS OUR STANCE.\n\n   A FEW YEARS AGO SOME COUNTRIES MADE AN EFFORT TO PAY.  NOWADAY,\nEVERYBODY KNOWS THEY CANNOT PAY AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO CHANGE THE\nPAYMENT CONDITIONS.  THIS IS THE BASIC ISSUE THAT WE ALL SHARE.\n\n   THE FACT THAT SOME COUNTRIES RESORT TO THE BRADY PLAN, THAT OTHERS\nSEEK OTHER ALTERNATIVES, OR THAT OTHERS CHOOSE NOT TO PAY A DEBT THAT\nTHEY CONSIDER TO BE UNFAIR -- AT LEAT UNTIL CONDITIONS CHANGE OR\nPAYMENTS ARE REDUCED -- ARE SIMPLY DIFFERENT SHADES OF A COMMON\nSTANCE.  THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT WE ARE GRADUALLY VERIFYING THAT\nNO COUNTRY IS ABLE TO PAY THE DEBT IN CONTRACTED, A DEBT THAT HAS\nGROWN ONLY BECAUSE OF INTERESTS.\n\n   I WILL REITERATE SOME DRAMATIC BUT REALISTIC FIGURES: 10 YEARS AGO\nLATIN AMERICA OWED $190 BILLION.  IT PAID $289 BILLION TO DECEMBER\n1988 -- THAT IS 10 YEARS -- AND IT STILL OWES $430 BILLION.  IN THE\nPAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA HAS REDUCED ITS PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION\nDRAMATICALLY BY 2 TO 3 PERCENT A YEAR.  IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN\nAMERICA REDUCED ITS IMPORTS, SEEKING TO SPEND LESS DOLLARS.  IT\nINCREASED ITS EXPORTS AND DEVALUED ITS CURRENCIES TO OBTAIN DOLLARS\nWITH WHICH TO PAY THE DEBT.\n\n   IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA GREW ONLY 1 PERCENT PER YEAR,\nAND IT HAS USED THAT 1 PERCENT, PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 4-PERCENT OF ITS\nGNP, TO PAY THE DEBT.\n\n   THEREFORE, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, 10 YEARS LATER WE FIND THAT WE\nOWE MORE, PRODUCE LESS, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY OUR DEBT.  WE ALL\nKNOW THIS.  IT HAS COST US 10 YEARS TO UNDERSTAND IT.  HOWEVER IT IS\nAN EXPERIENCE THAT CONSTITUTES THE BASE FOR OUR COMMON STANCE.\n\n   (REPORTER) HAS PROGRESS BEEN MADE IN THIS FIELD SINCE THE PUNTA DEL\nESTE SUMMIT?\n\n   (GARCIA) WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN A BRADY PLAN IF WE HAD NOT MET IN\nACAPULCO OR IN PUNTA DEL ESTE?  ONE OF JAMES BRADY'S ADVISERS\nPUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES STATING THAT THE BRADY PLAN\nWAS ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER 1985 TO PREVENT THE DISSEMINATION OF THE\nPERUVIAN ATTITUDE OF UNILATERALLY REDUCING ITS DEBT PAYMENTS.\n\n   WHO KNOWS IF THE ACAPULCO AND PUNTA DEL ESTE MEETINGS HAVE NOT LED\nTHE CREDITORS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DEBT IS NOT WORTH ITS FACE VALUE\nAND THAT IT MUST BE REDUCED?\n\n   THEREFORE, THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS.  WHO KNOWS IF NEXT YEAR WE WILL\nBE SPEAKING OF REDUCING THE DEBT BY 50 PERCENT AND NOT JUST THE 20\nPERCENT THAT WE NOW SEEK?\n\n   YOU SEE, THE FACT IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE UNABLE TO PAY AND THAT WE\nARE NEGOTIATING TO PAY LESS, BUT THE CREDITORS ALSO KNOW THAT THEY\nWILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT THEIR MONEY IF THEY INSIST ON THEIR\nCLAIMS.\n\n   THEREFORE, IF THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION ARE HEADING TO\nWARD DISARMAMENT, WHY CAN'T THERE BE A FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT BETWEEN\nTHE RICH AND POOR?  I THINK THAT ECONOMIC TRENDS WILL FOLLOW THIS\nLINE.\n\n   (REPORTER) PRESIDENT, WHY HASN'T PANAMA BEEN DEFINITIVELY EXPELLED\nFROM THIS GROUP, AND WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT EXPAND?\n\n   (GARCIA) PANAMA AS A COUNTRY, INDEPENDENT OF ITS PAST\nADMINISTRATIONS, WAS A FOUNDER MEMBER OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT.  NO\nCOUNTRY CAN BE EXPELLED.  THIS IS A TERM THAT WOULD OFFEND THE\nCITIZENRY OF A COUNTRY.  WE SIMPLY RATIFIED THE SUSPENSION OF PANAMA\nINDEFINITELY UNTIL PANAMA IS GOVERNED BY A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED\nGOVERNMENT.  THAT WAS OUR DECISION.\n\n   (REPORTER) (PASSAGE INDISTINCT) THE OAS?\n\n   (GARCIA) WE ARE PREPARING A PROPOSAL IN WHICH WE STATE THAT THE OAS\nIS AN IMPORTANT FORUM OR MECHANISM FOR HEMISPHERIC DIALOGUE BUT WHICH\nMUST INCLUDE THE PRESENCE OF CUBA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH ARE YET\nNOT MEMBERS.\n\n   (REPORTER) WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT EXPAND?\n\n   (GARCIA) I HOPE SO.  THIS IS THE LAST YEAR IN WHICH I WILL ATTEND A\nMEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH I HELPED TO CREATE.  HOWEVER, I\nHOPE THIS GROUP WILL LEAD ANNUAL AND PERIODICAL MEETINGS OF ALL LATIN\nAMERICA PRESIDENTS.  I HAVE MAINTAINED THIS HOPE SINCE 1985.  I HOPE\nTHAT LATIN AMERICA WILL ANNUALLY COORDINATE SOME KIND OF COLLEGIAL\nEXECUTIVE BRANCH TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS.  THE GROUP OF EIGHT IS\nTHE BEGINNING OF THIS, AND I AM SURE THAT IT WILL EXPAND IN THE\nFUTURE.\n\n   HOWEVER, AT A CONTINENTAL LEVEL, THE ISSUES CANNOT RUN AS FAST AS\nFOR A COUNTRY, A PEOPLE, OR A POLITICAL PROCESS.  A CONTINENT REQUIRES\nMUCH LONGER TERMS AND WE MUST BE PATIENT.  LET US GO TO ANOTHER\nSUBJECT NOW.\n\n   (REPORTER) HUMAN RIGHTS.  TWO OF THE MAIN ISSUES IN LATIN AMERICAN\nLIFE ARE DEMOCRATIZATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  PRESIDENT MENEM HAS\nRECENTLY PARDONED MILITARY OFFICERS AND TERRORISTS WHO WERE SERVING\nPRISON SENTENCES.  THERE IS ALSO A CONFLICTIVE SITUATION IN PERU\nREGARDING SOME MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE BEING TRIED FOR MURDERS\nCOMMITTED IN JAILS.  ARE YOU WILLING TO PARDON THOSE MILITARY OFFICERS\nTO PACIFY THE SITUATION?  THIS IS MY FIRST QUESTION.\n\n   SECOND, THE PERUVIAN IMAGE THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA IS VERY\nBAD BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INFORMATION.  IN CONTRAST WITH ACAPULCO AND\nPUNTA DEL ESTE, WHICH ARE HOLIDAY RESORTS WITH MULTIMILLION DOLLAR\nINFRASTRUCTURES, THE CITY OF ICA REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF LATIN\nAMERICAN CITIES.

THROUGH THESE TRANSMISSIONS, THOSE PEOPLE\nRECEIVED THE MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AN ENCOURAGEMENT SENT BY THE PEOPLES\nOF THE WORLD.\n\n   THE FIRST BROADCASTS WERE MADE IN THOSE YEARS, AND VERY FEW HAVE\nNOT LISTENED TO THEM AT SOME TIME, ALTHOUGH NOBODY ADMITTED TO\nKNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PROGRAMS.  THE TYRANT HIMSELF VIOLENTLY ATTACKED\nTHE PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL PUBLIC SPEECHES.  NOT LONG AGO, PINOCHET'S\nFOREIGN MINISTER AGAIN SCATHINGLY REFERRED TO RADIO MOSCOW'S\nBROADCASTS.  THAT IS TO SAY THAT THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE CONTINUED TO\nAFFECT THE DICTATORSHIP IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THAT THEY HAVE\nHELPED THE RESURGENCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES.  THE RESURGENCE AND\nORGANIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES THROUGH THE IMPETUS OF THE\nWORKERS AND BROAD SECTORS OF THE POPULATION HAVE RESHAPED THE CHILEAN\nPOLITICAL SITUATION, TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE NOW APPROACHING THE REAL\nPOSSIBILITY OF AN ELECTORAL TRIUMPH BY A SINGLE OPPOSITION CANDIDATE\nTO THE PRESIDENCY, THUS SETTING THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION IN MOTION.\n\n   IN FACT THE SITUATION NOT ONLY HAS CHANGED IN CHILE, BUT ALSO IN\nTHE SOVIET UNION WHERE THE PERESTROYKA -- A REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS\nINSIDE A REVOLUTION -- HAS OPENED IMMENSE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE\nECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOVIET SOCIETY.  WE\nFREQUENTLY KEEP YOU ABREAST OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROGRAMS OF\nRADIO MOSCOW.  SO, ALL THIS HAS GALVANIZED OUR DISPOSITION TO CONTINUE\nCOOPERATING IN THIS PROCES THAT HAS REACHED NEW LEVELS.\n\n   OUR PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE OPEN AND AT THE DISPOSAL OF ALL ADVANCE\nFORCES THAT MARCH WITH THE DEMOCRATS.  A FEW WEEKS AGO, RADIO MOSCOW\nCOMPLETED 16 YEARS OF BROADCAST TO CHILE.  NOW, ON 29 OCTOBER RADIO\nMOSCOW WILL CELEBRATE ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY.  ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE\nWORLD KNOW THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW IN 81 LANGUAGES.  THE PROGRAMS\nTO CHILE HAVE A PRIVILEGED PLACE AMONG THEM.  FOR THE OCCASION,\nGREETINGS HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW AND RADIO\nMAGALLANES.  FROM CHILEANS SCATTERED IN 40 COUNTRIES BY THE FASCIST\nEXPLOSION, RADIO MOSCOW ALSO RECEIVES MAIL AND POSTCARD WITH MESSAGES\nOF APPRECIATION AND THANKS.  THIS IS A MODEST WAY OF RESPONDING TO THE\nVALUABLE ASSISTANCE RADIO MOSCOW HAS GIVEN, IS GIVING, AND WILL\nCONTINUE TO GIVE US.\n\n   WE HAD BEEN LEFT ALONE, ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD, AND RADIO MOSCOW\nPROVED TO BE OUR FRIEND DURING SHAMEFUL TIMES.

LOGICALLY, I CANNOT SAY THAT THEIR'S IS A\nSERIOUS POSITION BECAUSE WHEN A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS ARE PUT FORWARD, A\nPERIOD OF TIME IS REQUIRED TO ANALYZE THEM.  HOWEVER, THE FMLN\nIMMEDIATELY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL, SAYING THAT IT WOULD\nNOT ACCEPT IT.  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?  THAT THE FMLN NO LONGER WANTS TO\nTALK ABOUT THE END OF THE HOSTILITIES, BUT WANTS TO INTRODUCE NEW\nTOPICS AT THE SAN JOSE MEETING.\n\n   HOWEVER, DESPITE THE FMLN'S POSITION, AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAS NOT\nBEEN AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF ALL THE DOCUMENTS, ONE CAN SEE AT FIRST\nGLANCE THAT THE PROPOSALS THEY HAVE PUT FORWARD ARE TOTALLY ABSURD.  I\nWILL CITE AN EXAMPLE: YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE FMLN HAS ADMITTED TO\nBEING UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A POSITION, THAT IF IT ATTEMPTS TO OCCUPY A\nTOWN, IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS THE ARMED FORCES DRIVE IT OUT.  IT CANNOT\nMAINTAIN A POSITION IN THE COUNTRY.  NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN PROPOSAL\nATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH TERRITORIAL LIMITS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.\n\n   WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE FMLN EXISTS AND IS A REALITY, I BELIEVE\nTHAT REALITY HAS A DIMENSION, A SIZE.  THE RESULTS OF THE PAST\nELECTIONS, THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING OVER 3 PERCENT (WON BY THE\nDEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE), INDICATE THAT THE FMLN IS A REALITY BUT A\nVERY SMALL ONE, AND THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORCE A\nGOVERNMENT AND A PEOPLE TO VIOLATE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.\n\n   MEANWHILE, THE FMLN HAS COME UP WITH THE TOTALLY ABSURD NOTION THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT MUST DISMISS THE ENTIRE (MILITARY) CLASS OF '66, THE\nDEFENSE MINISTER, AND THE COMMANDER OF THE AIR FORCE.  THAT IS TOTALLY\nABSURD, IT IS A RIDICULOUS POSITION THAT DOES NOT TRULY SHOW ANY\nINTENTION TO MOVEMENT TOWARD PEACE.  THE FMLN PROPOSAL ALSO CALLS FOR\nTHE GOVERNMENT TO INSTRUCT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO CHANGE ALL OF\nTHE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.  THESE, SALVADORAN FRIENDS, ARE TOTALLY\nABSURD POSITIONS; ALTHOUGH THESE ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT, THEIR\nPREVIOUS POSITIONS ARE EVER PRESENT.\n\n   THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT AT ANY TIME VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION, IT\nWILL NEVER QUESTION THE SACRIFICES THAT YOU AND ALL THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE HAVE MADE DURING THESE LONG YEARS IN ORDER TO GRADUALLY\nSTRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WHICH MAY NOT BE PERFECT -- AND WE\nWOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS DIFFERENT WAYS OF PERFECTING IT -- BUT WE WILL\nNEVER SELL IT OR SACRIFICE IT, ESPECIALLY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH,\nBY ALL MEANS, ARE ABSURD.\n\n   WHAT IS WORSE, HOWEVER, IS THAT ALONG WITH THE ATTITUDE THE FMLN\nHAS DISPLAYED IN COSTA RICA, ALONG WITH ITS REJECTION OF EVERYTHING\nTHE GOVERNMENT SAYS, ITS ATTEMPTS TO MODIFY THE AGENDA WE HAD AGREED\nUPON IN MEXICO, ITS EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE A SERIES OF DOCUMENTS, AND\nITS DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE ANSWERS, IT HAS INITIATED A STRATEGY OF\nMURDERS HERE IN EL SALVADOR.  EVERYONE HAS NOTICED; THEY MURDERED A\nREPORTER'S WIFE AND SON.  WHY?  BECAUSE THEY HAD A RELATIVE IN THE\nARMED FORCES.  THEY HAVE MURDERED AN INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL, AT A SAFE\nDISTANCE, IN A COWARDLY MANNER, ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS A RELATIVE OF\n AN ARMED FORCES MEMBER.  YESTERDAY THEY ATTEMPTED TO MURDER A FORMER\nMILITARY MAN WHO ALSO HAS A RELATIVE IN THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n   WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN?  THAT THE FMLN INTENDS TO TALK OVER\nTHERE (COSTA RICA) AND TO MAKE AN ENTIRE CASE OUT OF ITS DEFENDING\nHUMAN RIGHTS, WHILE MURDERING PEOPLE AND VIOLATING THE HUMAN RIGHTS\nTHEY CLAIM TO BE DEFENDING, ON A DAILY BASIS.  ALL OF THESE FMLN\nATTITUDES FORCE US TO DIALOGUE, AND AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING, I MUST\nBE COMPLETELY CLEAR AND OPEN.  I MUST TELL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THE\nTRUTH.\n\n   I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR THE FMLN HAS NOT DISPLAYED THE POLITICAL\nRESOLVE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  FIRST OF ALL, THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT TO\nTALK ABOUT ENDING THE CONFLICT, IT DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE THE ENTIRE\nCOUNTRY -- YOU AND I, MY DEAR VIEWERS -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP\nLIVING IN THIS WHIRLPOOL OF VIOLENCE, TO LIVE IN PEACE, AND TO ALLOW\nTHE PROCESS TO PROGRESS IN THE SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS THAT WILL\nGRADUALLY GIVE US FIRM AND LASTING PEACE, WITHIN AN ATMOSPHERE OF\nTRANQUILITY.\n\n   THE FMLN'S ATTITUDE IS ONE OF PROVOCATION.  IT WANTS TO PROVOKE THE\nGOVERNMENT INTO GETTING UP FROM THE DIALOGUE TABLE; IT HAS TRIED TO\nANGER THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION BY INSULTING THEM.  ALL IN ALL,\nTHE FMLN IS TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO DESIST.  WHY ARE THEY\nSEEKING THIS?

THEREFORE, WE CAN NO LONGER THINK AT THIS MOMENT, THAT\nTHE FMLN HAS ONLY VIEWED THE DIALOGUE FROM A STRATEGIC POINT OF VIEW.\n\n   HOWEVER, WE WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.

WE ARE BECOMING MORE AND\nMORE AWARE OF THE VARIOUS POSITIONS, AND THERE IS LESS ROOM TO PLAY\nSTRATEGIC GAMES WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.\n\n   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY SUBJECT IN THIS\nDIALOGUE PROCESS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST DO THIS IN AN ORDERLY MANNER.\nWHEN WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, SUCH AGREEMENTS MUST BE RESPECTED.  THAT\nIS THE ATTITUDE THAT SHOULD PREVAIL IF THERE IS A TRUE POLITICAL\nDESIRE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  THEREFORE, ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO CONCLUDE MY\nMESSAGE BY MAKING AN APPEAL FOR UNITY.  WE MUST BE UNITED FOR PEACE.\nALL SECTORS -- POLITICAL, LABOR, RELIGIOUS, AND BUSINESS -- MUST\nDEMAND THAT THE FMLN SHOW A TRUE DESIRE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  WE MUST\nDEMAND THAT THE FMLN STOP TRYING TO USE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR FOR\nSTRATEGIC PURPOSES.  IF THE FMLN TRULY WANTS PEACE, WHY DOES IT\nCONTINUE TO SMUGGLE WEAPONS -- PROBABLY\n FROM NICARAGUA -- INTO EL SALVADOR.  TODAY, A TRUCK FROM NICARAGUA\nLOADED WITH WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES FOR THE FMLN WAS CONFISCATED AT THE\nBORDER WITH HONDURAS.  THIS SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS NOT YET SERIOUSLY\nSEARCHING FOR PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, THE UNITY OF THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD FORCE THE FMLN TO SEARCH FOR PEACE.  THE\nUNITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD CLOSE POLITICAL SPACE SO THE\n(FMLN) WILL STOP ITS STRATEGIC GAMES.  ALL OF US, UNITED, SHOULD\nDEMAND THAT THE FMLN TAKE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS SERIOUSLY, EQUALLY AS\nSERIOUSLY AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.

THAT IS, HOW\nMANY CONTRAS CAN BE DEMOBILIZED RIGHT AWAY, HOW MANY OF THEM WILL BE\nRETURNING TO NICARAGUA, HOW MANY WILL GO TO THIRD COUNTRIES.\nTHEREFORE, TO THE EXTENT THE PLAN IS BEING IMPLEMENTED, WE WILL BE\nWILLING TO REINSTATE THE CEASE-FIRE.\n\n   (REPORTER) MR PRESIDENT, UP UNTIL LAST WEEK, THE U.S. CONGRESS\nDISCUSSED GIVING MORE AID TO THE CONTRAS.  NO ONE EVEN WANTED TO TALK\nABOUT THE CONTRAS, IT WAS A STALE ISSUE.  HOWEVER, IT HAS BECOME A\nBURNING ISSUE OVERNIGHT AND EVERYBODY IS NOW TALKING ABOUT AID FOR THE\nCONTRAS AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING MILITARY AID TO THEM.  LAST\nNIGHT, THE U.S. SENATE ISSUED A RESOLUTION STRONGLY CONDENMING THE\nNICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT.  MY QUESTIONS ARE: FIRST, WHY HAS THERE BEEN\nSUCH A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE.  SECOND, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO\nTHE U.S. CONGRESS.\n\n   (ORTEGA) U.S. CONGRESSMEN ARE ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR\nREELECTION.  WITH THE DUE RESPECT THAT SOME OF THEM DESERVE, U.S.\nCONGRESSMEN ARE ONLY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR REELECTION.  I HAVE TALKED TO\nMANY OF THEM HERE AND THEY ARE CYNICAL.  THEY TELL ME: I DISAGREE WITH\nTHAT BUT I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO ELECTED ME.  IF THOSE WHO\nELECTED ME HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION, THEN I HAVE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT\nFOR THEIR VIEWPOINTS AND FORGET ABOUT MY OWN OPINION.  LET US NOT\nMISLEAD OURSELVES.  YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW U.S. CONGRESSMEN ACT.\nTHEREFORE, IT WAS EASIER FOR THEM TO SIMPLY APPROVE FUNDS FOR THE\nCONTRAS AS THEY HAD DONE -- BECAUSE THE CONGRESS HAD APPROVED THE\nSO-CALLED HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE CONTRAS (WORDS INDISTINCT) AND LET\nTHE WAR CONTINUE, AND LEAVE THE BURDEN ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nGOVERNMENTS, ESPECIALLY ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE WHO\nARE SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF THIS WAR.  THEREFORE, WE HAVE BEEN\nREPORTING THE KILLINGS, THE ASSASSINATIONS, THE CRIMES, THE CONTRAS\nATTACKS, AND THE YANKEE CONGRESS HAS REMAINED SILENT.\n\n   THEREFORE, WE SEE AN EASY-GOING ATTITUDE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS.\nOBVIOUSLY, WHEN WE ANNOUNCE WE ARE NOT GOING TO EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE\nTHE U.S. CONGRESS REACTS IMMEDIATELY.  THEY REACT BECAUSE THEY ARE\nFULLY AWARE THAT THEY ARE MEDDLING IN NICARAGUAN POLITICS.  THEY WILL\nHAVE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE, AND THEY DO NOT\nWANT TO DISCUSS THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AGAIN.  IT WAS EASY TO SET ASIDE\nTHE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AND TO SIMPLY APPROVE FUNDS FOR THE CONTRAS SO\nTHE CONTRAS COULD CONTINUE KILLING NICARAGUANS WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE\nREMAINS CALM -- LET THE PEACE PLAN CONTINUE AS FAR AS IT CAN AND AS\nFAR AS PRESIDENT BUSH ALLOWS IT TO DEVELOP.  THE U.S. CONGRESSMEN CAN\nTHEN FORGET ABOUT THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AND WORK ON OTHER DOMESTIC OR\nINTERNATIONAL ISSUES IN WHICH THEY ARE MORE INTERESTED.\n\n   HOWEVER, WHEN NICARAGUA SAYS: WE WILL NOT EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE,\nTHEN THEY RAISE AN OUTCRY.  WHY DO THEY RAISE AN OUTCRY?  BECAUSE THEY\nKNOW THEY WILL HAVE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE.\nMOREOVER, THERE MIGHT BE A FEVERISH CONGRESSMAN WHO WILL PROPOSE\nGIVING MILITARY AID TO THE CONTRAS.  WELL, LET THEM DISCUSS MILITARY\nAID.  DO THEY WANT TO DISCUSS MILITARY AID, WELL THAT IS THEIR\nPROBLEM.  WE SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE YANKEE CONGRESS ACTIONS\nWILL EASE OR HINDER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  THE DEVELOPMENT OF\nELECTIONS ON 25 FEBRUARY WILL DEPEND NOW ON THE YANKEE CONGRESS AND ON\nTHE YANKEE PRESIDENT.  IT WILL DEPEND ON THEM.  WE HAVE THE DESIRE TO\nDO IT.

THESE IRRATIONAL ACTIONS\nTHAT THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) HAS\nUNLEASHED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, AND PARTICULARLY AS OF YESTERDAY, MAKE\nIT NECESSARY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC TO TAKE ACTION, TO\nTAKE FIRM ACTION WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF OUR COUNTRY.\n\n   WE MUST ACCEPT THE PEOPLE'S MANDATE OF 19 MARCH, AND THE GOVERNMENT\nMUST NOW RESPOND WITH FIRM ACTION, WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK.

THE ARMED\nFORCES OF EL SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AND THEY HAVE\nCONTROLLED THE SITUATION.\n\n   HOWEVER, THESE FMLN TERRORISTS, WHO ALREADY FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN\nDEFEATED BY THE ARMED FORCES, ARE NOW BEGINNING TO CARRY OUT\nINDISCRIMINATE ACTS OF TERRORISM.  THEY ARE EVEN GOING AS FAR AS\nENTERING INNOCENT HOMES TO PRESSURE FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE\nTHROUGH THESE HARSH TIMES THAT ALL SALVADORANS HAVE EXPERIENCED.\n\n   THAT IS WHY WE MUST ACT FIRMLY BUT WITHIN THE LAW.  TO THIS EFFECT,\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MET AT 1400 IN THE\nPRESIDENTIAL HOUSE TO TRY TO SOLVE SOMETHING WE ARE COMPLETELY SURE IS\nWHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT.

FIRST, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, I WILL READ ARTICLE 29 OF THE\nCONSTITUTION, WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS:\n\n   ARTICLE 29.  IN CASES OF WAR, INVASION OF THE TERRITORY, REBELLION,\nSEDITION, CATASTROPHE, EPIDEMIC, OR OTHER GENERAL CALAMITY, OR IN\nCASES OF GRAVE DISRUPTION OF THE PUBLIC ORDER, THE GUARANTEES\nESTALISHED IN ARTICLES 5, ARTICLE 6, SUBPARAGRAPH 1, ARTICLE 7,\nSUBPARAGRAPH 1, AND ARTICLE 24 CAN BE SUSPENDED, EXCEPT WHEN REFERRING\nTO MEETINGS OR GROUPS FOR RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, AND SPORTS\nPURPOSES.  THE SUSPENSION CAN AFFECT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OR PART OF IT\nAND WILL BE DONE THROUGH A DECREE ISSUED BY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OR\nTHE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS APPROPRIATE.  THE GUARANTEES CONTAINED IN\nARTICLE 12, SUBPARAGRAPH 2, AND IN ARTICLE 13, SUBPARAGRAPH 2, OF THE\nCONSTITUTION CAN BE SUSPENDED, WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SO DECIDES\nBY A THREE-FOURTHS MAJORITY VOTE OF THE ELECTED DEPUTIES, BUT THE\nADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSION DETENCION ADMINISTRATIVA SHOULD NOT BE\nLONGER THAN 15 DAYS.\n\n   THE SUSPENSION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES WILL NOT EXCEED 30\nDAYS.  ONCE THIS PERIOD EXPIRES, THE SUSPENSION CAN BE EXTENDED FOR A\nSIMILAR PERIOD OF TIME, THROUGH A NEW DECREE, IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES\nTHAT LED TO IT CONTINUE.  IF THAT DECREE IS NOT ISSUED, THE SUSPENDED\nGUARANTEES WILL BE FULLY RESTORED.\n\n   AS YOU WILL SEE, THIS ARTICLE STATES THAT IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE\nBRANCH OR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS APPROPRIATE...  (CHANGES THOUGHT) FOR\nTHAT PURPOSE WE ACT BASED ON ARTICLE 167, NO.  6, WHICH READS: IT IS\nUP TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS TO SUSPEND AND RESTORE THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES MENTIONED IN ARTICLE 29 OF THIS CONSTITUTION\nIF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS NOT IN SESSION.

THE FASCIST NATURE OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S REGIME.

THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PREVENT OUR\nFORCES FROM ARMING AND GETTING SUPPLIES; THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO STOP OUR\nFMLN FORCES FROM ENTERING SAN SALVADOR, AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO\nSTOP OUR ADVANCE OR RECOVER A SINGLE INCH OF THE CITY OCCUPIED BY THE\nFMLN.

HOW CAN THERE STILL BE ANYONE LIKE\nTHE NICARAGUANS--AND I AM TALKING ABOUT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, OF\nCOURSE, NOT ALL NICARAGUANS--AND THE CUBANS, WHO SUPPORT SUCH ACTS OF\nSAVAGERY.\n\n   HOLDING CIVILIANS AS HOSTAGES, PUTTING THEM IN THE MIDDLE SO THAT\nTHEY WILL BE THE ONES WHO ARE HURT, AND SHIELDING THEMSELVES BEHIND\nINNOCENT PEOPLE IS AN ACT OF SAVAGERY, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.\n\n   TAKING OVER A CENTER FOR ORPHAN CHILDREN IN ORDER TO PROTECT\nTHEMSELVES BEHIND LITTLE CHILDREN WHO DO NOT HAVE A FATHER OR A MOTHER\nIS AN ACT OF SAVAGERY, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.\n\n   THEY EVEN DID SOMETHING WORSE AT THE ZACATECOLUCA HOSPITAL AND THE\nPEOPLE WITNESSED THIS. WHEN THEY ENTERED THE HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA,\nTHEY MURDERED, AT GUNPOINT, A SOLDIER WHO WAS RECEIVING MEDICAL\nATTENTION; THEY PLACED BOMBS INSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND THEN FLED.\n\n   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: THE FMLN IS ALREADY A DESPERATE BEAST. THIS IS\n THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY ABOUT SUCH IRRATIONAL MINDS. HOWEVER, WE\nMUST REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND, AND ABOVE ALL, BE SURE THAT THE\nMAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE REPUDIATE THE FMLN TERRORISTS.                    \n\n   THE PEOPLE MUST KNOW THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON THEIR ARMED FORCES\nWHICH HAVE ADVANCED SLOWLY, BUT SURELY. IT IS ADVANCING SLOWLY BECAUSE\nIT WANTS TO FULLY PROTECT THE LIVES OF CIVILIANS. THE ARMED FORCES\nCOULD DRIVE THOSE TERRORISTS OUT OF WHERE THEY ARE; HOWEVER, THERE ARE\nCIVILIANS THERE, AND WE WOULD NEVER WANT TO EXPOSE THOSE CIVILIANS TO\nTHE DANGER THE FMLN IS TRYING TO LEAD THEM INTO.  THE ARMED FORCES\nHAVE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE. THEY HAVE EFFECTIVELY ADVANCED, USING\nPROFESSIONAL MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE, NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS BOSQUES DEL RIO\nARE TOTALLY CALM NOW, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALREADY ENTERED\nAND FORCED THE TERRORISTS OUT. WE KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO\nSEE AN END TO THIS TERROR THAT THE FMLN WANTS TO CREATE.

(PASSAGE OMITTED)\n\n   (BEGIN RECORDING) (CASTRO) TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT DAY.  TODAY, WHEN\nWE ARE COMMEMORATING THE 470TH ANNIVERSARY OF HAVANA, WE RECEIVED THE\nNEWS OF THE CRUSHING TRIUMPH OF THE SOUTH-WEST AFRICAN PEOPLE'S\nORGANIZATION IN THE NAMIBIAN ELECTIONS BY 57 PERCENT. IT IS A VERY\nGOOD PERCENTAGE.\n\n   ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO RECEIVED THE NEWS....(REPHRASES) WE\nADMIRE THE HEROISM WITH WHICH THE SALVADORANS ARE FIGHTING.  IT IS\nSOMETHING VERY IMPRESSIVE.  IT IS A LIKE A LESSON TO IMPERIALISM WHICH\nIS EUPHORIC AND THINKS THAT THE WORLD IS AT ITS FEET. THEY THINK\nTHAT...\n\n   (SUAREZ, INTERRUPTING) (WORDS INDISTINCT) WHICH IS TERRIBLE.\n\n   (CASTRO) I BELIEVE THE ACTIONS THAT THE SALVADORANS ARE PRESENTLY\nCARRYING OUT ARE ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FEATS THAT HAVE EVER\nBEEN WRITTEN.  DESPITE THE 10 YEARS (OF STRUGGLE), THE\nBILLIONS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS INVESTED IN CREATING THE\nSALVADORAN ARMY AND SUPPLYING IT WITH THE MOST MODERN TYPES OF ARMS,\nNOTICE HOW THOSE PEOPLE CAN FIGHT.  NOTICE WHAT IS BEING DONE.  HOW\nARE THEY USING THE YANKEE BOMBS AND PLANES?  THEY ARE BEING USED TO\nMASSACRE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  JUST NOTICE HOW THEY ARE\nINDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING THE PEOPLE'S NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH ARE IN THE\nHANDS OF THE REVOLUTIONARIES.  WHAT THE IMPERIALISTS ARE DOING IS\nSOMETHING REPUGNANT.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT WHAT THE SALVADORANS ARE\nDOING IS AMAZING, ADMIRABLE.  WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS SHOWING THE\nIMPERIALISTS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE FAR FROM KNEELING BEFORE THEM.  THEIR\nACTIONS ARE SHOWING IMPERIALISM THAT THE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING\nWITHOUT CARING ABOUT THE EUPHORIA THAT CURRENTLY OVERCOMES THEM UNDER\nTHESE CIRCUMSTANCES.\n\n   (SUAREZ) COMMANDER, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY ON THE SUBJECT OF WHY WE\nHAVE SO MANY FRIENDS?  WE, THE CUBANS ARE WHAT WE ARE BECAUSE WE ARE A\nMIXTURE OF SPANISH AND AFRICAN.\n\n   (CASTRO) I THINK WE HAVE THE FRIENDS WE DO BECAUSE WE HAVE FOLLOWED\nA POLICY OF PRINCIPLE.  I THINK THE FRIENDS WE HAVE ARE BASICALLY DUE\nTO THE PRESTIGE OF THE REVOLUTION, THE RESPECT THE REVOLUTION MERITS,\nTHE ETHICS OF THE REVOLUTION, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REVOLUTION.\nNOW, THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALSO A MIXTURE OF CARIBBEANS, THAT IS\nSOMETHING ELSE.  THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS.  (WORD\nINDISTINCT) REASONS WE CAN HAVE CONGENIALITY.  HOWEVER, CONGENIALITY\nDOES NOT ALWAYS TURN INTO TRUE FRIENDSHIP.  THERE COULD BE\nCONGENIALITY BUT IT DOES NOT RESULT IN FRIENDSHIP.  FRIENDSHIP IS MORE\nA RESULT OF RECOGNITION, ADMIRATION FOR A COUNTRY.\n\n   (SUREZ) DO YOU BELIEVE THAT...\n\n   (CASTRO) THIS SMALL COUNTRY WAS FACING THE EMPIRE, IT BECAME A\nBASTION OF DIGNITY FOR THE WORLD.  I THINK THIS MERITS CERTAIN\nRECOGNITION AND LIKING. WE CAN BE PROUD OF THAT AND OF THE FRIENDS WE\nHAVE.  I APPRECIATE THESE FRIENDS WHO ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE\nYANKEE PRESSURES.  THEY ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE YANKEE THREATS,\nINTRIGUES, AND CAMPAIGNS.  THIS SAYS A LOT.  THE YANKEES WANTED TO\nBURY AND DISCREDIT THE REVOLUTION WITH THE MEDIA AGENCIES THEY OWN.\nHOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT.  THAT IS WHY UNDER\nTHESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FRIENDSHIP AND SOLIDARITY\nTHAT OTHER NATIONS RENDER US.  ASIDE, FROM THAT, WE ARE CARIBBEANS.\nWE ARE A GOOD MIXTURE.  WE ARE A MIXTURE OF WHICH WE ARE PROUD.  WE\nARE A MIXTURE OF INDIAN, AFRICAN, AND EUROPEAN.  THAT MIXTURE HAS\nTURNED OUT TO BE VERY GOOD.\n\n   (SUAREZ) WE ALSO HAVE CHINESE MIXTURE IN US.\n\n   (CASTRO) THAT IS TRUE, YOU ARE CORRECT IN REMINDING US OF IT.

THIS ABSURD MASSACRE AND THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS AGAINST HEAVILY\nPOPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY\nALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES' HIGH COMMAND, AND ARE PART OF\nA COUNTERINSURGENT PLAN TO DESTROY THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND CREATE\nA STATE OF TERROR AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  PUBLIC DEATH THREATS\nWERE MADE AGAINST PRIEST IGNACIO ELLACURIA OVER THE ARMED FORCES\nNATIONAL NETWORK.\n\n   THE NIGHT OF WEDNESDAY, 15 NOVEMBER, THE SECURITY CORPS SEARCHED\nTHE OFFICES OF THE OPPOSITION GROUPS LOOKING FOR THE LEADERS IN ORDER\nTO KILL THEM.  THIS IS THE SAME SCHEME THEY USED IN 1979 AND 1980 WHEN\nTHEY MURDERED MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND MASSACRED THE REVOLUTIONARY\nDEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, UNIVERSITY RECTOR DR FELIX ULLOA, AND TENS\nOF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.\n\n   3.  THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT THE ARENA (NATIONALIST\nREVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE) REGIME AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE\nFASCIST BEASTS THAT HAVE BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON\nDEMOCRATIC PEOPLES AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO PROTEST SUCH AN\nUNFORTUNATE MASSACRE, AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ISOLATE\nTHE FASCIST REGIME OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.\n\n   4.  WE CALL ON THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS WHO KNEW FATHER IGNACIO\nELLACURIA -- AND RESPECTED HIM FOR HIS PAST HISTORY IN THE FIELDS OF\nEDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE TRUE SITUATION --\nTO TAKE A DIGNIFIED AND DETERMINED STAND AND NOT STAIN THEIR HANDS\nWITH THE BLOOD OF GENOCIDE.\n\n   THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST PATRIOTS IN THE ARMED FORCES WHO DO\nNOT HAVE TO SINK WITH THE CRIMINALS.  WE OFFER THEM OUR HANDS, SO THAT\nTOGETHER WE WILL SAVE THE COUNTRY, AND SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE\nPART OF THE ARMED FORCES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES\nASSASSINATED THE JESUIT PRIESTS, BUT THEY ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE.\n\n   5.  THE FMLN CONDEMNS THIS CRIME AND JOINS IN THE SORROW OF THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO LOSE IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER SOME OF THE MOST\nAPPRECIATED INTELLECTUALS OF OUR COUNTRY.  THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND\nSENSIBILITY WERE ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS IN OUR\nSOCIETY.  THEIR WORK WILL BE ETERNAL, AND THE FASCIST IRRATIONALITY\nWILL NEVER PUT AN END TO THAT WORK.\n\n   WE CALL ALL OF OUR COMMANDS, FIGHTERS, MILITANTS, AND OUR PEOPLE IN\nGENERAL, TO UNTIRING COMBAT.  THIS STRUGGLE IS THE ONLY ANSWER WE HAVE\nFOR THIS DESPICABLE MASSACRE.  WE MUST OUST ARENA AND LA TANDONA (1966\nGRADUATING CLASS OF THE GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY SCHOOL).

THIS\nIS WHY THEY COMMITTED THIS CRIME.\n\n   THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME BECOMES EVIDENT, NOT ONLY BASED\nON DIRECT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THE FACT THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY\nUNIFORMED MEN DURING THE CURFEW PERIOD AND THAT A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE\nCRIME A GROUP OF MILITARY MEN CHECKED OUT THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE\nGOING TO COMMIT THE CRIME -- CLEARLY INTENDING TO PREPARE A PLAN --\nBUT BECAUSE OF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE JESUITS MADE OVER THE NATIONAL\nNETWORK.  WE MUST ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS CRIME WAS A POLITICAL\nMISTAKE MADE BY THE DICTATORSHIP.  IT WAS A MISCALCULATION ON THE PART\nOF THOSE WHO MADE THAT DECISION.\n\n   WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO\nSTOP THE FMLN.  THEY COULD NOT STOP THE FMLN PLAN.  ONCE WE BEGAN TO\nIMPLEMENT THE PLAN (1-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION) A VERY CRITICAL\nSITUATION.\n\n   WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS CRITICAL SITUATION, THEY TOOK THE\nWRONG STEP.  THE DAY BEFORE THE CRIME THE ARMED FORCES BEGAN A\nSTRATEGY TO WEAR OUT THE FMLN, LOGISTICALLY.  WE MUST NOT IGNORE THE\nFACT THAT THE ARMED FORCES' CALCULATIONS WERE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION\nTHAT THE FMLN FORCES WOULD BECOME EXHAUSTED.  WE WOULD HAVE MADE A\nSERIOUS MISTAKE IF WE HAD BEGUN THIS PLAN WITHOUT FORESEEING ALL THESE\nCIRCUMSTANCES.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES BASED THEIR CALCULATIONS ON\nOUR POSSIBLE EXHAUSTION.\n\n   CONSEQUENTLY, BASED ON THOSE CALCULATIONS, THEY FIGURED THAT THEY\nHAD 3 OR 4 DAYS TO LAUNCH A COUNTERATTACK.  SO, THE DAY PRIOR TO THE\nKILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEY LAUNCHED SEVERAL OFFENSIVES -- I\nRATHER CALL THEM COUNTEROFFENSIVES -- TO TRY TO DISLODGE US FROM OUR\nPOSITIONS.  THEIR TACTIC WAS TO MAKE US WASTE AMMUNITION.  THEY WERE\nNOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE US ABANDON OUR POSITIONS YET.\n\n   HOWEVER, OUR FIGHTERS, IN ADDITION TO SAVING OUR AMMUNITION, HAVE\nTHE MATERIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES SO THEY INFLICTED MANY CASUALTIES ON\nTHE ARMED FORCES AND WORE THEM OUT.  BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ARMED\nFORCES DID NOT REALIZE THAT AND FELT THAT THEY COULD LAUNCH A BIG\nCOUNTERATTACK TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN FORCES.  BASED ON THAT, THEY CAME\nUP WITH A PLAN THAT WAS NOT ONLY MILITARY BUT POLITICAL.  (WORDS\nINDISTINCT) THE U.S. AMBASSADOR, THE U.S. ADVISERS, THE BUSH\nADMINISTRATION, AND WHO KNOWS WHO ELSE WERE INFORMED ABOUT THIS PLAN.\nTHEY MADE THE WRONG INTERPRETATION OF THE CALLS MADE BY THE\nINTERNATIONAL RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS ON THE\nNEED TO HAVE A TRUCE TO EVACUATE CIVILIANS.  THEY THOUGHT THAT WE MADE\nTHESE CALLS AND BASED ON THAT, THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD PROCEED TO A\nCOUNTEROFFENSIVE.\n\n   BASED ON THAT, LET US ANALYZE THE PROPAGANDA AND INFORMATION\nDISSEMINATED ON THE DAY PRIOR TO THE KILLING OF THE JESUITS.  THE U.S.\nAMBASSADOR HIMSELF EXPLAINED A WAR REPORT AND GAVE AN UPDATE ON THE\nSITUATION.  THUS, THEY THOUGHT THAT THE FMLN WAS GOING TO SUFFER A\nGREAT POLITICAL AND MILITARY DEFEAT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  THEY HAD\nAN OVERALL PLAN.

APPARENTLY, EVERYONE HAD GONE INTO HIDING AND THEY ONLY\nFOUND THE WIFE OF A UNIVERSITY LEADER AND THEY KILLED HER.  THEY ALSO\nFOUND THE JESUITS.

(30-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION) THIS\nSITUATION SO THEY DID NOT PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THE FACE OF THE DANGER\nOF A POSSIBLE ACTION SUCH AS THIS CRIME.\n\n   ON THE SAME NIGHT WHEN THE ENTIRE NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AREA WAS\nBEING BOMBED, THE JESUITS WERE KILLED.

THEY\nTHOUGHT THAT BY KILLING ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS, THEY WERE GOING TO\nACHIEVE DEFINITE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  THIS IS VERY CLEAR.  BUT THIS\nACTION BACKFIRED.  IT WAS A PAINFUL INCIDENT, BUT IT IS AN INCIDENT\nTHAT IS GOING TO BACKFIRE FOR THE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS GOING TO RESULT\nIN GREAT ISOLATION FOR THE REGIME, AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN IS\nSTRONGER.  AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN HAS A POLITICAL, MILITARY, AND\nSTRATEGIC ADVANTAGE.\n\n   THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS IS SUICIDE FOR THE REGIME.  I REALLY DO\nNOT UNDERSTAND IT.  THEY MADE A VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE.  IN ADDITION,\nTHEY CONFIRMED A TRUTH WE HAVE BEEN MAINTAINING: THEY ARE FASCISTS AND\nASSASSINS.  THEY MUST LEAVE POWER.  THEY HAVE CREATED A SITUATION IN\nWHICH THE POSSIBILITY FOR AN FMLN VICTORY IS GREAT.

THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT\nARE TO SINK WITH THE CRISTIANI REGIME, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY MOVING\nTOWARD DEFEAT AND MILITARY AND POLITICAL DESTRUCTION DESPITE ALL THE\nPROPAGANDA IT HAS MADE, OR TO CHANGE ITS OPINION WHILE THERE IS STILL\nTIME.  THE ALTERNATIVE OF A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT, A REPLACEMENT OF\nCRISTIANI'S REGIME OR THE MILITARY HIERARCHY, IS ALREADY UNDER\nDISCUSSION.  THESE, THEREFORE, ARE THE TWO ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO\nTHE UNITED STATES: EITHER CHANGE ITS POLICY IN TIME AND REPLACE\nCRISTIANI, OR THE GOVERNMENT WILL SINK BECAUSE ITS PROPAGANDA IS NOT\nWORKING.\n\n   THE U.S. AMBASSADOR HAS MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF.  HE SAID THE\nGUERRILLAS HAD 1,500 MEN IN SAN SALVADOR, AND HE HAS LISTED CASUALTY\nFIGURES ACCORDING TO WHICH THE FMLN SUFFERED OVER 500 DEATHS, OVER 400\nWOUNDED, AND OTHERS CAPTURED.  ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES QUOTED BY THE\nU.S. AMBASSADOR, WHO PROVIDES GOVERNMENT WAR BULLETINS AND HAS ALMOST\nBECOME THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTER, THE FMLN ONLY HAS 200 MEN LEFT\nIN SAN SALVADOR.\n\n   WHAT I FIND INEXPLICABLE IS THE GOVERNMENT'S NEED TO USE 40 OR 50\nWAR PLANES AND HELICOPTERS, ALONG WITH ITS ARTILLERY AND ELITE\nBATTALIONS, TO BOMB AND DESTROY CITIES, ESPECIALLY SAN SALVADOR.  THAT\nIS WHY THEIR PROPAGANDA HAS BACKFIRED ON THEM.  IN THE UNITED STATES\nTHE PRESS AND GENERAL PUBLIC KNOW FULL WELL THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE IS\nIN FULL FORCE AND IS MOVING FORWARD, AND THAT THE U.S.  POLICY IS\nREACHING THE POINT OF TOTAL FAILURE.\n\n   (REPORTER) TO CONCLUDE, COMRADE SAMAYOA, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE ON\nRADIO VENCEREMOS TO THE COMRADES WHO HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR POSITIONS\nIN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND VARIOUS\nPOINTS OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY?

HE SAID THAT THESE SHOTS WERE\nFIRED FROM SOME DISTANCE, WITH A MACHINEGUN SET UP ON A TRIPOD.  THE\nPRIESTS WERE ALSO LATER SHOT IN A GARDEN NEARBY.  ACCORDING TO\nINFORMATION THAT THE SOCIETY OF JESUS RECEIVED FOLLOWING THEIR OWN\nRECONSTRUCTION OF THE CRIME, WHICH THEY HAVE RELEASED TO THE\nAUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING THE CASE, THE KILLERS, APPROXIMATELY 30 MEN\nIN UNIFORM, ARRIVED SHORTLY BEFORE 0230.  THEY MACHINEGUNNED THE HOUSE\nBEFORE ENTERING, DRAGGED THE PRIESTS OUT, PUT THEM IN FRONT OF A WALL\nTHAT IS STILL STAINED WITH BLOOD, AND SHOT THEM.  THE PRIESTS WERE\nALSO SHOT IN THE HEAD WITH A LONG-RANGE WEAPON; HOWEVER, THESE SHOTS\nWERE FIRED FROM SOME DISTANCE.  A LAWYER, HELPING IN THE INVESTIGATION\nOF THIS CASE AND WHO HAS ASKED TO REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, SAID THAT THIS\nWAS DETERMINED BECAUSE THERE WERE NO GUNPOWDER MARKS ON THE VICTIMS.\n\n   AT THE TIME THE CRIME WAS CARRIED OUT, A CURFEW WAS BEING OBSERVED\nTHROUGHOUT THE CITY.  (WORDS INDISTINCT) AND THE HOUSE WHERE THE\nPRIESTS LIVED WAS SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS.  TOGETHER WITH THIS\nINFORMATION, GATHERED BY SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROMINENT PERSONS TO\nPROVE THAT THE MURDER WAS CARRIED OUT BY SOLDIERS, WE MUST STRESS THAT\nTHE HOUSE WAS ALSO SEARCHED BY THE SOLDIERS 2 DAYS BEFORE THE CRIME\nWAS COMMITTED.  A JESUIT PRIEST WHO WAS DESCRIBING THE SCENE SAID THAT\nONLY THE AREA PREVIOUSLY SEARCHED BY THE SOLDIERS WAS DESTROYED.  HE\nSAID THAT THE LIBRARY WAS BURNED AND THE ROOMS HAD BEEN RANSACKED.\nACCORDING TO THE PRIEST, $5,000 THAT FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA HAD\nRECEIVED IN BARCELONA -- PART OF AN AWARD GIVEN THE UNIVERSITY -- WERE\nTAKEN FROM ONE OF THE ROOMS.\n\n   THE USE OF LONG-RANGE WEAPONS WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN WHY THE BRAINS OF\nTHE DEAD WERE SCATTERED ABOUT.  THIS WAS SEEN BY THE FIRST PERSONS WHO\nARRIVED ON THE SCENE.  OTHERS SAID THAT THE BODIES WERE DESTROYED\nBECAUSE AK-47 AND M-16 ASSAULT RIFLES WERE USED IN THE ATTACK.  THE\nBODIES WERE SO UTTERLY DESTROYED THAT EMBALMING WAS NOT POSSIBLE.\nTHIS WAS REPORTED TO ACAN-EFE BY SOCIETY OF JESUS SUPERIOR JOSE MARIA\nTOJEIRA.\n\n   REGARDING THE TWO MURDERED WOMEN, THE COOK ELBA JULIA RAMOS AND HER\n15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MARISELA, ALL INDICATES THAT THEY WERE\nMACHINEGUNNED IN THE SMALL ROOM WHERE THEY SLEPT. THERE WAS SO MUCH\nBLOOD THAT IT SEEPED UNDER THE DOOR, AND A VERTEBRA AND PIECES OF A\nSKULL CAN STILL BE SEEN UNDER A SOFA IN THE SMALL ROOM.  THE\nPRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE VICTIMS WERE NOT\nTORTURED AS EARLIER REPORTS HAD STATED.\n\n   MEANWHILE, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REPORTEDLY SAID\nYESTERDAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND HAS NOT RULED OUT THE\nPOSSIBILITY THAT THE KILLERS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS COULD HAVE BEEN\nSOLDIERS.  THEY HAVE NOT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOLDIERS COULD\nHAVE KILLED THE PRIESTS, AND THEY ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE\nINCIDENT AND PUNISH THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.  THIS WAS SAID BY THE\nSALVADORAN PRESIDENT IN STATEMENTS TO ACAN-EFE AND OTHER FOREIGN NEWS\nAGENCIES.  CRISTIANI, WHO INSISTED ON THE NEED TO AVOID UNFOUNDED\nCONCLUSIONS, ADDED THAT THE MILITARY DOES NOT THINK IT WILL BE\nAFFECTED BY SOMETHING DONE BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION.\n\n   WE CAN CLEARLY SEE NOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CONTRADICTIONS.  AT THIS\nMOMENT THERE ARE THREE POSITIONS.  THERE IS THE POSITION OF U.S.\nAMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER -- HE IS LIKE AN OSTRICH WITH ITS HEAD\nBURIED IN THE SAND.  THERE IS PROOF THAT RULES OUT ALL DOUBT.  HOW CAN\n40 MEN IN UNIFORM BE IN A MILITARIZED AREA FOR 60 MINUTES AND NOT HEAR\nSHOTS BEING FIRED AND BOMBS EXPLODING?  WHY DID THE ARMY NOT SEND IN\nTROOPS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED ONLY A FEW BLOCKS FROM COLONEL RENE\nEMILIO PONCE'S OFFICE?  THE 40 MEN WERE IN THE AREA FOR A WHOLE HOUR.\nTHEY HAD ALREADY SEARCHED FATHER ELLACURIA'S HOME.\n\n   OUR QUESTION FOR WILLIAM WALKER: IF THIS WAS NOT DONE BY THE ARMED\nFORCES, THEN WHY WERE THEY THERE SEARCHING THE PREMISES FOR A WHOLE\nHOUR AND EVEN STEALING $5,000?  THEY SEARCHED DRAWER BY DRAWER.  THE\nDISORDER THEY LEFT BEHIND WAS QUITE EVIDENT IN THE CLIPS SHOWN ON\nTELEVISION.  THEY SEARCHED THE AREA FOR AN HOUR TO SEE WHAT THEY, THE\nMURDERERS, COULD FIND TO STEAL.  HOWEVER, AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER\nSAYS THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IF THE ARMY COMMITTED THE CRIME.

IF IT IS TRUE THAT\nTHERE IS A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IN EL SALVADOR, THEN WHY CAN THE\nDEFENSE MINISTER APPEAR BEFORE THE TELEVISION CAMERAS CONTRADICTING\nCRISTIANI, GOING AGAINST WHAT CRISTIANI HAD SAID?  WHO GIVES THE\nORDERS HERE, LARIOS OR CRISTIANI?  IF CRISTIANI GIVES THE ORDERS, THEN\nTHE DEFENSE MINISTER MUST OBEY CRISTIANI AND REFRAIN FROM MAKING\nACCUSATIONS BEFORE A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION IS HELD.

THE GENERAL STAFF, THE SOLDIERS, ARE GAGGING THE PRESS,\nIMPOSING THE STATE OF SIEGE, GIVING THE FINAL ORDERS.  IT IS IMPORTANT\nTO LOOK INTO THIS CLOSELY BECAUSE GEN LARIOS, IN AN EMPTY SPEECH -- WE\nHEARD HIM DELIVER A RHETORICAL AND EMPTY SPEECH -- ACCUSED THE FMLN OF\nKILLING THE PRIESTS AND SAID THAT THE ARMY CONTROLS THE COUNTRY.  WE\nPOINT OUT THESE CONTRADICTIONS (WORDS INDISTINCT).\n\n   BY SAYING THAT THEY DID NOT DO IT, THAT THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT DO\nIT, THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADMITTED THAT HE DID IT, THAT HE IS ONE OF\nTHE KILLERS.

HE WILL PROBABLY PUT UP SOME\nACT.  THE U.S.  CONGRESS ALSO HAS ITS EYES ON EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE\nDEBATING THE ISSUE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR.  THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THE\nU.S.  CONGRESS MUST THINK ABOUT.  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SAID\nTHAT IT IS PLEASED WITH THE WAY CRISTIANI ACTED IN THE FACE OF THE\nFMLN OFFENSIVE.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS\nAPPROVED THE DROPPING OF WHITE PHOSPHORUS OVER ZACAMIL AND THE\nDESTRUCTION OF 500 HOMES.

UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT TAKE ONE STEP BACK.  ALL\nFOR PEACE.\n\n   WE HAVE BEEN READING THE SUMMARY OF OUR NEWS MONITORING.  U.S.  PENTAGON\nMILITARY OFFICIALS AND MANY NONMILITARY ANALYSTS ARE SURPRISED OVER WHAT\nTHEY CALL THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S OFFENSIVE\nCAPABILITIES.  A REPORT STATES THAT PENTAGON OFFICIALS ARE VERY SURPRISED\nOVER THE FMLN MANEUVERABILITY AND OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES.  THE FMLN ACTIONS\nOF THE PAST DAYS HAS SPOILED ALL THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SALVADORAN\nMILITARY MEN SENT TO U.S.  OFFICIALS CONTAINING INFORMATION ON THE FMLN\nMANPOWER-WEAPONS RATIO AND OUR MILITARY ABILITY TO OPERATE.\n\n   THE FMLN HAS NEVER LOST ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES.  SOME ANALYSTS VIEW\nTHE SALVADORAN WAR AS A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.  THAT IS A MISTAKE BECAUSE\nTHE SALVADORAN WAR IS NOT A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.  IT CANNOT BE VIEWED AS\nIF IT WERE A REGULAR WAR SUCH AS THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.  EL SALVADOR IS LIVING\nTHROUGH CONFLICT THAT IS MAINLY SOCIAL IN NATURE, A CONFLICT THAT IS ROOTED\nIN SOCIAL INJUSTICE.  THE FMLN DID NOT EMERGE FROM A MILITARY SCHOOL WITH A\nREARGUARD IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, BUT IT IS MADE UP OF THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES.\nFMLN COMBATANTS HAVE LEARNED TO FIGHT IN ACTUAL CLASHES.  THEY HAVE GAINED\nGROUND INCH BY INCH; IT HAS ORGANIZED THE PEOPLE.  THE FMLN DOES NOT\nFORCEFULLY RECRUIT PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, IT IS NOT PERIODICALLY RENEWING ITS\nRANKS AS THE ARMY DOES THROUGH FORCEFUL RECRUITMENT.  TO THE FMLN, THE MAIN\nGOAL IS TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE, TO GET AS CLOSE AS IT CAN TO THE PEOPLE.\n\n   BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, SOCIAL INJUSTICE, AND LACK OF DEMOCRATIC\nOPPORTUNITIES IN (EL) SALVADOR, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS HAVE NO OTHER\nOPTION THAN TO TAKE UP ARMS AND FIGHT TO ACHIEVE BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS IN\nTHE FACE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BRUTAL REPRESSION, ECONOMIC INJUSTICE, AND\nUNEMPLOYMENT.  TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS DECIDED TO\nTAKE UP ARMS AND LEARN TO WAGE WAR BY FIGHTING DAIILY.  THAT IS THE HISTORY\nOF THE FMLN.\n\n   THEREFORE, IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT TWO ARMIES ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.\nTHE LOGISTICS APPARATUS OF THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT' (ARMED) FORCES IS NOT\nCOMPARABLE TO OUR FORCES.  THEY BRING TO OUR COUNTRY TONS OF BOMBS, RIFLES,\nBOOTS, AND MATERIAL THROUGH PORTS AND MILITARY AIRPORTS.  ALTHOUGH THE\nGOVERNMENTS OF NICARAGUA, CUBA, AND THE USSR COULD HELP THE FMLN, AS MANY\nARE SAYING, THE FIREPOWER OF OUR FORCES COULD NEVER BE COMPARED TO THE\nARMY'S.\n\n   NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN HAS OPENED IN ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE\n(UNITED) STATES, THE NECESSARY WAYS FOR US TO OBTAIN OUR ARMS AND\nAMMUNITION.  WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THIS.  HOW DOES THE FMLN LEARN TO FIGHT--\nBY FIGHTING.  WE ARE NOW FIGHTING IN CITIES.  EVERY MILITARY ANALYST KNOWS\nHOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIGHT IN URBAN AREAS.  THE FMLN FIGHTING IN SAN\nSALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, AND USULUTAN HAS SHOWN THE\nORGANIZATION'S TREMENDOUS ABILITY TO WEAR OUT THE ENEMY, TAKE AND HOLD\nPOSITIONS, AND MANEUVER IN THE CITY JUST AS IT HAS DONE IN RURAL AREAS.  THE\nFMLN ABILITY HAS SURPRISED THE MILITARY ANALYSTS AT THE PENTAGON.  OUR FRONT\nHAS ALWAYS HAD THIS ABILITY.  BUT NOW WE HAVE CHANGED OUR STRATEGY AND\nTACTICS TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY PLANS.  THE (ARMED) FORCES HAVE A SPECIFIC PLAN\nREGARDING THE ACTIONS BY PATROLS (WORDS INDISTINCT), SPECIAL OPERATIONS.\nTHE FMLN HAD TO CHANGE ITS STRATEGY TO STRIKE AT THE SMALL FORCES THAT TRIED\nTO INFILTRATE OUR ZONE UNDER COVER.  ONLY THUS COULD WE ANNIHILATE AND\nDEFEAT THESE FORCES AND THEIR STRATEGY.  AND THIS IS WHAT WE DID.  THIS IS\nWHAT MUST BE OBSERVED, HOW THE FMLN HAS CHANGED ITS MILITARY STRATEGY TO\nFACE THE ONE USED BY THE (ARMED) FORCES.  OF COURSE, WE HAVE ACCUMULATED\nGREAT EXPERIENCE OVER THE YEARS, WHICH WE HAVE APPLIED THESE LAST DAYS IN\nCOMBAT IN (SAN) SALVADOR AND (SAN) MIGUEL.  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS ARE\nBEING DESTROYED IN STREETS AND AVENUES; HELICOPTERS ARE BEING SHOT DOWN;\nSOLDIERS ARE BEING TAKEN PRISONER; AND ARMS ARE BEING SEIZED.\n\n    MILITARY ANALYSTS ARE WONDERING HOW A GUERRILLA ARMY CAN OPERATE FOR SO\nLONG IN AN URBAN AREA.  IN ADDITION, LOGISTICS MUST BE TAKEN INTO\nCONSIDERATION.  THE (ARMED) FORCES ARE CONSTANTLY GETTING AMMUNITION THROUGH\nTHE ILOPANGO (AIR) BASE.  THE FMLN HAS BEEN ABLE TO CARRY OUT THIS OPERATION\nBECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT.  THOUSANDS OF CAPITAL RESIDENTS COOPERATED\nBY KEEPING SILENT WHEN THEY SAW THE GUERRILLA COLUMNS PASS BY.

I LATER HEARD THAT THE\nSALVADORAN ARMY HAD MURDERED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, AMONG THEM A PRIEST\nWHO HAD BEEN DEAN OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY HERE IN NICARAGUA.

THE PHENOMENON WHICH ENSUED AFTER THE MASSES JOINED THE\nOFFENSIVE IN ITS EARLY STAGES FORCED THE ENEMY TO INDISCRIMINATELY USE\nTHE AIR FORCE TO PREVENT A GENERAL UPRISING AND TO CURTAIL THE\nINSURRECTION.  NEVERTHELESS, THE EFFORT EXERTED TO LAUNCH A NATIONWIDE\nOFFENSIVE HAS BEEN BASED ON A LARGE-SCALE PEASANT AND SUBURBAN\nINSURRECTION PROCESS.  OUR RANKS WERE CONSIDERABLY INCREASED TO RENDER\nTHE OFFENSIVE EFFECTIVE, AND THIS WAS POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE PEOPLE'S\nGREAT INTEREST IN FIGHTING IN THE CITIES AND SPEEDING UP THE OUTCOME\nOF THE WAR.  THE PEOPLE ALSO JOINED OUR RANKS DURING THE FIGHTING\nWHICH OCCURRED IN THE CITIES.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, THE GERM OF A NEW SOCIAL EXPLOSION HAS BEEN CREATED BY\nTHE GOVERNMENT ITSELF, WITH ITS INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND\nREPRESSION.  EVEN THOUGH SOME PEOPLE MAY BLAME THE FMLN FOR THE ARMY'S\nBRUTAL REACTION, FEW CAN FEEL ANY SYMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BOMBED\nTHEM.  THIS HAS CREATED A SOCIAL SITUATION WHICH GUARANTEES THE\nCONTINUITY OF THE FMLN'S OFFENSIVE UNTIL VICTORY IS ACHIEVED.  ALL THE\nPEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE BOMBINGS ARE DISSATISFIED PEOPLE WHO WILL JOIN\nTHE STRUGGLE SOONER OR LATER.\n\n   WE REMEMBER THE PHENOMENON OF THE DISPLACED PEOPLE AND REFUGEES\nCAUSED BY THE BOMBINGS IN THE SALVADORAN COUNTRYSIDE.  THE BRUTAL\nATTITUDE OF THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE HAS LEGITIMIZED THE ARMED STRUGGLE.\nTHE OTHER PARTY, MEANING THE ENEMY, HAD TO GRAB ALL THE RESOURCES OF A\nCONVENTIONAL WAR: AIRPLANES, HELICOPTERS, AND HEAVY ARTILLERY.  THIS\nLEGITIMIZES THE PEOPLE'S ARMED STRUGGLE AND SELF-DEFENSE.\n\n   A THIRD GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL AND STRATEGIC EFFORT\nEXERTED AGAINST FASCISM HAS BEEN THE LIBERATION OF LARGE ZONES OF THE\nNATIONAL TERRITORY.  A NEW, EMERGING POWER NOW CONTROLS EIGHT\nDEPARTMENTS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE ARMY IS SPREAD THIN AND IT HAD TO\nABANDON THE ZONES WHERE IT CANNOT KEEP ITS MEN -- COMPROMISED AS IT IS\nIN THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE OF THE CITIES.  THIS PUTS THE ARMY THROUGHOUT\nTHE NATIONAL TERRITORY IN A SITUATION RESEMBLING A CLOTH WITH MANY\nHOLES, STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT AND THREATENING TO RIP AT ANY POINT.\nTHE TEAR CAN OCCUR WHEN LEAST EXPECTED.  LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE ARE\nNOW IN THOSE LIBERATED TERRITORIES, ENGAGED IN A RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT\nAND ORGANIZING A REARGUARD FOR THE MARCH ON THE CITIES.\n\n   THERE IS A FOURTH ELEMENT TO CONSIDER: ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST\nIMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOW A BETTER BALANCE\nFOR NEGOTIATIONS.  ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMANDS AND PROPOSALS AT\nTHE NEGOTIATION TABLE ARE COMPLETELY NULL AND VOID.  THE PRETENSE OF\nDEMANDING THE FMLN'S SURRENDER IS UNTIMELY GIVEN SUCH A SHOW OF\nSTRENGTH.

IT IS TRYING TO LINK THESE ORGANIZATIONS\nAND THESE PERSONS TO THE FMLN.\n\n   THE FMLN COMPLETELY DENIES THAT IT HAS ANY LINK WITH U.S. CITIZEN\nJENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE DENOUNCE THIS ACCUSATION AS A CLUMSY SET UP BY\nTHE ARMED FORCES COMMAND, WHICH IS TRYING -- WE REPEAT -- TRYING TO\nREPRESS THESE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.  THIS IS A\nSET UP BY THE ARMED FORCES TO REPRESS FOREIGN CITIZENS AND -- WE\nREPEAT -- IT IS A SMOKE SCREEN TO DIVERT U.S. ATTENTION FROM THE CASE\nTHAT IS PRESENTLY ON THE TABLE.

THE FACT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO\nWORSEN THE TERROR.  WITH THIS IN MIND, THE GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING A\nLAW TO PUNISH THE OPPOSITION.  AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE, CONGRESS HAS\nALREADY APPROVED ANTITERRORIST BILLS.  THESE BILLS ALLOW THE ARREST OF\nPEOPLE ON SUSPICION OF ANTIGOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES.\n\n   A SALVADORAN DEPUTY HAS LABELED THESE BILLS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND\nCONTRARY TO HUMAN RIGHTS.

THE PAPER STATES THAT THIS IS\nOBVIOUS TO ALL AND THAT THE SALVADORAN REGIME AND THE YANKEE\nGOVERNMENT ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT REFUSE TO ADMIT IT.\n\n   FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW THIS ATTITUDE IS REASONABLE.  WASHINGTON'S\nPOLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR IS BASED ON THE ULTRARIGTHWING FORCES (WORDS\nINDISTINCT).  THE BOSTON GLOBE ADDS THAT EVERY YEAR THE TAXPAYERS TAKE\nOUT OF THEIR POCKETS $500 MILLION TO FINANCE THE ASSISTANCE THAT THE\nU.S. GOVERNMENT GIVES TO EL SALVADOR.  SOME OF THIS MONEY GOES TO THE\nDEATH SQUADS WHICH ARE GUILTY OF THOUSANDS OF MURDERS COMMITED AMID\nHELLISH TORTURES.

THE UNITED STATES\nCERTAINLY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND SO HAS\nPRESIDENT CRISTIANI BY DECLARING THAT HE WILL NOT ATTEND THE REGIONAL\nPRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER IN MANAGUA.\n\n   APPARENTLY, CRISTIANI NEEDED TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA IN\nORDER NOT TO ATTEND TO THE SUMMIT.  THIS IS COMPREHENSIBLE BECAUSE THE\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE COMPLIANCE\nWITH THE TELA AGREEMENTS, THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS, AND THE\nCONTINUATION OF PEACE TALKS IN EL SALVADOR. IN FACT, CRISTIANI WAS\nUNABLE TO JUSTIFY HIS REFUSAL TO ATTEND THIS SUMMIT.\n\n   THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY CRISTIANI WISHES TO USE THE BREAK WITH\nNICARAGUA AS A MASK.  HE IS TRYING TO DISTRACT PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM\nTHE SALVADORAN ARMY'S HEAVY BOMBINGS OF HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS,\nINCLUDING THE CAPITAL, AND THE REPRESSION AGAINST SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS\nAND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n   IN OTHER TERMS, CRISTIANI WANTS TO CONCEAL THE FACT THAT HE CANNOT\nCONTROL THE EXCESSES COMMITTED BY HIS GENERALS; THAT IS, THE GENOCIDE\nTHAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS PERPETRATING AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE.  THE\nCRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO UNABLE TO CONTROL THE DEATH SQUADS\nWHICH ARE MURDERING PEOPLE WITH IMPUNITY.\n\n   IT IS REVEALING THAT SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE CRISTIANI DECLARED THE\nBREAK OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA, NICARAGUAN EMBASSY STAFF IN\nSAN SALVADOR WERE EVACUATED HOME IN FACE OF THE DEATH THREATS BY THE\nDEATH SQUADS.

IN VIEW OF A POSSIBLE INTENSIFICATION OF THE SALVADORAN\nCONFLICT, IT IS NECESSARY TO NOTE THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES\nWERE THE FIRST ONES TO ESCALATE THE WAR BY LAUNCHING INDISCRIMINATE\nATTACKS AND AIR BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN DENSELY\nPOPULATED URBAN AREAS.  THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAD BEEN DOING\nTHIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN OUR COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS.  IN VIEW OF THE\nDAMAGE THAT THIS CAUSES THE POPULATION, SINCE 1987 THE FMLN HAS MADE\nPROPOSALS TO SCALE DOWN THE WAR AND SUSPEND THE USE OF AIRCRAFT AND\nAVIATION EQUIPMENT.\n\n   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S CHARGES ARE HYPOCRITICAL, AS THE\nGOVERNMENT ITSELF HAS TURNED AIRCRAFT INTO REAL INSTRUMENTS OF\nGENOCIDE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.\n\n   2.  THE POLICY OF THE PREVIOUS U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS TURNED\nCENTRAL AMERICA INTO A HUGE ARMS MARKET WHEREBY THOUSANDS OF TONS OF\nSOVIET AND U.S. WEAPONS, INCLUDING SURFACE-TO AIR MISSILES, HAVE BEEN\nINTRODUCED INTO THE AREA.  THIS HAS CREATED A FLOURISHING BLACK MARKET\nFOR WEAPONS, WHERE SALVADORAN AND HONDURAN MILITARY MEN AND NICARAGUAN\nCONTRAS PARTICIPATE AS BIG-TIME SMUGGLERS.\n\n   3.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN A CAMPAIGN OF ACCUSATIONS\nAGAINST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF PUTTING UP A\nSMOKE SCREEN TO COVER THE GENOCIDE IT HAS UNLEASHED AND TO DIVERT THE\nATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS BEEN DEMANDING:\n\n       A) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT STOP THE MASSIVE AND\nINDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS IN DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS AND THE\nPERSECUTION AGAINST THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND GRASS ROOTS\nMOVEMENTS;\n\n       B) AN INVESTIGATION TO CLEAR UP THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT\nPRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTIC WORKERS, ALONG WITH THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THESE AND SIMILAR CRIMES; AND,\n\n       C) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPT THE CEASE-FIRE IT HAS\nHERETOFORE REJECTED AND JUSTIFY ITS INTRANSIGENT AND IRRATIONAL\nPOSITION.\n\n   4.  CRISTIANI'S DECISION TO SUSPEND RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA BASED\nON AN ALLEGED SHIPMENT OF MISSILES FOR THE FMLN IS NOT REASONABLE, NOT\nEVEN BY SAYING THAT THIS REPRESENTS AN ESCALATION OF THE SALVADORAN\nWAR.  IN FACT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ESCALATED THE WAR BY SENDING $4\nBILLION IN AID TO STRENGTHEN THE ARMY AND PROVIDE IT WITH A POWERFUL\nAIR FORCE.\n\n   THE JUSTIFICATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN NICARAGUA'S SUPPORT TO THE FMLN,\nTHUS REFUSING TO ADMIT THE INTERNAL CAUSES OF THE CONFLICT AND ALSO\nKEEPING THE DOORS CLOSED TO ANY NEGOTIATIONS.

EXTRADITION IS NOT\nPUNISHMENT FOR SOCIETY BECAUSE IT REFERS ONLY TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS,\nNEITHER IS IT AN AFFRONT TO SOVEREIGNTY, AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO\nPORTRAY IT.\n\n   EXTRADITION HAS BEEN DEALT WITH IN COLOMBIAN INTERNATIONAL\nTREATIES.  THE DIRECTION OF INTERNATIONAL POLICY LIES WITHIN THE\nEXCLUSIVE REALM OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, ACCORDING TO THE\nCONSTITUTION.  CONGRESS CANNOT TAKE THE INITIATIVE OF ABOLISHING\nPUBLIC EXTRADITION TREATIES BY RESORTING TO LEGISLATIVE OR CONSTITUENT\nPROVISIONS.  THIS IS CLEAR IN LIGHT OF COLOMBIAN PUBLIC LAW, AND IT IS\nIMPERATIVE ACCORDING TO THE VIENNA CONVENTION, WHICH COLOMBIA RECENTLY\nAPPROVED.  ACCORDING TO THIS CONVENTION, THE EXTRADITION TREATY WILL\nPREVAIL OVER INTERNAL PROVISIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE TREATIES THAT\nCOLOMBIA HAS SIGNED WITH REGARD TO EXTRADITION CANNOT BE DISREGARDED\nTHROUGH INTERNAL LEGISLATION.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH\nDIPLOMATIC EFFORTS SUCH AS DENOUNCING THE TREATIES AND DIRECTLY\nINFORMING THE COUNTERPART.\n\n   FOR 100 YEARS COLOMBIAN LAW HAS AUTHORIZED THE EXTRADITION OF\nCRIMINALS.  I REPEAT, 100 YEARS, SINCE 1888, AND ONLY NOW, WHEN\nEXTRADITION IS APPLIED TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS, ARE THERE OBJECTIONS TO\nITS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY.  PRACTICALLY ALL THE COUNTRIES\nOF THE WORLD, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTION, HAVE AND APPLY TREATIES TO\nEXTRADITE TERRORISTS OR WHOMEVER COMMITS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, SUCH\nAS DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, NO MORE THAN 30 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED\nTO SEVERAL COUNTRIES THAT REQUESTED THE EXTRADITIONS AND COMPLIED WITH\nTHE NECESSARY LAWS.  THEREFORE, EXTRADITION IS NOT A GENERAL THREAT\nAGAINST ALL COLOMBIANS.  IT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THE\nCRIME OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ABROAD.  SECONDLY, SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID\nTHAT EXTRADITION HAS CREATED VIOLENCE AND, THEREFORE, WITH ITS\nELIMINATION, VIOLENCE WOULD DISAPPEAR.  NEITHER IS TRUE.\n\n   THE VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD BEEN SUFFERED\nPRIOR TO THE 1979 EXTRADITION TREATY.  AFTER THE TREATY WENT INTO\nEFFECT, HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE MURDERED, INCLUDING JUSTICE\nMINISTER RODRIGO LARA BONILLA.  IN DECEMBER 1986, A SUPREME COURT\nDECISION LEFT THE EXTRADITION TREATY INAPPLICABLE.  IN OTHER WORDS,\nAFTER THIS, WHILE EXTRADITION WAS INAPPLICABLE, ATTORNEY GENERAL\nCARLOS MAURO HOYOS WAS SLAIN, BOGOTA MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA WAS\nKIDNAPPED, AND NEWSMAN GUILLERMO CANO, POLITICAL LEADER JAIME PARDO\nLEAL, AND HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE SACRIFICED.

THERE IS EVEN MORE: LET US NOT FORGET ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR\nANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA, COLONEL FRANKLYN\nQUINTERO, AND SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN WHO WERE MURDERED WHEN\nEXTRADITION WAS NOT IN EFFECT.  LET US NOT SAY THAT EXTRADITION HAS\nBROUGHT US VIOLENCE.  A POSTER FOUND AT THE FARM RAIDED LAST WEEK,\nFROM WHERE PABLO ESCOBAR ESCAPED READ: EXTRADITION IS VIOLENCE.  LET\nUS NOT BE FOOLED; VIOLENCE HAS BEEN USED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY\nMURDERING, WHILE FLEEING FROM THE REACTION OF JUSTICE, AND\nINTIMIDATING COLOMBIAN SOCIETY.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN SAID THAT\nEXTRADITION IS UNDIGNIFIED BECAUSE IT SENDS COLOMBIANS ABROAD TO BE\nTRIED, AND THAT IT IS MORE DIGNIFIED FOR THEM TO BE TRIED AND\nCONDEMNED IN THE COUNTRY BY OUR OWN JUDGES.  THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,\nHOWEVER, HAVE SENT MORE THAN 200 COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND JUDICIAL BRANCH\nOFFICIALS TO THEIR GRAVE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE\nMURDER OF DR GUILLERMO CANO HAS MEANT THE DEATH OF WITNESSES, JUDICIAL\nOFFICIALS, AND LAWYERS AND INTIMIDATION AND THREATS TO ALL THOSE WHO\nWANT TO COOPERATE WITH JUSTICE TO RESOLVE A CRIME.  HOW THEN CAN WE\nBELIEVE THESE DRUG TRAFFICKERS?  CAN WE BELIEVE THAT EXTRADITION HAS\nCAUSED THIS VIOLENCE?  CAN WE HAVE A FREE AND DIGNIFIED COUNTRY WITH\nTHESE BANDS OF MULTIMILLIONAIRE MURDERERS?\n\n   I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS IT\nHARMFUL AND DANGEROUS TO SUBMIT EXTRADITION TO A REFERENDUM.  WE KNOW\nTHAT EXTRADITION IS ONLY FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE\nDONE AND WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING.  WE HAVE SUFFERED FROM THEIR\nTERRORIST ACTIONS.  MANY BRAVE COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THE\nSIMPLE REASON OF NOT AGREEING WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING.  DO YOU BELIEVE\nTHAT ON THIS TOPIC OF EXTRADITION THERE COULD BE A CLEAN ELECTORAL\nCAMPAIGN, FREE FROM INTIMIDATION?  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO ARE\nAGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN, WITHOUT FEAR, GIVE THEIR OPINION?  IT\nWOULD BE A CAMPAIGN SLANTED BY TERRORISM, INTIMIDATION, AND DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS' MONEY.\n\n   THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT SUBJECT CITIZENS TO AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT\nWOULD NOT BE TO CONVINCE COLOMBIANS, BUT TO INTIMIDATE THEM.  A\nREFERENDUM IS FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR FREE AND SOVEREIGN DECISION\nON A TOPIC OF GENERAL INTEREST.  TO INCLUDE EXTRADITION IN THE\nREFERENDUM WOULD ONLY SERVE SO THAT A HANDFUL -- LESS THAN 100 -- DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS CAN, BY USING THEIR MONEY AND TERROR, INTIMIDATE PUBLIC\nOPINION, THE MEDIA, AND ALL COLOMBIANS, SO AS TO AVOID BEING TRIED AND\nCONDEMNED FOR CRIMES THAT THEY HAD COMMITTED ABROAD.\n\n   CONDITIONS OF TERRORISM DO NOT ALLOW THIS TOPIC TO BE DECIDED\nFREELY.  I CALL FOR GOOD SENSE, FOR SENSIBLENESS, SO THAT THE DARK\nINTERESTS OF A FEW PRIVATE PEOPLE ARE NOT CONFUSED WITH THE GENERAL\nINTEREST OF ALL COLOMBIANS.  I CALL FOR COLOMBIANS NOT TO ALLOW THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT ARE IN THE FINAL DISCUSSION, OR THE FIRST\nREFERENDUM IN OVER 30 YEARS, TO BE USED IN AN OPPORTUNISTIC WAY TO\nSERVE SELFISH INTERESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CONVINCED THAT THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND THE EXTRAORDINARY REFERENDUM WILL BE AN\nIMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT FOR THE INSTITUTIONS.  THEY WILL ALLOW GREATER\nPARTICIPATION BY THE PEOPLE IN STATE DECISIONS, IN CONGRESS, AND ARE\nWITHOUT DOUBT A STEP TOWARD PEACE.  I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY THAT\nDRUG TRAFFICKERS WANT PEACE AND TRANQUILITY.  I WANT TO SAY THAT\nELIMINATING EXTRADITION WILL NOT BRING TRANQUILITY, BUT IMPUNITY AND\nMORE VIOLENCE.  THIS IS WHY IT IS ADVISABLE THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS NOT\nALLOW INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO BE ENDANGERED OR THE PEACE ACCORDS BE\nPUT TO SERIOUS RISK DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN THE REFERENDUM OF A TOPIC\nTHAT NOT ONLY WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT WOULD BE\nDANGEROUS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.\n\n   AS IS PUBLICLY KNOWN, I WILL TRAVEL ON 3 DECEMBER AT THE OFFICIAL\nINVITATION OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS PART OF COLOMBIA'S\nOPENING TO THE PACIFIC.  THERE, I SHALL MEET WITH EMPEROR AKIHITO;\nWITH PRIME MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU; WITH THE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS; WITH\nINDUSTRIAL, POLITICAL, AND ACADEMIC LEADERS; AND WITH JAPANESE\nGOVERNMENT LENDING AND TRADE ENTITIES.  THERE, I SHALL PRESENT A TRUE\nPICTURE OF COLOMBIA -- A COUNTRY WITH DIFFICULTIES, BUT WITH THE\nNATIONAL RESOLVE TO OVERCOME THEM.  WE ARE A COUNTRY WITH A PROMISING\nFUTURE, WITH HARD-WORKING PEOPLE, AND WITH VAST NATURAL RESOURCES.  A\nFEW CRIMINALS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SNATCH THAT FUTURE FROM US.

HE\nALSO REITERATED HIS SUPPORT FOR ECONOMY AND FINANCE MINISTER CESAR VASQUEZ\nBAZAN, WHO HE SAID IS MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO FACE THE PERUVIAN ECONOMIC\nSITUATION.  GARCIA MADE THESE STATEMENTS AFTER A MEETING WITH THE COUNCIL OF\nMINISTERS.\n\n   (BEGIN RECORDING) (UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER) THE BORDER CLOSURE\nMEASURE EXPIRES TODAY.  WILL IT BE EXTENDED?\n\n   (GARCIA) NO, THE BORDERS WERE NEVER CLOSED.  WE ONLY ESTABLISHED\nSOME RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF TRANSIT PERMITS IN TACNA TO PREVENT AN\nINCREASE OF SMUGGLING BEFORE THE YEAR-END FESTIVITIES.  THE 15-DAY\nTERM OF THAT MEASURE HAS EXPIRED, AND IT WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.\n\n   (REPORTER) APPARENTLY, THAT MEASURE HAS NOT HAD GOOD RESULTS.\n\n   (GARCIA) I THINK THAT IN GENERAL IT HAS YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS\nBECAUSE SMUGGLING HAS PROBABLY DECREASED SOMEWHAT.  AS YOU KNOW, A FEW\nYEARS AGO CHILE ESTABLISHED THE IQUIQUE FREE ZONE WHERE PRODUCTS ARE\nSOLD TO PERU AND BOLIVIA.  THUS A STABLE MARKET OF HUNDREDS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHICH DAILY PASS THOROUGH THE TACNA BORDER WITH\nSMALL PACKAGES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.\n\n   WE SIMPLY RESTRICTED THE PERMITS THEY USE TO BRING IN A TAPE\nRECORDER OR LASER DISC PLAYERS.

THEREFORE, THE DOLLAR DEMAND AND PRICES HAVE INCREASED.\n\n   LAST YEAR, WHEN THE MUC (SINGLE EXCHANGE MARKET) DOLLAR\nEXCHANGE RATE WAS AT 500 INTIS TO A DOLLAR, THE FREE-MARKET DOLLAR\nCLIMBED TO 2,000 INTIS.  LATER IT DROPPED TO 1,000 INTIS IN JANUARY.\nI THINK THAT THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

WE ACKNOWLEDGE\nTHE CURRENT DIFFICULTIES OF THE PERUVIAN ECONOMY AS WELL AS THE EFFORTS OF\nTHE ECONOMY MINISTER.  I EXPRESS MY RECOGNITION OF AND SUPPORT FOR THE\nECONOMY MINISTER BECAUSE HE IS YOUNG, WELL-INTENTIONED, AND VERY HONEST; HE\nHAS PROGRESSIVE IDEAS.

THIS MORNING WE\nRECEIVED REPORTS THAT THE SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY (EPS) HAD BOMBED AND\nSANK SEVERAL HONDURAN BOATS.  WE MEAN CIVILIAN FISHING BOATS.  I WILL\nTELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.\n\n   WE HAVE VERY FEW PATROL BOATS ON THE ATLANTIC COAST AND OUR BOATS\nTHERE ARE IN CHARGE OF PROTECTING NICARAGUA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND WEALTH.\nFOR MANY YEARS, THE NICARAGUAN AIR FORCE AND THE SANDINIST NAVY HAVE\nBEEN CONDUCTING JOINT OPERATIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT THE\nFIRST TIME WE HAVE CONDUCTED SUCH OPERATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE\nTAPED MOST OF THOSE OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE THOROUGH TRAINING\nAND ACCURACY.\n\n   DURING THOSE OPERATIONS, HELICOPTERS HAVE DEPLOYED MEN WHO BOARD\nMOST OF THE SHIPS PARTICIPATING IN THE OPERATIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS,\nHELICOPTERS FOLLOW THE SHIPS AS THEY MOVE ALONG AND THEN SPECIAL\nSANDINIST NAVY FORCES BOARD THE SHIP FROM THE AIR.\n\n   I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED MORE OR LESS.  ON 7 DECEMBER 1989 WE\nCONDUCTED AN OPERATION, BASICALLY BECAUSE SINCE NOVEMBER, WE HAVE\nDETECTED OVER 30 PIRATE SHIPS, IN OTHER WORDS, SHIPS THAT HAVE NEITHER\nLICENSE NOR PERMIT TO FISH IN NICARAGUAN TERRITORIAL WATERS.\n\n   DURING AN OPERATION OF THE TYPE I JUST DESCRIBED, OUR FORCES\nBOARDED THREE BOATS AT 1020 ON 7 DECEMBER.  THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED\nOUT APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES EAST OF PUERTO CABEZAS.  IN OTHER WORDS,\nTHE THREE BOATS WERE BOARDED IN THIS AREA HERE.  (WHEELOCK APPARENTLY\nSHOWS LOCATION ON A MAP).\n\n   THE NAMES OF THE BOATS ARE \"KERRY MAC II\", \"DAVIS JR,\" \"MISS\nPATSY,\" AND ANOTHER ONE CALLED \"TIE WATER\" (NUMBER OF BOATS AS\nHEARD).  THE BOATS WERE CAPTURED AND TAKEN TO ISLA DEL MAIZ.  IN EACH\nBOAT THERE WERE FIVE NICARAGUAN SOLDIERS, ONE AIR FORCE OFFICER, AND\nONE NAVY OFFICER.  AS THE BOATS WERE TAKEN TO ISLA DEL MAIZ, THE\nMEMBERS OF THE \"MISS PATSY\" CREW, WHO NUMBERED APPROXIMATELY 60,\nMUTINIED AGAINST THE SANDINIST OFFICERS ON BOARD.\n\n   THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN AND A COOK DISARMED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS AND\nKILLED HIM.  AS A RESULT OF THE CONFRONTATION, THE COOK WAS KILLED,\nBUT THE CAPTAIN WAS UNHARMED.  AFTER THE MUTINY WAS OVER, AND AT\nAPPROXIMATELY 0.7 MILES FROM CORN, I MEAN ISLA DEL MAIZ, THE SHIP'S\nCAPTAIN RAN THE \"MISS PATSY\" FISHING BOAT AGROUND ON SOME REEF NEAR\nISLA DEL MAIZ GRANDE AND WE WERE FORCED TO, LET US SAY, SAVE ALL THE\nPEOPLE ON BOARD AND TAKE THEM TO CORN ISLAND.\n\n   ONE OF THE \"MISS PATSY\" SAILORS JUMPED OFF THE SHIP AND WE HAVE\nBEEN UNABLE TO FIND HIM.  OF THE TWO BODIES, THAT OF THE ARMY OFFICER\nAND THE COOK, WE HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER THE COOK'S BODY\nBECAUSE THE SHIP SANK.  MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE TAKEN TO\nHOSPITALS IN BLUEFIELDS AND OTHERS ARE BEING HELD BY THE SANDINIST\nNAVY.  THAT IS MORE OR LESS WHAT HAPPENED.\n\n   WHEN THE \"MISS PATSY\" RAN AGROUND, THE CREW MEMBERS OF THE OTHER\nSHIPS CAME TO HELP, AND DURING THIS TIME, APPARENTLY, THE SHIP CALLED\n\"DAVIS JR\" MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A LEGITIMATE\nDEFENSE AND TO THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY IN FAVOR OF THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE, AS THE CONSTITUTION STATES.  SECONDLY, THE FMLN HAS LOST\nALL MANEUVERING OPTIONS.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAID IT CLEARLY\nWHEN THEY STATED THAT THE FMLN HAD NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR VIOLENT\nACTIONS IN EL SALVADOR.  THAT IS WHY WE ARE ONCE AGAIN ASKING FOR AN\nIMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE.  THESE WERE THE SAME WORDS USED AT THE\nSUMMIT HELD IN TELA, HONDURAS.

THIS MEETING\nWAS OF URGENT NATURE TO DISCUSS ISSUES SUCH AS EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA,\nTHE CONTRAS' DEMOBILIZATION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS.\n\n   AT THIS MEETING, WE HELD IN-DEPTH DISCUSSIONS OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE\nBEING EXPERIENCED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE\nSITUATION BEING EXPERIENCED IN NEIGHBORING EL SALVADOR, WHICH IS\nFACING AN INTERNAL CONFLICT -- MORE THAN A DECADE OF CONTINUED WAR AND\nINTERNAL CONFLICT.  EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO A VERY STRONG\nCONFRONTATION, WHICH LATELY HAS WORSENED.  AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE\nCIVILIAN POPULATION, THE CLERGY, NUNS, AND UNION AND LABOR LEADERS\nHAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THIS TRAGIC SITUATION.  AT THIS MEETING,\nNICARAGUA STATED ITS POSITION THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR MUST\nBE RESOLVED THROUGH NEGOTIATION AND NOT BY WAY OF VIOLENCE.  THIS\nPOSITION FULLY COINCIDES WITH THE POSITION THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI\nNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) HAS DEFENDED.  ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS\nTHE FMLN HAS MADE PEACE PROPOSALS AND IT HAS CALLED FOR NEGOTIATED\nSOLUTIONS TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND FOR REAL NEGOTIATIONS.\n\n   FOLLOWING A LENGTHY AND INTENSE DISCUSSION OF THE SALVADORAN ISSUE,\nWE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT, NOT ONLY WITH REGARD TO GENERAL PLEASE AND\nSTATEMENTS CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN THE NEIGHBORING CENTRAL\nAMERICAN COUNTRY, BUT ON VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT COULD LEAD TO\nSOLUTION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  THUS, IN POINT THREE, THE FIVE\nPRESIDENTS DECIDED TO REQUEST THAT THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL MAKE A\nVERY SPECIAL PERSONAL EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TOWARD THE\nTALKS' SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT.\n\n   NICARAGUA HAS THUS SUPPORTED THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION THE FMLN HAS\nVIGOROUSLY AND CONSISTENTLY CALLED FOR, AND WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT\nHEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ALSO CLAIMS TO AGREE.  SUCH NEGOTIATION\nWOULD LEAD TO A DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT WOULD RESULTE IN SOLVING THE\nSALVADORAN CONFLICT.  LIKEWISE, WE UNDERSCORED HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL\nAMERICA, BECAUSE THESE RIGHTS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY VIOLATED IN CERTAIN\nCOUNTRIES.  THIS HAS BEEN CLEARLY STATED AT INTERNATIONAL\nORGANIZATIONS.  I AM ESPECIALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS\nSITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, WHERE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS WERE RECENTLY\nMURDERED, AND WHERE THE ARMY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF EXERTING\nINDISCRIMINATE REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE, THROUGH AERIAL AS WELL\nAS ARTILLERY AND INFANTRY ATTACKS.\n\n   THIS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE IS WORRISOME TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPEOPLE, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND ESPECIALLY TO NICARAGUA.  WE\nALSO REACHED AN AGREEMENT BY WHICH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS\nINSISTED ON THE NEED FOR RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH\nTHE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS RATIFIED\nTHEIR PLEDGES TO FULLY RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE CIVILIAN,\nPOLITICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL RIGHTS ESTABLISHED IN THEIR\nRESPECTIVE CONSTITUTIONS, AND IN SIGNED AND RATIFIED INTERNATIONAL\nAGREEMENTS.\n\n   NICARAGUA'S POSITION HAS NOT WAVERED; IT HAS MAINTAINED ITS\nPOSITIONS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES ARE WILLING TO HAVE\nRECOGNIZED INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS (WORDS INDISTINCT)\nIN OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, AND HELP DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL\nAMERICA.  THERE ARE FORCES, CENTRAL AMERICAN ARMIES ESPECIALLY, AMONG\nTHEM THE SALVADORAN ARMY -- WHICH HAS ORGANIZED DEATH SQUADS THAT\nSYSTEMATICALLY MURDER SALVADORAN PEOPLE -- WHOSE GOVERNMENTS AND\nPRESIDENTS ARE FACED WITH CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IN OVERCOMING THE\nPROBLEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  THIS, I BELIEVE, IS WHERE THE\nGREATEST STRENGTH MUST BE EXERTED AND THE GREATEST EFFORT MADE TO\nDISBAND THE DEATH SQUADS SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS CAN BE RESPECTED, A\nPEACEFUL SOLUTION CAN BE FOUND FOR ALL THE CONFLICTS IN THESE\nCOUNTRIES, AND A WORSENING OF VIOLENCE CAN BE AVOIDED, ESPECIALLY\nSINCE THIS VIOLENCE IS ON THE INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE INJUSTICE THAT\nPREVAILS IN THESE COUNTRIES DUE TO A LACK OF EQUITY, FREEDOM, AND\nJUSTICE, WHICH IS AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.

OUR FIGHTERS HAVE\nCARRIED OUT COUNTLESS HEROIC AND DARING ACTS SINCE THEM.  NEITHER THE\nCONCENTRATION OF THE ELITE BATTALIONS IN SAN SALVADOR NOR THE MILLIONS\nOF DOLLARS OF U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE OR FULL RANGE OF U.S.\nTECHNOLOGY AND EXPERIENCE COULD PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ENTERING AND\nOCCUPYING EXTENSIVE URBAN AREAS AND ORGANIZING STRATEGIC HARASSMENT OF\nTHE CITY.\n\n   OUR HEROIC FIGHTERS ASSAULTED THE COUNTRY'S FIVE MAJOR VITAL\nCENTERS -- SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, SANTA ANA, USULUTAN, AND\nZACATECOLUCA.

WE WANT TO STRESS THAT ALL OUR OFFENSIVES HAVE CENTERED AROUND\nTHE MAIN CITIES IN OUR COUNTRY.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND\nSIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS STRUGGLE BY THE PEOPLE AND THE FMLN\nIS HAVING MAINTAINED THE BESIEGEMENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL\nAND ECONOMIC POINTS, MOST ESPECIALLY ON THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL.  THERE\nHAS BEEN GREAT PRESSURE IN THE CASE OF SAN SALVADOR, AND THE FMLN HAS\nFORCED THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, COLONEL PONCE, AND THE FASCIST HIGH\nCOMMAND TO CHANGE THEIR STRATEGIC TACTICS THREE TIMES.\n\n   YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF FIRST TRIED TO\nDISLODGE THE FMLN FORCES THAT HAD ENTERED SINCE THE EVENING OF 11\nNOVEMBER.  WHEN THE FIRST PUPPET ARMY STRATEGIC DEFENSE TACTIC FAILED,\nTHEY THEN TRIED TO ISOLATE THE FMLN FORCES FROM ONE ANOTHER AND\nANNIHILATE THEM ONE BY ONE.  FOR THIS, THEY CONCENTRATED SPECIAL\nFORCES, ESPECIALLY USING ELITE BATTALIONS, IN A SIEGE MODALITY FOR\nANNIHILATION.  THIS ALSO FAILED.  FACED WITH THE SECOND FAILURE OF\nTHEIR SPECIAL TACTICS TO END THE OFFENSIVE IN A FEW DAYS, AS CRISTIANI\nAND THE HIGH MILITARY COMMAND HAD SAID, THEY MOVED A GREAT NUMBER OF\nOPERATIONAL FORCES FROM THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR, SUCH AS THE ELITE\nBATTALIONS, TO SET UP AN EXTENSIVE SIEGE TO DEFEND THE CAPITAL CITY\nAND PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ENTERING IT.  AS ALL OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nABLE TO SEE -- AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE TO\nVERIFY THIS THROUGH A GREAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FLOWING THROUGH\nINTERNATIONAL REPORTERS -- THAT SIEGE TO KEEP OUT THE FMLN HAS ALSO\nFAILED.  THIS MEANS MORE VICTORIES AND SUCCESSES, SUCH AS INCURSIONS\nINTO THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SOUTHERN AREA OF ANTIGUO\nCUSCATLAN, AND TWO IMPORTANT ATTACKS ON THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.\n\n   RIGHT NOW WE SEE THAT THE PUPPET ARMY'S SPECIAL CITY OPERATION IS\nTHEIR THIRD AND LAST PLAN.  THEY HAVE FORMED FOUR COMMANDS TO CONTROL\nTHE CITY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE DEFEATED BY OUR FMLN MILITARY FORCES.  WE\nALSO MUST ADD TO THIS LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS THAT THE GREAT\nCONCENTRATION OF ENEMY ARMY OPERATIONAL FORCES IN THE CAPITAL HAS\nCAUSED A GREAT NATIONAL IMBALANCE IN FORCES.  THIS MEANS THAT\nEXTENSIVE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY ARE WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF THE\nPUPPET TROOPS.  WE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND HAVE WORKED ON\nORGANIZING THE PEOPLE AND RAISING A PEOPLE'S POWER, AN ALTERNATIVE TO\nLOCAL REACTIONARY POWER.\n\n   WE ALSO RECORD AS A SUCCESSFUL OFFENSIVE DURING THIS FIRST MONTH\nTHE FACT THAT OUR ENEMY'S INTELLIGENCE WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETELY\nSMASHED.  THE SEARCHES, WHICH HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED IN AN IMPROVISED\nMANNER TO MILITARY TROOPS CONCENTRATED IN THE CITIES, ESPECIALLY THE\nREPRESSIVE CORPS, HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE ALL THE INTELLIGENCE DATA\nBANKS TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND DESTROY THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE.  WE MUST\nALSO RECORD AS ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF OUR GENERAL OFFENSIVE DURING\nTHIS FIRST MONTH THE FACT THAT THE PUPPET ARMY WAS FORCED TO ABORT\nANOTHER PLAN.  EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SOME BLOODY EVENTS, SUCH AS THE\nMURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, ALONG WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF KIDNAPPINGS\nAND MISSING PEOPLE AND ARRESTS OF MEMBERS OR LEADERS OF GRASSROOT\nPEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS, WE FEEL THAT THE ARMY AND REPRESSIVE CORPS ARE\nINCAPABLE OF ATTENDING TO THE FMLN OFFENSIVE AND THE BESIEGEMENT AT\nTHE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THEIR ANNIHILATION OF\nTHE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.

THEIR 1-MONTH-LONG FIERCE BATTLE HAS LEFT\n3,000 PEOPLE DEAD AND ALSO CAST A SHADOW OVER THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE\nPROCESS.\n\n   THE CURRENT CIVIL WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS TRIGGERED OFF BY THE\nDESTRUCTION OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE LABOR FEDERATION, THE COUNTRY'S\nBIGGEST TRADE UNION ORGANIZATION.  ON 31 OCTOBER, AN ULTRARIGHTIST\n\"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD\" SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY USED\nA HEAVY BOMB TO BOMBARD THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING OF THE LABOR\nFEDERATION, KILLING AND WOUNDING OVER 40 PEOPLE INCLUDING PRINCIPAL\nLEADERS OF THE FEDERATION.  ON 2 NOVEMBER, THE GUERRILLAS ISSUED A\nSTATEMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ACTIVITY OF THE SQUAD AND\nDECLARING THE CANCELLATION OF THE THIRD ROUND OF TALKS WITH THE\nGOVERNMENT SCHEDULED IN VENEZUELA.  ON THE SAME NIGHT THE GUERRILLAS\nLAUNCHED A LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE \"TO ELIMINATE FASCISM.\"  ABOUT 8,000\nGUERRILLAS SWIFTLY CAPTURED MANY TOWNS AND STRATEGIC POSITIONS\nNORTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL AND CUT KEY COMMUNICATIONS LINES BETWEEN THE\nCAPITAL AND THE HINTERLAND.  IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ALSO ATTACKED SOME\n50 GOVERNMENT ARMY BASES AND POLICE STATIONS IN THE HINTERLAND, THUS\nCONTROLLING 30 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY.  THEY HAVE\nESTABLISHED \"LOCAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENTS\" IN 8 OF THE 14 PROVINCES\nTHROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  DURING THIS PERIOD, THE GOVERNMENT DISPATCHED\nARMORED CARS AND AIR FORCE UNITS TO CARRY OUT COUNTERATTACKS.  THEY\nWANTONLY BOMBARDED THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY\nOCCUPIED BY THE GUERRILLAS.  AFTER 8 DAYS OF FIERCE BATTLE, THE\nGUERRILLAS SHOT DOWN 12 GOVERNMENT FIGHTER PLANES AND HELICOPTERS;\nDESTROYED 34 TANKS, ARMORED CARS, AND PATROL CARS; AND CAPTURED A\nLARGE AMOUNT OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION.  SUBSEQUENTLY BATTLES CONTINUED\nIN REGIONS OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL CITY.

FIERCE BATTLES HAVE ALSO BROKEN\nOUT IN CHALATENANGO, SAN MIGUEL, AND OTHER TOWNS, THEREBY CAUSING\nHEAVY CASUALTIES AND PROPERTY LOSSES.\n\n   THIS WAR HAS DEEP-ROOTED CAUSES.  EL SALVADOR IS A SMALL COUNTRY\nWITH AN AREA OF 21,000 SQUARE KM AND A POPULATION OF 5 MILLION.\nDURING THIS 10-YEAR-LONG WAR, 70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND THE NATIONAL\nECONOMY HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY DESTROYED.  THE ULTRARIGHTIST NATIONALIST\nREPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) WON THE GENERAL ELECTION EARLY THIS YEAR,\nTHUS AGGRAVATING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE\nGOVERNMENT.  PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, THE GUERRILLAS PUT FORWARD A PEACE\nPROPOSAL DEMANDING SIX MONTHS' POSPONEMENT OF THE ELECTION SO AS TO\nMAKE THEIR PARTICIPATION POSSIBLE.  BUT THIS PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED BY\nTHE GOVERNMENT.  BECAUSE ALMOST HALF OF THE VOTERS DID NOT VOTE, THE\nGUERRILLAS DECLARED IT DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.\nPRESSED BY DOMESTIC PUBLIC OPINION AND URGED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPEACE AGREEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS HELD TWO ROUNDS OF\nTALKS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER.  DURING THEIR TALKS THE GUERRILLAS\nDEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT STOP ITS SUPPRESSION, INTRODUCE\nPOLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND JUDICIAL REFORMS, REORGANIZE THE ARMED\nFORCES, AND PUNISH THE \"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD.\"  THE GOVERNMENT INSISTED\nTHAT THE GUERRILLAS SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS BEFORE REFORMS WERE\nCARRIED OUT.  THE HARD-LINE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT REFLECTED THE\nESTABLISHED POLICY OF THE RULING PARTY, WHICH HAS ALL ALONG STOOD FOR\nRULING THE COUNTRY BY MILITARY MEANS, ADVOCATED THE SUPPRESSION OF\nDEMOCRATIC FORCES, AND SUPPORTED THE \"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD\" IN CARRYING\nOUT ASSASSINATION.  A UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT IN CENTRAL AMERICA WAS\nASSASSINATED BY THE SQUAD FOR CRITICIZING THE ULTRARIGHTIST POLICY OF\nTHE RULING PARTY.  RECENTLY THE RULING PARTY SUPPORTED THE\n\"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD\" IN ATTACKING THE LABOR FEDERATION'S BUILDING.\nTHIS IGNITED THE CURRENT CIVIL WAR AND UNDERMINED THE PEACE PROCESS IN\nTHE COUNTRY.

ENDARA\nHIMSELF HAD TO SAY -- BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE\nTHINKING, THOUGH A PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE INDIFFERENT -- THAT HE DID\nNOT CALL THEM.  DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?  PRESIDENT ENDARA SAYS\nTHAT HE DIDN'T CALL FOR THE INVASION.  THIS SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY\nUNDERSTOOD. FOR SOME REASON HE SAID IT.  SO I WOULD NOT CALL IT A\nHARDENING. I BEG YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE EXACT SHADE OF THE TERM. WE ARE\nENERGIC IN OPPOSING A CONCRETE FACT, BUT WHAT DO THE PEOPLE OF NEW\nHAMPSHIRE, THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA, THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, THE PEOPLE\nOF JEFFERSON, OF WHITMAN, OF LINCLON -- THAT GREAT DEFENDER OF HUMAN\nRIGHTS AND RACIAL EQUALITY -- WHAT HAVE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THAT ACT?\nWE HAVE TO RESPECT THE GREATNESS OF THE UNITED STATES. FROM LATIN\nAMERICA, THE UNITED STATES IS SEEN IN VARIOUS WAYS. FOR THE TIME\nBEING, I SEE IT AS THE ROME OF THE MODERN WORLD. I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT\nTHAT THE LATIN AMERICANS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD INSIDE THE UNITED STATES.\nTHE LATIN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE HAS TO SEEN INSIDE THE UNITED STATES.\nTHEN A SOUND RELATIONSHINP WILL EMERGE BETWEEN THE TWO CONTINENTS.\nBECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS THE ROME OF THE MODERN WORLD -- FOR THE\nCAPACITY OF ITS ATOMIC LEGIONS; FOR THEIR HAVING CONCENTRATED SCIENCE\nAND PHILOSOPHY, ALTHOUGH BOTH WERE BROUGHT OVER FROM EUROPE AS THE\nROMANS BROUGHT THEM FROM GREECE; FOR THEIR HAVING GENERATED AN\nEXTRAORDINARY TECHNOLOGY, AND FOR THEIR BEING A DEMOCRACY -- THE\nUNITED STATES MUST BE RESPECTED.  WE WILL HAVE TO DISTINGUISH ALL THAT\nFROM A PARTICULAR ACT BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS WHY WE SAY\nAMERICANS REFERRING TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND SAY YANKEE\nTO DEFINE SOME ACTS BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. SO I DON'T BELIEVE,\nSIR, THAT THERE IS A HARDENING, AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THEY\nUNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL. I BELIEVE THEY UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TELL THEM\nTHAT I CANNOT SIT AT THE TABLE WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE KILLING\nPANAMANIAN PEOPLE. LET THE MINISTERS, THE POLICE CHIEFS, THE\nPROSECUTORS, THE ATTORNEY GENERALS SIT AT A TABLE.  THAT IS GOOD.  BUT\nTHE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION?  DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN? I\nTHINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN IT. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT\nWOULD BE A BAD THING FOR MR MANTILLA TO SIT WITH MR BENNETT OR WITH\nTHE JUSTICE MINISTER OF COLOMBIA. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE BAD.\nTHIS IS THE PROOF THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE THE ANTIDRUG PLAN. BUT\nTHOSE WHO PERSONIFY THE NATION CANNOT MEET.  WE CANNOT DO SO UNDER THE\nPRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  SO THIS IS NOT HARDENING.  AS FOR THE IMF, I\nBELIEVE THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT MATTER.  THESE MATTERS ARE\nWELL DIFFERENTIATED. I AM NOT HERE AS A DEMAGOGUE, AS SOME RIGHT WING\nMEDIA ASSERT.  THOSE PEOPLE ARE FIGHTENED WHEN I DRAW A LOT OF PEOPLE\nDESPITE MY POLTICAL DECLINE.  I AM NOT BEING A DEMAGOGUE, AND I AM NOT\nHERE BECAUSE THE BEST WAY TO WIN VOTES IS TO INDULGE IN ANTI-AMERICAN\nPOLITICS FROM HERE UNTIL 28 JULY 1990. I WILL NOT LAPSE INTO THAT\nIRRESPONSIBILITY. HERE WE HAVE A CONCRETE FACT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO\nWITH OUR CULTURAL, COMMERCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH\nORGANIZATIONS WHERE THE UNITED STATES MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE INFLUENCE.\nI SEPARATE THINGS VERY WELL.

LUIS PAZOS, SAYS THAT \"THE PRIESTS WERE MARXIST\nGUERRILLA SYMPATHIZERS\" AND THAT THE UNIVERSITY IN WHICH THEY WORK \"IS\nKNOWN IN EL SALVADOR AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS.\"\n\n   THE ARTICLE SPEAKS OF \"THESE PRIESTS' NEOMARXIST-PHILOSOPHICAL\nPOSITION WHICH IS CONTRARY TO CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE.\"\n\n   I WISH TO STATE THAT:\n\n   1. THE MURDERED PRIESTS WERE NOT SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MARXIST\nGUERRILLAS.  THEY ONLY TRIED TO TALK WITH THE DIFFERENT SECTORS IN\nCONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR, SEEKING TO MEDIATE IN AN EFFORT TO FIND PEACE\nWITH JUSTICE.\n\n   2. PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR CONSIDER THE UCA (CENTRAL\nAMERICAN UNIVERSITY) AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS,\nBUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THE UCA COURAGEOUSLY\nFOLLOWS THE CHURCH'S SOCIAL DOCTRINE.  THIS STATEMENT, IF MADE WITHOUT\nTHE RESERVATION THAT IT ONLY REPRESENTS THE VIEWS OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE\nAND THE FACT THAT THE ARTICLE FORGETS TO MENTION THE MANY OTHERS DO\nNOT BELIEVE, IS IN OUR OPINION A MANIPULATION OF THE TRUTH.\n\n   3. THE POSITION OF THE PRIESTS WAS NOT \"NEOMARXIST\" IN THE\nPHILOSOPHICAL FIELD.  FATHER ELLACURIA CAME FROM THE SCHOOL OF THE\nSPANISH PHILOSOPHER ZUBIRI, WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE DEEPLY ROOTED IN\nCHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY.  FATHER AMANDO LOPEZ WROTE HIS DOCTORAL THESIS\nON THE SPANISH PHILOSOPHER AND PRIEST AMOR RUIBAL.  THE \"ZUBIRIAN\"\nINCLINATION OF FATHER ELLACURIA WAS INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN IN MOST\nPHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOLS.  THOSE WHO ACCUSE THE MURDERED PRIESTS OF\nHAVING NEOMARXIST PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS ARE PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGING\nTHEIR IGNORANCE.\n\n   4. STATEMENTS SUCH AS THESE, WHICH WERE REPEATED IN OTHER MEDIA\nBEFORE THE MURDER OF THE PRIESTS, PARTLY PROMOTED THEIR MURDER.  WE\nTHEREFORE CONSIDER THEIR REPETITION TO BE A VERY SERIOUS MATTER.\n\n   ON PAGE 7, AND IN AN EDITORIAL ARTICLE, THE NEWSPAPER MENTIONS THE\nNEED TO AVOID \"THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY PRIVATE PSEUDO-INVESTIGATIONS,\nWHEREVER THEY MIGHT COME FROM.\"  ON THIS STATEMENT I WANT TO SIMPLY\nADD THAT IN A CASE LIKE THIS THE INJURED PARTY HAS EVERY RIGHT, BOTH\nIN EL SALVADOR AND IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD, TO CONDUCT ITS OWN\nPRIVATE INVESTIGATION.

HOWEVER, ONCE THEY HAVE OUTLIVED THEIR USEFULNESS, NOT ONLY\nARE THEY ABANDONED, BUT NOW THEY ARE EVEN KIDNAPPED, JAILED, AND\nSENTENCED.\n\n   THIS HAPPENED TO PEREZ JIMENEZ OF VENEZUELA; LEONIDAS TRUJILLO OF\nTHE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, WHO WAS MURDERED BY THE CIA; SOMOZA OF\nNICARAGUA; AND LATELY NORIEGA OF PANAMA.\n\n   THESE MEN ARE VALUED ONLY AS LONG AS THEY ARE USEFUL TO THE UNITED\nSTATES.

IF A\nCOUNTRY HAS ANY POLITICAL, MILITARY, OR STRATEGIC VALUE, THAT COUNTRY\nWILL ENJOY WASHINGTON'S PREFERENCE. HOWEVER, ONCE THE INTEREST NO\nLONGER EXISTS, THE AID IS OVER. IF THE INTEREST DECREASES, THE AID\nDECRESES.\n\n   HONDURAS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THIS POLICY FOR THE WORLD TO SEE.\nTHE POINDEXTER TRIAL SHOWED THAT OVER THE SENATE'S OBJECTION, SPECIAL\nAID WAS GRANTED TO HONDURAS IN EXCHANGE FOR CONVERTING IT INTO A\nLEASED TERRITORY FOR CONTRA OPERATIONS.\n\n   THE YEARS IN WHICH OUR TERRITORY SHAMEFULLY SERVED TO SHED BLOOD IN\nONE OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, ARE YEARS IN WHICH HONDURAS WAS\nREGARDED AS A COUNTRY DESERVING MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID.\n\n   WITH THE CHANGE OF U.S. POLICY, AFTER IT ACCEPTED ITS MILITARY\nFAILURE AGAINST NICARAGUA, HONDURAS IS NO LONGER THE APPLE OF ITS EYE,\nACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES.  THAT IS WHY THE UNITED STATES IS NOT\nONLY GRUDGING ITS AID, BUT IS NOT EVEN GRANTING THE SCANT AID ALREADY\nAPPROVED, UNLESS HONDURAS AGREES TO ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS.\n\n   THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE.  SINCE THE UNITED STATES IS THE IMF'S MOST\nIMPORTANT MEMBER AND SUPPORTER, IT HAS ASKED THE IMF TO TIGHTEN THE\nSCREWS ON HONDURAS, AND TO EVEN LET HONDURAS USE UP ITS MEAGER GOLD\nRESERVES UNTIL HONDURAS IS FORCED TO SAY, \"FORGIVE ME, MASTER.\"\n\n   AS WE CAN RECALL, WHEN THE GOLD STANDARD WAS ABANDONED FOR THE\nDOLLAR STANDARD AND SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS, THE IMF, AND OTHER\nMEASURES WERE CREATED, EACH COUNTRY DEPOSITED GOLD RESEVES TO BACK UP\nITS CURRENCY EXCHANGE.  THEREAFTER, ITS MONETARY BACKING WOULD DEPEND\nON ITS RESERVE OF DOLLARS AND OTHER STRONG CURRENCIES.\n\n   THAT IS HOW GETTING FOREIGN RESERVES BECAME THE MAIN CONCERN OF\nNATIONS, IF THEY WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE PARITY OF THEIR CURRENCY.\n\n   AS A RESULT OF THE OIL CRISIS, WHICH ON THE ONE HAND SAVED THE\nOIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES, AND ON THE OTHER HAND DEALT A BLOW TO THE OIL\nIMPORTERS, PLUS THE UNCONTROLLED FOREIGN DEBT THAT THE PETRODOLLARS\nBOOM BROUGHT WITH IT, THE COUNTRIES WENT TO THE HILT IN DEBT.  AT THE\nSAME TIME THEY LOST HUGE SUMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BECAUSE OF\nTHE DROP IN THE PRICES OF COFFEE, SILVER, TIN, COPPER, AND OTHER\nEXPORT PRODUCTS.\n\n   IN SHORT, THE SOURCE OF EXCHANGE DECREASED FOR EVERYONE, EVEN\nTHOUGH PRODUCTION OF EACH ITEM INCREASED.  DEBTS GREW UNTIL THEY\nBECAME NIGHTMARES THAT ABSORBED ALMOST ALL THE COUNTRY'S FOREIGN\nINCOME.  THE MONETARY RESERVES THAT WERE BACKING THE CURRENCIES FELL.\nTHAT IS WHY IN LATIN AMERICA THERE HAS BEEN ONE DEVALUATION AFTER\nANOTHER, COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY.\n\n   IN THE BEGINNING THE IMF USED WHAT WAS CALLED A STAND-BY LOAN, WHICH\nHELPED COUNTRIES WHEN THEY RAN SHORT OF RESERVES.  WITH THOSE EMERGENCY\nLOANS THEY COULD MAINTAIN THE PARITY OF THEIR CURRENCY, UNTIL THEY COULD\nBALANCE THEIR RESERVES.\n\n   HOWEVER, COUNTRIES LIKE HONDURAS, WHICH WERE DEEPLY INDEBTED, BEGAN\nTO FILL THEIR LACK OF INTERNATIONAL RESERVES WITH LOANS AND DONATIONS.\nEVEN SO THE COUNTRY CONTINUED TO PAY ITS IMPORTS AND EXPENSES IN\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE, UNTIL IT REACHED THE CURRENT SITUATION IN WHICH WE\nCANNOT PAY THE DEBT. WE ARE OVERDUE $140 MILLION IN PAYMENTS ON OUR\nDEBT. OUR CREDIT IS NO LONGER GOOD.

A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY RELEASED A REPORT\nTO THE U.S. MEDIA FROM MAY 1989 THAT SHOWED THAT PERU HAD BROKEN ALL\nRECORDS FOR ERADICATING COCA IN 1988, IN KEEPING WITH ITS\nINTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.

THE PROBLEM BEGINS THERE.  THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR\nPROVIDING MASSIVE RESOURCES SHOULD BE ASSUMED THROUGH CONCERTED\nDIALOGUE, NOT UNILATERAL MEASURES, BECAUSE THERE ARE HAWKS IN THE\nUNITED STATES.

(SILENCE IS\nGOLDEN).  AT A MEETING AT THE INTERIOR MINISTER'S OFFICE ON 31\nJANUARY, THE MINISTER TOLD COCA PRODUCERS THAT HOY DID NOT REPORT THE\nPRELIMINARY AGENDA...  AND THAT THE PRESIDENT'S CRITERION OF \"COCA IN\nRETURN FOR DEVELOPMENT\" HAS PREVAILED.  IF THIS IS THE CASE, AND IF\nTHERE IS CONSENSUS ON THIS POSITION, WHY HASN'T THE COUNTRY BEEN\nINFORMED?\n\n   THE SITUATION HAS BEEN FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE REMARKS BY\nPERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, WHO SAID THAT \"WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED\nTO HAVE BEEN AGREED UPON\" ONE OF THE COUNTRIES INTRODUCED CHANGES THAT\nHAVE \"CHANGED THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE ISSUE.\"  WHAT IS THIS NEW\nCONCEPT?  IS IT ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY OR INDEPENDENCE?\n\n   THE PROGOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA HAS MONOTONOUSLY REITERATED OVER THE\nPAST FEW DAYS THAT TO GOVERN MEANS TO INFORM.  FINE.  WE AGREE THAT TO\nINFORM IS PART OF THE ART OF GOVERNING.  TO INFORM, HOWEVER, ALSO\nMEANS TO TELL THE TRUTH, ESPECIALLY IF IT DEALS WITH AN ISSUE THAT IS\nFUNDAMENTAL TO THE FUTURE OF BOLIVIANS.  THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE\nCONSISTENT, AT LEAST WITH THIS PRINCIPLE.\n\n   PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA HAS REPEATEDLY PROPOSED THE REPLACEMENT\nOF COCA PRODUCTION THROUGH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.  YET THE REMARKS BY\nU.S. EMBASSY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION MARILYN MCAFEE HAVE DEALT AN\nANTICIPATED BLOW THAT HAS CAUSED SOME OFFICIALS TO HESITATE.  \"THERE\nIS $15 MILLION FOR REPLACEMENT,\" SHE SAID.  (THERE IS $60 MILLION FOR\nREPRESSION).  BARELY RECUPERATED FROM HIS SURPRISE, THE FOREIGN\nMINISTER SAID THAT THE U.S. HELP IS A \"BILATERAL ISSUE AND,\nCONSEQUENTLY, IT WILL NOT BE DIRECTLY ADDRESSED\" AT THE CARTAGENA\nSUMMIT.  THE INTERIOR MINISTER, WHO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN THIS TYPE\nOF SITUATION, DID NOT ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO MCAFEE'S STATEMENT AND\nSTRESSED THAT \"MORE EXACT FIGURES WILL BE MENTIONED AT THE CARTAGENA\nSUMMIT.\"  WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH?  WILL THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT ADDRESS\nTHE ECONOMIC AID?\n\n   AFTER THIS PECULIAR SITUATION, THE UNITED STATES SEEMS TO HAVE\nCHOSEN INTERDICTION AND ERADICATION -- REPRESSION -- TO FIGHT DRUG\nTRAFFICKING.  THE STRATEGY OF \"WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING\nTERRORISTS\" HAS PREVAILED.  THIS STRATEGY LENDS ITSELF TO\nINTERVENTIONIST MILITARY POLICIES, SIMILAR TO THE PRESENCE OF U.S.\nMARINES IN BOLIVIA IN THE PAST, OR, IN THE FUTURE, THE CREATION OF A\nMULTINATIONAL MILITARY FORCE THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE REGIONAL POLITICAL\nAND MILITARY STABILITY.\n\n   WHEN THE TRAFFICKING OF COCAINE WAS CARRIED OUT AS A COVERT\nOPERATION (1984-87) INVOLVING THE CIA AND THE U.S. ARMY -- FOR THE\nPURPOSE OF PROVIDING MILITARY SUPPLIES TO THE CONTRAS -- COCAINE\nTRAFFICKING WAS NOT A CRIME.  THE LINKS BETWEEN NORIEGA AND DRUG\nTRAFFICKING WERE A MATTER OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE AS LONG AS HE\nPROVIDED INFORMATION AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR WAR AGAINST NICARAGUA.  BUT\nNOW THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT MIND INVADING PANAMA OR TURNING\nCOLOMBIA INTO AN INFERNO TO CAPTURE NORIEGA OR SOME OF THE MAJOR\nCOLOMBIAN TRAFFICKERS ON THIS CRUSADE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THAT\nIS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S DOUBLE-FACED MORALITY.\n\n   ANOTHER SCANDAL HIT U.S. SOCIETY LAST WEEK.  MARION BARRY, THE\nMAYOR OF WASHINGTON, THE CAPITAL OF THE EMPIRE AND ALSO THE CAPITAL OF\nCRIME, WAS CAUGHT IN AN FBI TRAP.  HE WAS FILMED CONSUMING COCAINE.\nHIS FOLLOWERS CLAIM THAT IT IS A WHITE CONSPIRACY TO PREVENT A BLACK\nMAYOR FROM RUNNING FOR ANOTHER TERM.\n\n   BUT THE INTERESTING POINT FOR US IS THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN\nBENNETT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT STRATEGIST FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING (THE BENNETT PLAN), AND WASHINGTON POLICE CHIEF FULWOOD.\nWHILE BENNETT HAS QUESTIONED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WASHINGTON POLICE,\nCLAIMING THAT THIS AREA RECEIVES THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF FEDERAL SUPPORT\nFOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, FULWOOD HAS SAID THAT\nBENNETT IS WASTING TIME \"TALKING WITHOUT DOING ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING\"\n(NEWSWEEK, 29 JANUARY).  THE NEWSWEEK JOURNALIST SAID THAT EVEN BEFORE\nTHE BARRY SCANDAL IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT THE BENNETT PLAN HAD\nBECOME \"ONLY A DIRTY BATTLE OF WORDS.\"  BENNETT'S STRATEGY FOR THE\nPREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN\nA TOTAL FAILURE.  BENNETT THEREFORE BELIEVES THAT THE BEST WAY TO\nCOVER HIS FAILURE IS TO TURN TOWARD LATIN AMERICA TO RELIEVE THE FURY\nOF HIS IMPOTENCE, ORDERING WARSHIPS AND PLANES TO CONTROL MARITIME AND\nAIR TRAFFIC.  AS USUAL, THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THE \"BACKYARD\" HAVE TO\nPAY FOR THE MISTAKES OF U.S. POLICY.\n\n   THIS IS NOT A STORY OF SUSPENSE.

IN FACT, CHILEAN BUSINESSMAN CARLOS\nCARDOEN WAS ALREADY SELLING \"CLUSTERS\" (PRECEDING WORD IN ENGLISH) TO\nIRAQ. DOING BUSINESS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE TWO SIDES CONFRONTING EACH\nOTHER IN THE LONG PERSIAN GULF WAR WAS NOT CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE.\n\n   THE DEAL, HOWEVER, WAS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THERE COULD BE MILLIONS\nOF DOLLARS IN PROFITS. COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL AND THE USSR WERE KNOWN\nTO BE SELLING WEAPONS TO BOTH IRAN AND IRAQ. THE USSR WAS DIRECTLY\nSELLING WEAPONS TO IRAQ AND SUPPLYING IRAN THROUGH MIDDLEMEN. CHILE\nKNEW OF A SIMILAR EXAMPLE: DURING THE BEAGLE CHANNEL CONFLICT, WHICH\nALMOST ENDED IN A WAR WITH ARGENTINA, ISRAEL SOLD MISSILES TO BOTH\nSIDES.\n\n   THEREFORE, IN A CAREFULLY PLANNED OPERATION, FERRIMAR AND FAMAE\nWERE ABLE TO SELL CLUSTER BOMBS TO IRAN.\n\n   THE MIDDLEMAN WOULD BE FRENCHMAN BERNARD STROIAZZO, THE SAME PERSON\nWHO THREE YEARS LATER WOULD CAUSE THE \"IRAN-CORFO\" (PRODUCTION\nDEVELOPMENT CORPORATION) SCANDAL (HOY, NO. 655).\n\n   IT IS ONLY NOW THAT STROIAZZO'S HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC. AN\nENGINEER HIRED BY IRAN'S NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANY, HE SERVED AS A\nREPRESENTATIVE OF FERRIMAR AND FAMAE TO THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE\nSALE OF CLUSTER BOMBS IN 1986. AFTER TWO SHIPMENTS OF DEFECTIVE BOMBS,\nTHE IRANIANS DECIDED THAT THEY COULD CAUSE MORE CASUALTIES AMONG THEIR\nOWN MEN THAN AMONG ENEMY TROOPS. STROIAZZO WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE FOR 18\nMONTHS.\n\n   HE MANAGED TO LEAVE AND TRAVELED TO CHILE. WITH THE HELP OF CNI\n(NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER) DIRECTOR BRIGADIER GENERAL HUGO SALAS,\nHE CONTACTED CORFO OFFICIALS WHO HELPED HIM ARRANGE COMPENSATION. HE\nARRANGED A PRELIMINARY ACCORD FOR ESTABLISHING A TOXIC WASTE RECYCLING\nPLANT IN CHILE, BUT THE DEAL FAILED. HE THEN FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST\nCORFO IN THE 19TH CIVIL COURT OF SANTIAGO.  CORFO HAS NOT YET BEEN\nNOTIFIED OF THE LAWSUIT. THE PROBLEM, AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE TOXIC\nWASTE PLANT IS CONCERNED, WILL BE INHERITED BY THE NEW GOVERNMENT --\nWHICH WILL TAKE OVER ON 11 MARCH -- AND BY CORFO.\n\n   DID FERRIMAR LIE TO THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT?\n\n   THIS ENTERPRISE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE GOOD CONTACTS WITH THE\nAUTHORITIES. AMONG THE PARTNERS OF FERRIMAR OWNER ALDO PESCE WERE\nRETIRED GENERAL MANUEL CONTRERAS SEPULVEDA, FORMER CHIEF OF THE\nNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, DINA; GENERAL RAUL REYES, FAMAE\nDIRECTOR, AND COLONEL CARLOS CARRENO, WHO WAS A FAMAE EXECUTIVE AND AN\nADVISER TO FERRIMAR ON THE PRODUCTION OF THE \"WASP\" BOMBS. (A LAWSUIT\nFILED WITH THE 14TH CRIMINAL COURT OF SANTIAGO UNDER \"ROBBERY OF\nINDUSTRIAL SECRETS\" CHARGES CLAIMS THAT THE BOMBS WERE BUILT WITH\nPLANS STOLEN FROM CARLOS CARDOEN BY ONE OF CARDOEN'S TRUSTED MEN.)\n\n   TO EXPORT ITS BOMBS, FERRIMAR NEEDED THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE\nDEFENSE AND FOREIGN MINISTRIES. THE COMPANY HAD TO PROVIDE WHAT IS\nKNOWN IN THE INTERNATIONAL WEAPONS MARKET IS KNOWN AS AN \"END-USER\nCERTIFICATE\" OR \"FINAL-USER CERTIFICATE.\" FERRIMAR GOT ONE. IT WAS\nSIGNED IN AUGUST 1985 BY A NIGERIAN ARMY OFFICER WHO, ACCORDING TO\nSOURCES CLOSE TO THE CASE, HAD RETIRED A LONG TIME AGO. A \"TRIANGLE\nOPERATION\" WAS CARRIED OUT TO CONCEAL THE TRUE OPERATION. IT IS NOT\nKNOWN WHETHER THE DEFENSE MINISTRY HAS INDICTED ANYONE OVER THE\nDECEPTION BY WHICH IT WAS VICTIMIZED.\n\n   AT THE END OF JANUARY 1986, THE FIRST 100 BOMBS WERE SHIPPED BY\nPLANE TO BANDAR ABBAS AIRPORT IN IRAN. EACH BOMB WEIGHED 227 KG AND\nCONTAINED 248 AMMUNITION PACKAGES, SOME OF THEM FOR IMMEDIATE\nDISCHARGE AND OTHERS FOR DELAYED ACTION.  THESE WERE CAPABLE OF MINING\nLARGE AREAS FOR UP TO 72 HOURS AFTER A BATTLE.\n\n   THE FIRST SHIPMENT WAS WORTH $7 MILLION; $1 MILLION WAS FOR\nSTROIAZZO AND $1.5 MILLION WENT FOR THE COST OF THE BOMBS. THE PRICE\nOF THE BOMBS ABROAD WAS $14,000 EACH, BUT THEIR REAL COST WAS ONLY\n$3,000. THE CHILEAN CONTACT IN THIS OPERATION, FERNANDO PEREZ, WAS TO\nHAVE RECEIVED $4.5 MILLION.\n\n   A TEST WAS PERFORMED IN IRAN AND THE BOMBS DID NOT WORK. THE\nIRANIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY ASKED THAT NEW TESTS BE CARRIED OUT IN CHILE.\n(CONTINUED)", "dateline": "SANTIAGO, 5 FEB 90 (HOY)", "char_before": 2340418, "source": "UNISYS", "char_end": 2345759}

WE SPENT EIGHT OR\nNINE YEARS FIGHTING THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDC) AND JOSE\nNAPOLEON DUARTE.  WE REMEMBER (WORDS INDISTINCT) THE ASSASSINATION OF\nHERBERT ANAYA SANABRIA.  HOWEVER, WHEN DUARTE DIED, A COMMUNIQUE WAS\nISSUED DECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT THE FUNERAL COULD TAKE PLACE\nPEACEFULLY.  HOW SHOULD WE VIEW ALL OF THESE APPARENT CHANGES OF\nPOSITION BY THE FMLN?\n\n   (SANCHO) AS FOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WE HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT\nADDITION TO BEING A POLITICAL FORCE, THE FMLN HAS HUMAN SENSITIVITY.\nWE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO TAKE THIS HUMANE ACTION BY\nDECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT MR. DUARTE COULD BE BURIED.  WE ALSO HAVE TO\nMENTION THAT THE PDC AND ALL OF THE LEFTIST FORCES OF THE COUNTRY CAN\nCONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE DEPOLARIZATION OF SOCIETY.  THE TRUCE WAS A\nGESTURE, IT WAS TO MAKE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SEE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE\nTO DEPOLARIZE SOCIETY AND THAT EACH OF US CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION.\n\n   THAT IS WHY WE INSIST THAT ONE MUST NOT RETURN TO ONE'S ELECTORAL\nOR POLITICAL HEGEMONIC PLANS, BECAUSE THAT WOULD OBSTRUCT THE UNITY OF\nTHE PEOPLE, WHICH IS NEEDED TO ISOLATE THE FASCISTS.\n\n   (REPORTER) COMMANDER, THERE WAS A DISCUSSION AT THE LEGISLATIVE\nASSEMBLY WHEN DUARTE DIED BECAUSE THE PDC LEGISLATORS MOTIONED TO NAME\nHIM THE FATHER OF DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN THESE TWO POLITICIANS?\n\n   (SANCHO) WE BELIEVE THAT DUARTE WAS A FIGHTER FOR DEMOCRACY.  HE\nHAD HIS OWN BELIEFS, HE HAD HIS OWN PERSONALITY, AND HE REALLY HAD\nCHARISMA; WE CANNOT DENY THAT.  OF COURSE, WE CANNOT COMPARE HIM TO A\nCRIMINAL WHO IS BEING SOUGHT BY JUSTICE.  I WOULD SAY THAT D'AUBUISSON\nIS A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE, WHO HAS SOUGHT SHELTER FROM HIS IMMUNITY\nAS A DEPUTY.  HIS IMMUNITY AS A DEPUTY DOES NOT PRECLUDE HIS CRIMES.\nTHERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN DUARTE AND (WORDS INDISTINCT) WHO IS\nWELL-KNOWN, BUT IS VIOLENT AND UNPOPULAR.\n\n   (REPORTER) TO END THE FIRST PART OF THE INTERVIEW, ARE YOU\nOPTIMISTIC ABOUT A POSSIBLE CONCERTED EFFORT BY POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC\nFORCES IN THE COUNTRY OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EACH WILL GO HIS OWN WAY.\nARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A CONCERTED EFFORT?\n\n   (SANCHO) A CONCERTED EFFORT IN A POLITICAL STRUGGLE OF ALL THE\nFORCES IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD NOT ONLY BE SEEN AS A POSSIBILITY, BUT\nMUST BE SEEN AS A POLITICAL NECESSITY FOR THE UNITY OF ALL POPULAR AND\nNATIONAL SECTORS, BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY FORMULA TO REBUILD\nTHE COUNTRY, TO REUNITE THE COUNTRY, AND TO RECONCILE THE COUNTRY.\nTHIS CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH A CONCERTED POLITICAL EFFORT.

SUBSEQUENTLY, THERE WILL\nBE A PROCESS FOR DISARMAMENT AND DEMOBILIZATION, REFERRED TO AS THE\nTOTAL SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES IN THE AGREEMENT.  I BELIEVE THAT IT\nIS A MATTER OF REACHING AGREEMENTS.  WE, AS A GOVERNMENT, ARE INVOLVED\nIN THIS BECAUSE WE SEE THE SUFFERING OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE\nBELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT FAIR FOR THEM TO LIVE IN A CLIMATE OF VIOLENCE\nIN WHICH THERE ARE SO MANY KILLED, SO MUCH DESTRUCTION, AND SO MANY\nPROBLEMS.\n\n   AS A GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE ALWAYS ASKED: WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS\nBARRING THEIR RETURNING TO CIVILIAN LIFE?  THEY ARE THE ONLY GROUP\nTHAT HAS NOT JOINED THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  WHAT DO THEY\nWANT?

WE HAVE SAID THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTING AS ITS OWN ANY CONSENSUS\nREACHED BY THE PARTIES.  IN OTHER WORDS, AT LEAST YOUR REMARK ON THE\nGOVERNMENT IS NOT TRUE.

THEY THINK THAT, BECAUSE\nDIFFICULTIES HAVE ARISEN, BECAUSE THERE IS A NEW SITUATION IN THE\nCOUNTRY, AND BECAUSE THE VOLUME OF THE U.S. AID HAS DIMINISHED, THE\nCOUNTRY IS RAPIDLY TAKING STEPS THAT OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES\nHAVE ALREADY TAKEN, TO MEET WITH THE SO-CALLED CONSULTING GROUP FORMED\nBY THE LEADING WORLD CREDIT INSTITUTIONS AND REQUEST LARGE LOANS TO\nSTABILIZE THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.  THESE POLITICIANS TOLD ME THAT\nTHEY ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS WOULD IMPOSE A HEAVY BURDEN ON THE NEW\nGOVERNMENT, WHICH WOULD ASSUME OFFICE AFTER 1994.\n\n   (CRISTIANI) WELL, I THINK THE OPPOSITION POLITICIANS SHOULD TRY TO\nUNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF THE MEASURES, WHICH CERTAINLY ENTAIL A\nSACRIFICE FOR THE VARIOUS NATIONAL SECTORS, ARE RESPONSIBLY TAKEN\nBECAUSE OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  MANY PEOPLE\nWILL SAY IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO THIS OR THAT.  I WOULD ONLY LOOK AT\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH, EVEN WITHOUT THE\nDESTRUCTION AND VIOLENCE CAUSED BY AN IRREGULAR FORCE, SUCH AS THE\nFMLN, HAVE EXPERIENCED MUCH MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAN THOSE\nENCOUNTERED BY EL SALVADOR AT PRESENT.  WE WOULD ALSO ENCOUNTER THOSE\nPROBLEMS IF WE FAIL TO TAKE MEASURES.  NEARBY IS NICARAGUA, THE\nINFLATION RATE OF WHICH HAS REACHED 1,700 PERCENT, ITS FOREIGN DEBT IS\nENORMOUS, AND IT IS IMMERSED IN DRAMATIC PROBLEMS.  NO MEASURES WERE\nTAKEN IN DUE TIME IN BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA, ALTHOUGH THESE MEASURES\nWERE PAINFUL.  IF THEY ARE NOT TAKEN ON TIME, THEY WILL BE MUCH MORE\nPAINFUL LATER, BECAUSE EVENTUALLY SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE TO\nCHECK THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN CREATED.  AT THIS TIME, WE ARE\nTRYING TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY TO START ITS EFFECTIVE RECOVERY.  IT\nIS BASED ON THIS RECOVERY THAT WE WILL AVOID FOREIGN INDEBTEDNESS,\nWHICH FOR MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HAS BEEN AN EASY WAY OUT AND AN\nALTERNATIVE, WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE ACTED RESPONSIBLY CONCERNING\nECONOMIC PROBLEMS.

FRANKLY, AS I SAID, THIS CASE IS NOW IN\nTHE HANDS OF THE COURT.  THE JUDGE IS THE ONE WHO CAN ORDER FUTURE\nINVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CASE.  YOUR QUESTIONS RELATE TO DOUBTS AND\nCONCERNS THAT THE JUDGE HAS BEFORE HIM.  HE CAN SUMMON ANYONE TO\nTESTIFY.  I UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS ALREADY SUMMONED SOME TOP OFFICERS.\n\n   I CAN ONLY SAY THIS: YOU HAVE JUST MENTIONED A MEETING IN WHICH\nSUPPOSEDLY I WAS PRESENT.  YOU ALSO SAID THAT IT WAS AT THAT MEETING\nTHAT THE MURDER WAS PLANNED.  THERE IS MUCH SPECULATION, THEREFORE I\nTHINK THAT WE MUST REMAIN COOL-HEADED.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE ARE\nSPECULATING WHEN THEY SAY THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN, THIS COULD HAVE\nHAPPENED, OR THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  FOR EXAMPLE, SOME HAVE\nSAID THAT THERE IS A COVER UP, BUT COLONEL RIVAS HIMSELF WAS THE ONE\nWHO DISCOVERED WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME.\n\n   THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS, WHICH IS NATURAL.  HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT\nMEAN THAT ...(CHANGES THOUGHT) FOR EXAMPLE, I MADE A STATEMENT FOR THE\nPROGRAM \"60 MINUTES;\" I WAS INTERVIEWED FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF, BUT\nOBVIOUSLY MY REPLIES WERE NOT AIRED FOR SOME REASON.  HOWEVER, I SAID\nTHAT IT IS NO SECRET IN OUR COUNTRY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PEOPLE,\nA GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE, WHO FEEL THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER SOME OF\nTHE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE IN FACT LINKED TO THE FMLN.  THEREFORE, IN\nTHIS CASE, ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT WOULD HAVE\nTO BE INVESTIGATED.  WOULD THAT BE CALLED FOR?  WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IT\nIS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON SPECULATION.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, DURING THE INVESTIGATIONS -- CONDUCTED BY THE\nINVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS, AN AUXILIARY LEGAL ORGAN\n-- WE THOUGHT IT WAS CONVENIENT AT A GIVEN TIME, SINCE WE HAD ENOUGH\nEVIDENCE ON A GROUP OF PEOPLE WE BELIEVE COMMITTED THE CRIME, THAT THE\nCASE SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.\n\n   THEREFORE, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TODAY CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE\nCASE AND DECIDES WHETHER TO INTERROGATE SOMEONE OR NOT.  IF THERE IS\nANY DOUBT, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CAN ORDER THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE\nTHIS OR THAT.  WHETHER SOMEONE IS INTERROGATED BY A JUDGE OR BY THE\nCOMMISSION IS IRRELEVANT; THE JUDGE MUST DECIDE.  I BELIEVE THAT IN\nTHIS CASE THE JUDGE SHOULD INVESTIGATE.  AS I SAID BEFORE, I THINK\nTHAT THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THE HONOR COMMISSION\nWILL BE SUMMONED, AND THAT ANOTHER MAY BE SUMMONED AFTERWARD.\n\n   (REPORTER) COULD YOU TELL US IN ENGLISH.  YOU SAID THAT YOU DO NOT THINK\nTHAT IT IS NECESSARY, THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED THE JESUITS, AND IF\nYOU ARE GOING TO START INVESTIGATING PEOPLE, WHY NOT INVESTIGATE EVERYONE\nWHO HAS CRITICIZED THE JESUITS.  THE FACT REMAINS, HOWEVER, THAT NOT\nEVERYBODY IS IN A POSITION TO REPROVE THE JESUITS, NOT EVERYONE WAS IN THE\nMILITARY HIERARCHY, NOT EVERYONE WAS INVOLVED IN THE ALTO MANDO (PRECEDING\nWORDS IN SPANISH).  THERE ARE (WORD INDISTINCT) PEOPLE IN THE ALTO MANDO WHO\nARE KNOWN TO HATE THE JESUITS, WHO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE CRITICIZED THEM IN THE\nPAST.  WHY DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE CORRECT FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO BE\nINVESTIGATED DIRECTLY?\n\n   (CRISTIANI) FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD SAY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OFFICERS\nIN THE ARMED FORCES AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER, WHETHER LATELY OR EARLIER, THAT\nTHERE WAS A WIDESPREAD BELIEF OF SOME SORT OF PARTICIPATION BY THE\n...(CORRECTS HIMSELF) SOME OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WITH THE FMLN.  THIS IS NOT\nFOR US AT THIS POINT AND TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER IT IS TRUE OR UNTRUE.  IT IS\nSIMPLY SOMETHING THAT WAS BELIEVED OUT THERE, AND THEREFORE, IT IS UP TO THE\nJUDGE TO DECIDE WHETHER HE WILL ONLY INTERVIEW ONE PERSON WHO BELIEVED THIS,\nOR WHETHER HE IS GOING TO INTERVIEW MANY PEOPLE.\n\n   THERE HAS BEEN ALSO THE FACT THAT IT WELL COULD HAVE BEEN THE ACT\nOF THE FMLN, THE ACT OF INDIVIDUAL GROUPS.  THERE WERE ALSO\nSPECULATIONS AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THE ASSASSINATION WAS COMMITTED AS\nTO WHO COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME.  SO THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS THAT\nCOULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME, AND THEREFORE, THERE COULD BE OTHERS\nTHAT WE COULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE (WORD INDISTINCT) INVESTIGATING.

HIS KILLERS THOUGHT\nTHAT BY DROWNING OUT HIS VOICE THEY WOULD INTIMIDATE THE DEFENDERS OF\nFREEDOM OF SPEECH.\n\n   LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS KILLED EIGHT MONTHS AGO.  BY KILLING HIM,\nTHEY SOUGHT TO ASSASSINATE A HOPE OF RENOVATION AND CHANGE AND A DEEP\nCONVICTION FOR THE NEED TO RADICALLY TRANSFORM POLITICAL HABITS AND\nTHE CLIMATE OF CORRUPTION, IMMORALITY, AND INDIFFERENCE IN THE FACE OF\nCRIME.  THIS INDIFFERENCE LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF THE GREAT EVILS THAT\nARE CAUSING BLOODSHED IN THE COUNTRY.\n\n   BERNARDO JARAMILLO STRUGGLED FOR A PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC LEFT THAT\nREJECTED ARMED STRUGGLE AND THAT WANTED TO BUILD A MORE JUST SOCIETY.\nBY KILLING HIM, THE CRIMINALS SOUGHT TO BLOCK THE PATHS TO LEGITIMATE\nPROTEST WITHIN THE LAW.\n\n   CARLOS PIZARRO, THE LAST LINK IN THIS MACABRE CHAIN THAT INCLUDES\nSO MANY OTHERS, REPRESENTED THE POSSIBILITY FOR GUERRILLA GROUPS TO\nLAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN INSTITUTIONAL POLITICS, OR FOR WEAPONS\nTO BE REPLACED BY LEGAL INSTRUMENTS TO STRUGGLE FOR LEGITIMATE IDEALS.\nBY KILLING HIM IN A DASTARDLY AND COWARDLY MANNER YESTERDAY, THEY\nSOUGHT TO DESTROY THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION AND REINCORPORATION OF\nARMED GROUPS INTO CIVIL LIFE.\n\n   THE DEATH OF OUR COUNTRYMEN SHOULD NOT BE IN VAIN.  IT STRIKES DEEP\nIN OUR HEARTS.  IT AFFECTS THE SPIRIT PROFOUNDLY.  IT MUST, THEREFORE,\nAWAKEN THE NATIONAL CONSCIENCE, BECAUSE THOSE CRIMES ARE NOT MERELY\nVILE CRIMES AGAINST UNARMED GREAT MEN WHO BELIEVED IN THE STRENGTH OF\nIDEALS.  THESE HAVE BEEN CRIMES AGAINST OUR BASIC VALUES, AGAINST THE\nCLEAN IDEALS OF PROGRESS AND PEACE THAT THESE MEN REPRESENTED.  WE\nMUST NOT BE MISTAKEN.  THOSE WHO KILLED OUR LEADERS DID NOT EXTINGUISH\nTHE NOBLE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY GAVE THEIR LIVES.  THEIR VALUES WILL\nPREVAIL.  THEY ARE OUR VALUES.  THEIR HOPES STILL LIVE.  THOSE HOPES\nBELONG TO ALL COLOMBIANS.  THEIR DREAM WILL NEVER DISAPPEAR.  IT IS\nTHE DREAM WE ALL HAVE OF ATTAINING PEACE AND PROSPERITY.  THAT IS WHY\nI PRAISE WHAT ANTONIO NAVARRO SAID LAST NIGHT: \"I INVITE THE M-19 (19\nAPRIL MOVEMENT) TO CONTINUE WALKING ALONG THE PATH THAT PIZARRO\nCHARTED.  TERRORISM'S GOAL HAS BEEN TO CLOSE THE PATHS TO CHANGE,\nRENOVATION, AND REFORM.\n\n   OUR PATH, ON THE CONTRARY, IS TO MAKE PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC\nREVOLUTION VIABLE.  IT IS A REVOLUTION OF HOPE.  THIS DEEP CRISIS WILL\nNOT BE SOLVED BY RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON THE\nINSTRUMENTS OF DEMOCRACY, BUT BY UNITING EFFORTS OF ALL GOOD\nCOLOMBIANS TO REPAIR THE ROADS TO CHANGE, RENOVATION, AND REFORM.\n(CONTINUED)", "dateline": "BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1)", "char_before": 2595520, "source": "BOEING", "char_end": 2599300}

THIS COMMISSION CAN BY ITSELF\nPROPOSE NEW MEASURES TO REINFORCE THE ELECTORAL GUARANTEES IN VARIOUS\nAREAS.  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND THOSE IN CHARGE OF\nSECURITY WILL MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH OF THE POLITICAL\nCAMPAIGNS TO CONSIDER THE EXISTING PROTECTION MEASURES.  THE\nCOMMISSION MET WITH THE M-19 AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY AND WILL\nMEET WITH THE OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.\n\n   THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE\nPROTECTION FOR ALL OF THE CANDIDATES.

TWO YEARS AGO, THE\nGOVERNMENT PROPOSED A PLEBISCITE AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE CONGRESS A\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS BILL.  IN THIS WAY, THE GOVERNMENT\nINTERPRETED THE NATIONAL FEELING, WHICH DEMANDS A MORE EFFICIENT\nADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND EVEN MORE STRINGENT ANTITERRORIST\nMEASURES, FOR WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION.  THE\nGOVERNMENT ALSO ECHOED THE PEOPLE'S CALL FOR STRONGER INSTITUTIONS AND\nA MORE EFFICIENT AND REPRESENTATIVE CONGRESS.  COLOMBIANS KNOW THAT\nTHE CURRENT EVILS WILL BE DEFINITIVELY OVERCOME BY EXPANDING AND\nSTRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY EVEN FURTHER, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR\nTHE CITIZENS' PARTICIPATION IN THE DECISIONS THAT CONCERN THEM MOST.\n\n   I WANT TO REAFFIRM THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO DO\nEVEYTHING NECESSARY SO THAT IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS WE CAN PAVE THE WAY\nFOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.

THE SOLID-FUELED\nMISSILES CARRY THEIR FUEL (THAT BURNS) AND THE COMBURENT (THAT\nSUPPLIES THE OXYGEN TO TRIGGER THE COMBUSTION) ON A STICKY ROD, THE\nCOMBUSTION OF WHICH CANNOT BE REGULATED.  THE CAKE BURNS COMPLETELY\nONCE THE COMBUSTION STARTS.  THEREFORE, SOLID-FUELED MISSILES ARE\nDIFFICULT TO CONTROL ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MUCH SIMPLER AND CHEAPER.\nMOREOVER, THEY PUT UP WITH ROUGH HANDLING AND CAN BE EASILY FIRED.\nTHE MILITARY PREFER THIS TYPE FOR MANUFACTURING SHORT-RANGE MISSILES.\n\n   THE LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES CARRY THE FUEL AND THE COMBURENT IN\nCOMPLETELY SEPARATE TANKS.  THE TWO ELEMENTS MEET IN A COMBUSTION\nCHAMBER WHERE THEY IGNITE AFTER TRAVELLING THROUGH PIPES.  VALVES MAKE\nIT POSSIBLE TO REGULATE THE POWER OF THE ENGINE.  GROUND PERSONNEL ARE\nABLE TO STOP THE ENGINE AND RESTART IT IN FULL FLIGHT, IN SHORT, TO\nCONTROL THE MISSILE AS THEY WISH THROUGH RADIO MESSAGES.\n\n   THE CRYOGENIC-FUELED MISSILES WERE DEVELOPED DURING THE 70'S AND\n80'S.  THEY CARRY HYDROGEN AND LIQUID GAS WHICH ARE LIGHTER THAN ANY\nOTHER PROPELLANT ELEMENT BUT WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO REFRIGERATE\nAND TO ISOLATE.  THIS TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD VERY FAST\nVEHICLES BECAUSE OF THEIR POWER TO WEIGHT RATIO.\n\n   THEY ARE USED TO PLACE HUGE COMMUNICATION SATELLITES IN SPACE SOME\n36,000 KM ABOVE THE EQUATOR, OR TO ATTACK A CITY FROM THE OTHER SIDE\nOF THE WORLD.\n\n   LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES REPRESENT THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED DURING\nTHE 50'S AND 60'S AND, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, EXPLAINS SOVIET LEADERSHIP\nIN SPACE RESEARCH.  THESE OLD, HEAVY, CUMBERSOME, AND UNBREAKABLE\nMISSILES DO NOT HAVE FRAGILE EQUIPMENT AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PLACE\nCARGO INTO OUTER SPACE AT A REASONABLE COST.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE\nLARGE FAMILY OF U.S. AND EUROPEAN CRYOGENIC- FUELED MISSILES CONTINUE\nAT AN EXPERIMENTAL STAGE AND ARE UNPREDICTABLE (AS THE CASE OF THE\nSPACE SHUTTLE AND THE ARIANE IV AND V).  MOREOVER, THEY ARE INCREDIBLY\nCOSTLY.\n\n   TOO POOR TO EVEN THINK OF DEVELOPING LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES, BRAZIL\nAND ARGENTINA HAVE TRIED TO PLACE SOLID-FUELED VEHICLES INTO ORBIT FOR\nDECADES.  THIS IS NOT ALL THAT EASY BECAUSE THESE MISSILES ARE REALLY\nLITTLE MORE THAN FLYING RODS (CANITAS VOLADORAS), BUT THE CASTOR,\nWHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY ARGENTINA IN 1978, THE SONDA IV DEVELOPED BY\nBRAZIL, AND THE JAPANESE LAUNCHING DEVICES DEVELOPED BY ISAS (A\nUNIVERSITY SPACE RESEARCH AGENCY) HAVE PROVED TO BE REASONABLY\nMANAGEABLE BEASTS.\n\n   THE CASTOR REPRESENTED THE PHASE PREVIOUS TO DESIGNING A SPACESHIP\nAND THIS MUST BE THE REASON WHY IT MYSTERIOUSLY DIED IN 1978 AFTER A\nSERIES OF INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL TESTS AND AFTER HAVING ALLOWED US TO\nREACH AN AGREEMENT FOR A \"JOINT-VENTURE\" WITH THE FRG TO STUDY THE\nATMOSPHERE.  THE ABSENCE OF MISTAKES BY A DEBTOR COUNTRY MAY BE FATAL.\n\n   WHEN ARGENTINA ONCE AGAIN STARTED TO DISCREETLY THINK ABOUT OUTER\nSPACE (1982/83), IT ALREADY HAD ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO CONSIDER LARGER\nPROJECTS.  IN FACT, WITH ITS ONE METER DIAMETER TUBE, THE CONDOR COULD\nPLACE A 200 KG CARGO IN A LOW POLAR ORBIT OF ONLY 200 KM.\n\n   THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ARGENTINA TO HAVE ONE OR MORE PAIRS\nOF EYES IN SPACE SO THAT COULD ASSESS ITS NATURAL RESOURCES, PREDICT\nTHE WATER FLOW OF RIVERS ON WHICH HYDROELECTRIC DAMS COULD BE BUILT,\nDETERMINE WHERE IT COULD FIND OIL AND URANIUM, AND CHEAPLY STOP\nILLEGAL FISHING ON THE CONTINENTAL PLATFORM.  THIS POSSIBILITY COULD\nNOT BE ACCEPTED BY SOME PEOPLE.\n\n   BRAZIL, WHICH IS LESS HARD UP, IS ABOUT TO PROGRESS FROM THE SONDA\nIV TO THE SONDA V AND HAS OPENLY INVITED US TO JOINTLY DEVELOP THE\nSPACESHIP.  WHAT WILL ARGENTINA ANSWER?  \"WE WILL\"?  OR WILL IT HAVE A\nCHAUVINIST ATTITUDE?  WHAT A PITY IT DID NOT ADOPT THAT ATTITUDE NOW\nTHAT IT IS LETTING THE CONDOR PROJECT DIE IN ITS FIRST STAGE -- IT WAS\nNEVER TESTED -- WHEN THE PRESSURE IS NOT AS GREAT AS IT HAS BEEN.\nWORST OF IT ALL IS THAT IT IS NOT RECEIVING ANYTHING IN EXCHANGE.\n\n   VERY WELL THEN, IT IS ACCEPTED, THE CONDOR WILL GO NO FURTHER.\nWHAT IS LEFT?  VERY LITTLE.  SHOULD WE DEVELOP SATELLITES EXCLUSIVELY\nFOR SPACE RESEARCH TO DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE SUN, OR STUDY THE\nCOSMIC EXPLOSIONS OF X-RAYS.

THE YOUNG OFFICERS PROVIDE NO FURTHER DETAILS BUT MAKE SOME\nALLUSIONS TO MISSIONS CONDUCTED WHILE THEY DID THEIR DUTIES.\n\n   THE DOCUMENT SAYS THAT SOME OF THE SENIOR OFFICERS WHO ARE\nOBTAINING MONEY ILLEGALLY MUST STOP AND MENTIONS THE NAMES OF FORMER\nMILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE NOW LIVING AND ENJOYING THEIR WEALTH IN\nEXILE.  THE DOCUMENT SAYS THAT THE CONTRADICTION RAISED BY THE ABOVE\nIS THE LUCK OF SOME GENTLEMEN OFFICERS WHO, AT THE END OF THEIR\nSERVICE, LIVE ABROAD AND ENJOY THEIR POSITIONS WITHOUT ANY QUESTION.\nTHE DOCUMENT ASKS HOW SOME FORMER OFFICERS ARE ABLE TO LIVE SO WELL\nWHEN WE KNOW THEY GRADUATED FROM OUR MILITARY ALMA MATER.\n\n   THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IS ALSO EXAMINED IN THEIR LETTER.\nTHEY NOTE THAT THE IDENTITY OF THE CULPRITS BECAME KNOWN SHORTLY AFTER\nTHE MURDER, BUT SOME OF THE SENIOR OFFICERS WITHHELD IMPORTANT\nINFORMATION FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND ARMED FORCES\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF.  A FEW HOURS AFTER THE MURDER, MANY OF US\nSUSPECTED WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  WE, THE YOUNG OFFICERS, HAVE THE BEST\nSOURCES OF INFORMATION AND MANY OF US DID NOT THINK THAT THE CASE\nWOULD HAVE ANY MAJOR IMPACT BECAUSE THE ACTIVISM OF THE PRIESTS WITH\nTHE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL FRONT (FMLN) WAS WELL-KNOWN.  HOWEVER,\nTHERE WAS CAUSE FOR CONCERN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CRIME BECAME\nKNOWN.  THE PRIESTS' MURDER WAS DESCRIBED AS IRRATIONAL AND SENSELESS\nBECAUSE OPEN FIGHTING AGAINST TERRORISM IS ONE THING AND THE STRUGGLE\nAGAINST THE IDEOLOGISTS IS ANOTHER.\n\n   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC MADE UP THE STORY ABOUT THE\nFMLN HATCHING A PLOT TO MURDER THE SAN SALVADOR BISHOPS IN AN ATTEMPT\nTO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE KILLING OF THE PRIESTS, THE LETTER\nSAYS.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COULD NOT BE REACHED FOR COMMENT ABOUT\nTHIS. AS STATED BY THE YOUNG OFFICERS, WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S\nIDEA WAS RAISED, IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE CREDIBLE.\nTHIS WAS TREATED AS A CHILDISH AND ILLOGICAL WAY OUT.  THE GROSS LIE\nMADE UP BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS NEVER CONSIDERED A PRACTICAL\nOPTION, THE DOCUMENT SAYS.\n\n   THE SELF-STYLED DOMINGO MONTERROSA LIVES MOVEMENT HAS SENT THE\nLETTER TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, THE ASSEMBLY, AND THE ARMED\nFORCES HIGH COMMAND, ASKING THEM TO MEASURE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE\nPOSITION ASSUMED BY THE U.S. EMBASSY AND VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE\nCOUNTRY REGARDING MILITARY AID.  THE YOUNG OFFICERS HAVE TAKEN THE\nNAME OF THE CHARISMATIC OFFICER WHO DIED WHEN HIS HELICOPTER WAS\nATTACKED WHILE FLYING OVER THE AREA OF CACAOPERA, IN THE NORTHERN PART\nOF THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN REGION.\n\n   IN THEIR EXTENSIVE DOCUMENT THE YOUNG OFFICERS ASK PRESIDENT\nCRISTINI NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY REPORTS FROM THE HIGH COMMAND MEMBERS\nOF LA TANDONA (NAME GIVEN TO 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS\nMILITARY ACADEMY).", "dateline": "SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL)", "char_before": 2644279, "source": "BOEING", "char_end": 2648847}

IN NO DEMOCRACY\nCAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE DICTATE ORDERS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  THE\nSAME HAPPENS IN THE UNITED STATES AS IN ANY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.\nI BELIEVE THAT AS FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE -- ALTHOUGH THERE IS\nMUCH URGENCY IN SEEING THIS TRIAL COMPLETED; THERE ARE GREAT\nEXPECTATIONS -- THAT THE JUDGE IS DUTY BOUND TO CONTINUE WITH THE\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES STIPULATED BY SALVADORAN LAW.\"  HE POINTS OUT THAT\nTHE PROSECUTION OF GENERAL NORIEGA IN THE UNITED STATES IS ALSO TAKING\nA LONG TIME.\n\n   REGARDING A REPORTED FMLN ATTACK ON HIS RESIDENCE IN SAN SALVADOR\nYESTERDAY, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE PERSON WAS WHO\nREPORTED AN ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE, EITHER THE OFFICIAL\nOR THE PRIVATE ONE.  NEITHER OF THEM WAS ATTACKED, THOUGH THERE COULD\nHAVE BEEN SOME INFORMATION THAT SUCH AN ATTACK WAS EXPECTED.  AN FMLN\nCOLUMN WAS DISPERSED IN AREAS CLOSE TO THE TWO RESIDENCES.\"\n\n   QUESTIONED ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON THE GOVERNMENT OF A POSSIBLE CUT IN U.S.\nGOVERNMENT AID TO EL SALVADOR, CRISTIANI RESPONDS:  \"WELL, I THINK THAT\nFIRST OF ALL, THE EFFECTS OF A REDUCTION OR CUT OF AID WOULD BE TWOFOLD.\nFIRST, I THINK IT WOULD BE A NEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE\nOBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE\nPROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED; AND THAT A CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY\nSOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING\nOF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT, THEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY\nVICTORY IS NOW CLOSER.  AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO END THE\nCONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL DIALOGUE.  SECOND, OBVIOUSLY\nTHE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE\nDEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND WILL NOT STANDBY WITH A WEAKENED\nDEFENSE.

IT\nIS A JUSTIFICATION THAT IS NOT VERY JUSTIFIABLE, I WOULD SAY.  I\nBELIEVE THE EVENTS ON 1 MAY IN THE MORNING CAN CLEARLY BE UNDERSTOOD.\nALL GROUPS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE WERE ABLE TO MARCH PEACEFULLY.\nTHEIR FREEDOMS ARE NOT BEING REPRESSED. I IMAGINE YOU HAVE ALL HEARD\nAND SEEN WHAT THEY SAID AND DID AND THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS.  I FEEL\nTHAT THIS WAS A WAY TO SEEK NOTORIETY THROUGH THE NEWS.  THIS COULD BE\nONE OF THE REASONS.  THE OTHER REASON COULD BE THAT THEY ARE HAVING\nPROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES.  WE HAVE INFORMATION TELLING US THAT THERE\nARE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE DIFFERENT GROUPS.

I FEEL THAT AT THIS STAGE OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, THEIR\nACTIONS ARE COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIABLE.  THAT IS NOT ALL.  THEY HAVE\nEVEN VIOLATED WHAT THEY HAVE CALLED UNILATERAL GESTURES MADE IN THE\nPAST.

SOME GROUPS HAVE ASKED TO BE\nINCLUDED IN THE DELEGATION.  I BELIEVE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE\nDIFFERENT GROUPS IS STIPULATED IN THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS.  WE HAVE\nALREADY EXPLAINED HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN ALLOW FOR THE PARTICIPATION\nOF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO\nCHANGE THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF GOVERNMENT\nOFFICIALS FOR THE MOST PART.

PRESIDENT, OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS WE HAVE LEARNED\nABOUT THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VARIOUS\nGARRISONS AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  SINCE YOU ARE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF\nOF THE ARMED FORCES, DO YOU SUPPORT THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PUBLISHED,\nWHICH CONDEMNED THE STATEMENTS MADE BY COL. SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ?\n\n   (CRISTIANI) CONCERNING THAT SITUATION, I HAVE SAID THAT SEVERAL\nPEOPLE HAVE MADE STATEMENTS, NOT JUST ONE.  THERE HAS BEEN PUBLIC\nSPECULATION AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE ASSASSINATIONS OF THE\nJESUIT PRIESTS AND THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT.  IF\nSOMEONE HAS ANY INFORMATION TO CONTRIBUTE, AND IF THAT SOMEONE IS\nREALLY INTERESTED IN THE PROGRESS OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY, HE\nSHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE TO GIVE HIM THE INFORMATION.  HE SHOULD NOT\nCONTINUE TO SPECULATE IN PUBLIC, BECAUSE IT CONFUSES PEOPLE AND IT\nOBSTRUCTS THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.\n\n   I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT NOT LONG AGO A\nDELEGATION OF SPANISH LEGAL EXPERTS VISITED THE COUNTRY AND THEY WERE\nPLEASED TO SEE HOW THE 4TH CRIMINAL JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE JUDICIAL\nPROCESS, AS OPPOSED TO OTHER REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE\nUNITED STATES.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD SPECULATE IN\nPUBLIC AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED.  IF SOMEONE HAS INFORMATION OR\nEVIDENCE, HE SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE, OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE\nCONFUSION.  IN THAT REGARD, I BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES\nCOMMANDERS' REJECTION OF COL. OCHOA'S STATEMENTS IS JUST THAT.  IN\nMANY OF THE STATEMENTS THEY WROTE -- I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN DRAFTING\nTHE STATEMENT -- THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT AND\nSTRENGTHEN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS, BUT THEY CANNOT COME OUT IN PUBLIC\nWITH SPECULATION BECAUSE THEY WOULD ONLY CONFUSE PEOPLE.

PRESIDENT, WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S.\nGOVERNMENT'S MILITARY AID, HAS YOUR GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SEEKING MILITARY AID IN OTHER COUNTRIES ON THIS\nCONTINENT OR FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD?  FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT\nA COUNTRY LIKE ISRAEL HAS GIVEN MILITARY AID TO CENTRAL AMERICAN\nCOUNTRIES.  HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT POSSIBILITY?\n\n   (CRISTIANI) I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT, YES, CERTAINLY, THE\nGOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS THE DUTY OF DEFENDING THE SYSTEM AND\nTHE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, AND -- REGARDLESS OF WHAT MAY\nHAPPEN, AND WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT OCCUR -- IF THAT HAPPENS, WE WILL\nALWAYS HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATE RESOURCES FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE\nCOUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  A FEW DAYS AGO I LISTENED TO\nSTATEMENTS BY SOME POLITICIANS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER SECTORS, WHO\nCOMPLAINED BECAUSE I SAID: WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEFENDING THE\nDEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, WE HAVE TO FIND THE RESOURCES, AND THERE ARE\nOTHER ALTERNATIVES TO GET RESOURCES FOR THE NATIONAL DEFENSE.  THOSE\nPOLITICIANS SAID IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS TO AFFECT SOCIAL PROGRAMS TO\nHELP THE NEEDY.  THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT THOSE POLITICIANS SHOULD THINK\nABOUT WHEN THEY ASK FOR A REDUCTION IN AID.  I BELIEVE THAT IS\nSOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT NEGLECT.  THE GOVERNMENT MUST DEFEND\nTHE SYSTEM FROM POSSIBLE ATTACKS -- THROUGH VIOLENCE TO REACH POWER --\nWHICH HAS BEEN TERMED BY CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MANY\nCOUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS ILLEGAL.\n\n   (LOHMAN) HAVE YOU CONSIDERED (WORDS INDISTINCT)\n\n   (CRISTIANI) ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE ARE TAKING INTO\nCONSIDERATION SOME ALTERNATIVES.

ON THE FIRST HAND, I THINK IT WOULD BE A\nNEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE OBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END\nTO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED, AND THAT\nA CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF\nTHE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT,\nTHEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY VICTORY IS NOW CLOSER.

A FEW MOMENTS AGO, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI TERMED THE\nMOST RIDICULOUS COMMUNIQUE HE HAD EVER HEARD FROM THE FMLN THE ONE IN\nWHICH THEY JUSTIFIED YESTERDAY'S MILITARY ACTIONS.  HE TERMED THEM\nPROPAGANDA-ORIENTED.  WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, HOW DO\nYOU VIEW THIS?\n\n   (UNGO) IN MY OPINION, THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE HAS ASPECTS THAT ARE\nINTERESTING AND OTHERS WHICH I THINK ARE NOT VALID.  THE TIME AND\nOPPORTUNITY OF THAT ACTION IS AMBIVALENT.  I THINK IT HAS NEGATIVE\nEFFECTS, AS WELL AS POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR THEM.  THERE IS ALWAYS THE\nFAMOUS VICIOUS CIRCLE WHEREIN IF THE FMLN CEASES TO ACT MILITARILY, IT\nIS BAD FOR THE FMLN BECAUSE IT SHOWS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.  IF IT ACTS\nMILITARILY IT IS ALSO BAD, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IT DOES NOT WANT\nPEACE.  IN THIS SENSE, I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT HAS EXHIBITED\nA SHOW OF FORCE, THAT ITS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN STRICTLY\nPROPAGANDA-ORIENTED OR WITH PROPAGANDA OBJECTIVES.  IT DOES NOT CEASE\nTO CREATE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS THAT GENERATE A NEGATIVE REACTION ON\nTHE OTHER'S PART, IF THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN AND TRY TO EASE\nCONFRONTATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND SEEK AN AGREEMENT AS MUCH AS\nPOSSIBLE.  I BELIEVE, AS I TOLD PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ON THE TELEPHONE\nYESTERDAY WHEN WE SPOKE OF OTHER THINGS BUT TOUCHED ON THIS TOPIC,\nTHAT I UPHOLD THE GOVERNMENT'S THESIS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS CRITICIZED THE\nFACT THAT WHEN NEGATIVE THINGS OCCUR, THEY ARE INVOKED TO SUSPEND A\nPROCESS WHICH IN OUR OPINION SHOULD BE CONTINUOUS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS\nUPHELD THE CONTINUITY OF THE DIALOGUE.  THE GOVERNMENT CRITICIZED THE\nFMLN WHEN ON TWO OCCASIONS IT SUSPENDED THE DIALOGUE DUE TO TERRORIST\nACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT OR SECURITY CORPS.  THE DIALOGUE\nAND NEGOTIATION PROCESS HAS SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THIS.  I BELIEVE\nTHAT IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE ITS OWN MEDICINE.  IT\nSHOULD MAINTAIN THE CONTINUITY OF THE PROCESS AND NOT USE AS A PRETEXT\nTHE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS TO TRY TO SEEK WAYS OF CONDITIONING OR\nPERTURBING A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION, WHICH INVOLVES NOT\nONLY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, BUT THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL\nFORCES AS WELL.\n\n   (REPORTER) DR. UNGO, IN THAT SENSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD ANNOUNCED\nTHROUGH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THAT THE DIALOGUE WOULD BE RESUMED ON 3\nMAY.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL'S ENVOY ANNOUNCED THAT IT\nWOULD BE THE FIRST PART OF MAY.  DON'T YOU THINK THAT TOO MUCH TIME IS\nBEING SPENT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO AGREE ON SUMMIT MEETINGS THAT WILL\nPERMIT SECURING AGREEMENTS?\n\n   (UNGO) I HAVE A VERY POSITIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW THE PROCESS IS\nDEVELOPING IN THIS FIRST PHASE, JUDGING BY THE CONDUCT ON THE PART OF\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN.  I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A DELAY, BUT I\nTHINK IT IS A DELAY THAT IMPROVES THE POSSIBILITIES AND CONDITIONS.\nAPPARENTLY THE TIMES WERE MARKED BY HASTE AND PRECIPITATION FOR THE\nFMLN TO PRESENT A PROPOSAL.  ALSO, THERE WAS A VERY SHORT TIME FOR THE\nGOVERNMENT TO PREPARE ITS RESPONSE AND HOLD A BILATERAL MEETING LATER.\nAT THE SAME TIME, IT LEFT A VERY NARROW MARGIN OF INFLUENCE TO THE\nPOLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HIMSELF CONVENED THE POLITICAL PARTIES TO\nEXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THE SITUATION WAS AND HOW HE VIEWED THE ROLE OF\nTHE PARTIES.  THE PARTIES HAVE THEIR OWN CONCEPT OF THEIR ROLE AND\nHAVE BEEN WORKING ARDUOUSLY AND RESPONSIBLY.  IN TWO WEEKS THEY HELD\nFOUR PROLONGED, HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS, TWO PER WEEK.

THE SOURCE, WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, ADDED\nTHAT \"PINOCHET IS AWARE OF THE FEAR HE AWAKENS AND HE USES IT\nADROITLY.\"\n\n   THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL NOT ATTEND THE TODAY'S CEREMONY IN\nCONGRESS ALTHOUGH THE COMMANDERS OF THE OTHER ARMED FORCES BRANCHES,\nTHE VERY SAME ONES THAT DID NOT SUPPORT HIS ATTEMPT TO CONVOKE THE\nNATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WILL BE PRESENT.\n\n   PINOCHET CLAIMED THAT HE HAS \"INSTITUTIONAL REASONS\" FOR HIS\nABSENCE AND HAS LEFT FOR NORTHERN CHILE WHERE HE IS CURRENTLY TOURING\nARMY GARRISONS.\n\n   ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT THE \"PINOCHET EFFECT\" WILL BE NOTICEABLE IN\nAYLWIN'S SPEECH THROUGH GREATER MODERATION IN ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW\nINSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AND THROUGH MORE BENIGN ASSESSMENTS OF THE\nPREVIOUS MILITARY REGIME.", "dateline": "SANTIAGO, 21 MAY 90 (EFE)", "char_before": 2737635, "source": "BOEING", "char_end": 2742820}

TERRORIST\nACTIONS HAVE BROUGHT SADNESS AND MOURNING TO DOZENS OF OUR POOR HOMES,\nAS WELL AS TO FAMILIES OF NATIONAL LEADERS.  COLOMBIA'S ENEMIES HAVE\nDEDICATED THEMSELVES TO ATTACKING UNARMED CITIZENS.  THEIR INSANE\nACTIONS ARE ENDING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND HONEST\nCOLOMBIANS.  AT THESE TRYING TIMES, I SEND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IRRATIONAL WAVE OF MONSTROUS CRIMES MY\nDEEPEST SENTIMENTS OF SOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TELL ALL THE VICTIMS'\nRELATIVES AND FRIENDS THAT WE SHARE THEIR SORROW AND SADNESS.\n\n   THE COUNTRY AND ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN DEALT A STRONG BLOW\nTODAY.  ANOTHER GREAT MAN HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED.  LIBERAL LEADER\nFEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ WAS VIOLENTLY MURDERED IN THE STREETS OF\nMEDELLIN.  THE LOSS OF SENATOR ESTRADA VELEZ LEAVES THE LIBERAL PARTY\nAND ANTIOQUIANS WITHOUT ONE OF ITS GREAT LEADERS.  HE IS TO BE ADDED\nTO THE LIST OF MARTYRS THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THEIR THOUGHTS AND\nBRAVE ATTITUDE IN CONFRONTING THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS.  FEDERICO\nESTRADA WAS A FIGHTER IN THIS ADMINISTARTION AND, AS OUR COLOMBIAN\nAMBASSADOR TO ITALY, CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH\nTHAT COUNTRY AND WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.  THE COUNTRY RECALLS HIM\nFOR HIS RECENT ACTIONS AS THE PROPONENT AND PROMOTER OF THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS PROJECT AT THE SENATE.  HIS BRILLANT POLITICAL\nAND PROFESSIONAL CAREER ALLOWED HIM TO REACH THE HIGHEST POSITIONS OF\nTHE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS AND OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  HE WAS A SUPREME\nCOURT MAGISTRATE, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, PARLIAMENTARIAN, THE NATIONAL\nAND DEPARTMENTAL LEADER OF THE LIBERAL PARTY, A PUBLIC SERVANT OF MANY\nYEARS, AND A TIRELESS WORKER FOR THE WELLBEING OF THE PEOPLE OF\nANTIOQUA.  HIS LIFE WAS ENDED AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY AND HIS PARTY\nNEEDED HIS EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE.\n\n   TO HIS WIFE, HIS FOUR CHILDREN, HIS FOLLOWERS, AND ALL ANTIOQUEANS,\nI SEND A HEARTFELT MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE IN THE NAME OF ALL HIS FELLOW\nCOUNTRYMEN.  THE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THIS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.  ALL\nCOLOMBIANS GET ANGRY EACH TIME A BARBARIC ACT TAKES PLACE AND EACH\nTIME ONE OF OUR LEADERS IS MURDERED.  LET US TURN THIS ANGER INTO A\nPUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTIONS, IN A\nDECIDED ACTION BY ALL AGAINST THE EMPIRE OF CRIME, AND IN EFFECTIVE\nSOLIDARITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  RECOVERING PEACE AND\nTRANQUILLITY IS A JOINT TASK.  EVERY DAY WE MUST DEMAND MORE\nEFFICIENCY FROM OUR PUBLIC FORCES BUT WE MUST ALSO GIVE THEM MORE\nSOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN EFFICIENTLY COMPLY WITH THEIR\nSERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES.  THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DOING;\nIT HAS SUPPORTED THEM MORALLY AND MATERIALLY.\n\n   TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND IMPUNITY DEPENDS ABOVE ALL ON THE\nCOOPERATION OF CITIZENS.  WE MUST ALL BECOME LIKE SOLDIERS IN THE\nSEARCH FOR PEACE BECAUSE THE FUTURE OF OUR FAMILIES, OUR PRINCIPLES,\nOUR RIGHTS, AND OUR DEMOCRACY ARE AT STAKE.  LET THOSE WHO PROMOTE\nVIOLENCE FACE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY OF 30 MILLION HONEST COLOMBIANS.  NO\nONE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PAINFUL MOMENT THE COUNTRY IS\nENDURING.  THE INTERESTS OF COLOMBIA ARE ABOVE ALL OTHER\nCONSIDERATIONS.\n\n   ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE DECISION BY THE HONORABLE\nSUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND AFTER A\nTHOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RECENT PUBLIC ORDER DISTURBANCES, I HAVE\nDEEMED IT APPROPRIATE TO SEND THE FOREIGN MINISTER TO REPRESENT\nCOLOMBIA AT THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.\n\n   AS YOU ARE AWARE, THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BEGIN\nTOMORROW IN CUZCO, PERU.
