THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADOPTED AN\nIRRESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE AND HAVE BRAZENLY ACCUSED THE FMLN OF THE CRIMES\nTHEY COMMIT.\n\n   IN VIEW OF THIS ATTITUDE AND OF THE PEOPLE'S INDIGNATION, WE HAVE TO\nPREVENT OUR PRESENCE AT THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO COVER UP THE\nGOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS MASSACRE AND TO ENHANCE THE MASK OF\nMODERATOR AND NEGOTIATOR THAT CRISTIANI HAS BEEN USING TO SECURE POLITICAL\nSUPPORT AND U.S. FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO EXTEND THE WAR.\n\n   IN SAN JOSE, SPEAKING ON ITS VIEW OF THE WAR, THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT\nIT CONSIDERS POPULAR MOVEMENTS AS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FMLN, AND\nTHEREFORE, AS ENEMIES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE ARMED CONFLICT.\n\n   WE DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION GIVE US A LIST OF THOSE\nORGANIZATIONS, BUT TO NO AVAIL.

DURING THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, CHILEAN FOREIGN RELATIONS WERE\nDIVIDED INTO TWO PROCESSES. ON THE ONE HAND, AS THE DICTATORSHIP BECAME\nMORE AND MORE ISOLATED, IT WAS INCREASINGLY CONDEMNED IN INTERNATIONAL\nFORA AND REPUDIATED BY INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS\nMORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR A\nFREE CHILE AND GENEROUSLY GRANTED THEIR SOLIDARITY TO OUR CAUSE, OUR\nORGANIZATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES BECAME INCREASINGLY OPEN TO THE\nWORLD. THUS, THEY EXPANDED THEIR HORIZONS AND CONTRIBUTED THEIR\nEXPERIENCES.\n\n   2. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE PARTY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED ITS\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND ENHANCED ITS VISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL\nSITUATION. IT HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES'\nREVOLUTIONARY AND DEMOCRATIC CAUSE, AND IT HAS FULLY IMMERSED ITSELF IN THE\nGREAT DEBATES OF WORLD SOCIALISM. TO THESE DEBATES WE BROUGHT OUR VIEWS ON A\nPROFOUNDLY RENEWED LEFTIST SOCIALISM COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT,\nAND SOCIAL CHANGE.\n\n   3. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE PARTIES THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNATIONAL\nSOCIALIST (SI) AND WITH THE SI ORGANIZATION ITSELF HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITHIN\nTHIS CONTEXT. THIS STRENGTHENING OF TIES HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF TWO THINGS.\nFIRST, IT IS BASED ON THE POSITION THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PRINCIPLES\nTHE SI HAS UPHELD REGARDING THE CHILEAN SITUATION. IN OCTOBER 1973, A FEW\nDAYS AFTER THE COUP, SI CHAIRMAN WILLY BRANDT CONDEMNED THE END OF THE\nCHILEAN DEMOCRACY AND PRESIDENT ALLENDE'S ASSASSINATION AT THE UN GENERAL\nASSEMBLY. AT THE TIME HE ALSO SAID THIS WAS A GREAT STEP BACKWARD FOR THOSE\nWHO ASPIRED TO ACHIEVE SOCIALISM THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. SINCE THEN, THE\nSI HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY MOBILIZED IN FAVOR OF CHILE BY MAKING THE CHILEAN\nCAUSE AND SALVADOR ALLENDE THE SYMBOLS OF ALL INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR\nDEMOCRACY AND CHANGE. IT IS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK OF INTEREST AND\nCOOPERATION THAT THE VOICE OF CHILEAN SOCIALISM HAS BEEN HEARD AND OUR IDEAS\nAND PROPOSALS PRAISED.\n\n   4. THE SECOND REASON STEMS FROM THE PROCESS OF EXPANSION AND\nTRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE SI IN THE PAST 2 DECADES. THE OVERALL\nPROCESS OF CHANGE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WORLD DURING THIS PERIOD -- THE\nTECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG NATIONS,\nEXPANSION OF COMMUNICATIONS, GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND MILITARY PROLIFERATION, THE\nEMERGENCE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS, THE\nWORSENING OF EXTREME POVERTY AND INTERNATIONAL INEQUALITIES, THE PROGRESS OF\nLIBERATION STRUGGLES IN THE THIRD WORLD, INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE\nVALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS -- HAS ALSO EFFECTED MAJOR CHANGES IN\nTHE IDEAS AND POSITIONS OF SOCIALIST PARTIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS\nFRAMEWORK, THE SI HAS EXPANDED ITS OUTLOOK, HAS INCREASINGLY RENEWED ITS\nIDEAS AND, ABOVE ALL, HAS ACCEPTED PLURALISM WITHIN ITS FOLD AS WELL AS A\nBROAD INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF AN\nAUTONOMOUS, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS DEBATE\nACQUIRED A DEMOCRATIC, ANTIFASCIST CONTENT AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR ROLE\nPLAYED BY SOCIALIST FORCES THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A LONG ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE.\n(CONTINUED)", "dateline": "SANTIAGO, 16 JUL 89", "char_before": 50844, "char_end": 54119}

ONE OF\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE\nCOMBINING OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH THE JUST ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND\nSOCIAL DEMANDS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT\nHAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THESE 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.  THESE DEMANDS\nARE RELATED TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION, THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN\nRIGHTS, THE DENUNCIATION OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, AND\nEFFORTS TO FIGHT IMMUNITY AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TRUTH REGARDING\nTORTURE, DISAPPEARANCES, AND ASSASSINATIONS. THESE QUESTIONS HAVE ONCE\nAGAIN COME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT NOW THAT MANY RIGHTIST CANDIDATES ARE\nDEMAGOGICALLY ATTEMPTING TO POSE AS DEFENDERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND\nSINCE EL MERCURIO HAS REPORTED THAT THE DICTATOR IS PLANNING TO\nCONVERT THE CNI (NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER) INTO AN AGENCY OF THE\nARMY SO THAT THE MAIN REPRESSIVE BODY FROM ALL THESE YEARS CAN BE\nUNDER HIS DIRECT CONTROL.

THE DISSOLUTION\nOF THE CNI HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE IMMENSE\nMAJORITY OF CHILEANS.\n\n   (BEGIN RECORDING) (ANNOUNCER) WHAT IS YOUR OPINION, JAIME INZUNZA,\nON THE DICTATOR'S INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THE CNI AS IT IS AND TO KEEP\nIT UNDER HIS DIRECT COMMAND?\n\n   (INZUNZA) I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS.  THE\nINTENTION IS TO MAINTAIN INTACT THE MAIN TERRORIST APPARATUS OF THE\nDICTATORSHIP, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST FLAGRANT\nVIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE.  I\nUNDERSTAND THAT THE DINA (NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, REPLACED\nBY CNI) AND THE CNI HAVE BEEN IN FACT A SINGLE APPARATUS AND THEREFORE\nTHE MAIN ORGANS OF STATE TERRORRISM OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS.  IF\nTRANSFERRED TO THE ARMY, THE CNI WOULD CONTINUE TO BE UNDER PINOCHET'S\nORDERS.  UNDER WHOSE ORDERS HAS IT BEEN ALL THESE YEARS?  FOR WHOM HAS\nIT BEEN A DIRECT AGENT ALL THESE YEARS?  HENCEFORTH IT WILL BE UNDER\nTHE CONTROL OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY.

THIS IS CLEAR: WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION FORCES\nWANT IS TO HAVE THE CULPRITS BEHIND THOSE CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS\nVIOLATIONS PROSECUTED, NOT THE MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE TRANSFER OF\nTHE CNI TO THE ARMY IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MEN IN UNIFORM ACT AS\nACCOMPLICES OR ACCESSORIES TO THOSE CRIMES.  LOYALTY IS NOT AT STAKE\nHERE; LOYALTY IS DEFENDING VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, NOT SOME SORT OF\nCRIMINAL COMPLICITY THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE TRAINING OF THESE\nMEN.

THIS\nIS THE LAST SCENARIO OF THE LAST CHAPTER IN WHICH THE FMLN (FARABUNDO\nMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) WILL ACHIEVE THE VICTORY OF THE\nPEOPLE.  WE CALL ON YOUR CONSCIENCE, YOUNG PATRIOTIC OFFICER.\n\n   JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBINGS OF ZACAMIL.  OVER 500\nHOMES WERE RAZED.  ARE YOU GOING TO ALLOW THE HIGH COMMAND TO FINISH\nOFF THE CITY, TO FINISH OFF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS\nWHERE YOUR RELATIVES MIGHT BE?  YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN ZACAMIL,\nMEJICANOS, SOYAPANGO.  PATRIOTIC OFFICER, IT IS TIME WE SIT DOWN TO\nTALK, TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR FATHERLAND, AND WHAT ARE WE GOING\nTO DO WITH LA TANDONA.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS WHO ARE LISTENING TO US: IT\nIS USELESS TO CONTINUE DEFENDING; TO CONTINUE DEFENDING WHAT, WE ASK\nYOU.  THE FATHERLAND?  WHAT FATHERLAND?

THESE ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE SOLDIERS\nFROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 AND THE CAVALRY.  COMBATS ARE ALSO\nREPORTED NORTH OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE 4TH AND 1ST\nINFANTRY BRIGADE.

THE SOLDIERS ARE FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT\nNO. 6 OF SONSONATE.  TROOPS FROM SONSONATE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO SAN\nSALVADOR, BECAUSE THE HIGH COMMAND HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.\nIN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A MIXTURE OF SOLDIERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE\nCOUNTRY IN THE CAPITAL CITY.

THEY ARE\nCLASHING AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n\n   CLASHES ARE ALSO REPORTED WITH THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE 1ST\nINFANTRY BRIGADE IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE 4TH INFANTRY\nBRIGADE IS FIGHTING IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE\nINTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY?  THE GARRISONS HAVE BEEN LEFT EMPTY.  THE SAN\nFRANCISCO GOTERA GARRISON HAS BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ANYONE.  THE 4TH\nINFANTRY BRIGADE IS BEING LEFT BY ITSELF, AS WELL AS THE MILITARY\nDETACHMENT NO. 1.  THE COLONELS ARE DESPERATE AND ARE BRINGING TROOPS\nINTO THE CAPITAL CITY.\n\n   THIS IS A GOOD REPORT.  THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND MILITARY\nDETACHMENT NO. 6 ARE IN THE CAPITAL.

IN THIS AGGRESSION THE FMLN\nDISPLAYED ITS WEAPONRY.  IT DISPLAYED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS,\nWHICH....(CHANGES THOUGHT) BY THE WAY, IN RECENT DAYS THE SALVADORAN\nARMED FORCES HAVE BEGUN A NUMBER OF SEARCHES IN SOME HOUSES WHERE IT\nIS BELIEVED THAT SOME OF THESE WEAPONS WERE LOCATED. WE HAVE ALREADY\nFOUND LARGE AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS.\n\n   IN ADDITION, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AND HID BEHIND YOU,\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE.  IT USED YOU AS A SHIELD, WANTING TO CONVEY THE\nIDEA THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT THE\nPEOPLE HERE WOULD RISE UP TO SUPPORT THEM.  THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT\nTHIS VIEW IS TOTALLY FALSE.  FAR FROM SUPPORTING THE FMLN, THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE, SALVADORAN BROTHERS, SUPPORTED THE ARMED FORCES IN\nTHE TREMENDOUS EFFORT IT HAS CONDUCTED TO REPEL THE FMLN AGGRESSION.\n\n   HOWEVER, WE MUST NOW CONSIDER A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER.  IT IS\nIMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN AGGRESSION OF THIS SIZE WITHOUT SUPPORT\nFROM SOMEONE ABROAD.  ON THIS OCCASION, WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS\nSUPPORT CAME FROM NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA AND CUBAN PRESIDENT\nCASTRO, BUT CHIEFLY FROM ORTEGA WHO IS TRYING TO RAISE A SMOKESCREEN\nIN THE FACE OF THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT MRS VIOLETTA CHAMORRO MAY\nDEFEAT HIM IN THE ELECTIONS, AND BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE\nPUPPET OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST AGGRESSION IN WHICH ORTEGA AND\nCASTRO PARTICIPATE.  IF THIS IS NOT SO, LET US TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAS\nHAPPENED.  DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU WERE SUFFERING MOMENTS OF\nANGUISH LAST WEEK, YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LARGE NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS\nWHO WERE SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  WE HAVE ALSO MANAGED TO\nCOLLECT EVIDENCE THAT THE ORTEGA GOVERNMENT TRAINED FMLN FIGHTERS IN\nTHE USE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF WEAPONRY, SPECIFICALLY THE GRENADE\nLAUNCHERS.\n\n   WHAT HAPPENED?  IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE BEGAN NOTICING WHAT KIND\nOF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED.  IN THE FOILED ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL\nHOUSE, A SUBSEQUENT ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' JOINT\nCHIEFS OF STAFF, AND LASTLY, AN ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL GUARD GARRISON\nPARTICULAR KINDS OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED.  AS A RESULT OF THE\nSAVAGE ACTION BY FMLN, TWO LITTLE GIRLS WERE KILLED.  MOREOVER, LET US\nRECALL AND SEE THE CONNECTION THAT EXISTS WITH ALL THE SHIPMENTS THAT\nTHE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN STOPPING BETWEEN NICARAGUAN AND\nEL SALVADOR.  ONE SHIPMENT WAS MADE PRIOR TO THE VISIT WE PRESIDENTS\nMADE TO COSTA RICA.  IN THAT COUNTRY, WE DENOUNCED ORTEGA FOR\nCONTINUING TO SEND WEAPONS AND SUPPORTING THE FMLN IN AN OPEN\nVIOLATION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS.\n\n   AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED LATELY?  ON 25 NOVEMBER, SALVADORAN PEOPLE,\nTWO LIGHT AIRPLANES COMING FROM NICARAGUA WERE DISCOVERED.  THEIR\nFLIGHT COURSE INDICATES THAT THEY CAME FROM NICARAGUA, ESPECIALLY THE\nONE WHERE THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND.  AS ADDITIONAL PROOF, WE HAVE A\nDOCUMENT SHOWING THAT ONE LIGHT AIRCRAFT BELONGS TO THE SETA\nTRANSPORTATION COMPANY LOCATED IN NICARAGUA'S AUGUSTO CESAR SANDINO\nAIRPORT.  IT WAS BRINGING SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR THE FMLN.  IN\nTHAT AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT, FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED: THE PILOT WHO WAS\nWEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE WEARING MILITARY\nUNIFORMS; I MEAN CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS LIKE THE ONES WORN IN MANY\nCOUNTRIES, AND LIKE THE ONES THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCE USE.  IT IS\nBELIEVED THAT TWO OF THOSE PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT.\nWE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANOTHER PERSON KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD A\nWEAPON IN HIS HAND AND A BULLET WOUND IN FOREHEAD.

HOW DOES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CONCEIVE THIS HAPPENING?\n\n   (CRISTIANI) I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THIS\nPRESIDENTIAL MEETING AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MEETINGS.  TO EXPLAIN\nTHIS BETTER, MARCO ANTONIO, WE MUST SAY WE WILL NOT FALL INTO WHAT HAS\nBEEN USED IN THE PAST, THAT IS, THE FAMOUS SYMMETRY.  ON THIS\nOCCASION, WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL WHEN WE SAID THAT WE\nWERE NOT WILLING TO CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING SACRIFICES AND OTHER THINGS\nFROM THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE NICARAGUAN\nPROBLEM EXCLUSIVELY.  WE DEMANDED UNIFORMITY, AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY\nCONFRONTING THE AGGRESSION OF AN IRREGULAR FORCE -- ANY OTHER COUNTRY\nIN CENTRAL AMERICA -- ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED IN A UNIFORM\nMANNER, AS FAR AS MEASURES AND CRITERIA THAT MAY BE ADOPTED IN THE\nPRESIDENTIAL MEETINGS.\n\n   THAT IS WHY TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE SEEING HOW THE\nMEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE -- THAT HAD BEEN\nGRANTED MOST OF THE ATTENTION UP TO NOW -- ARE ALSO BEING ADOPTED FOR\nTHE FMLN.\n\n   WE CANNOT ALLOW A COUNTRY TO CLAIM IT IS THE ONLY TARGET OF AN\nAGGRESSION BY AN IRREGULAR ARMED FORCE SUPPORTED FROM ABROAD.  HERE IN\nEL SALVADOR WE NOW HAVE GREATER EVIDENCE FOLLOWING THIS 11 NOVEMBER\nTERRORIST AGGRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS A MOVEMENT THAT CAN SURVIVE ONLY\nWITH SUPPORT FROM ABROAD, AND THAT IT OBEYS AND EXISTS BECAUSE OF\nINTERNATIONAL MOVEMENTS.\n\n   IN THE SECOND PLACE, IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT ONLY HAS THE\nCAPACITY TO GENERATE TERRORISM, WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THIS\nDOCUMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE JUST TALKING ABOUT DEMOBILIZATION AND\nPACIFICATION IN NICARAGUA.  IT IS TIME TO APPLY THIS TO ALL IRREGULAR\nGROUPS, BE IT THE URNG (GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY) IN\nGUATEMALA, OR ANY OTHER IRREGULAR ARMED GROUP THAT MAY COME UP AND MAY\nTRY TO HINDER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE AREA.\n\n   WE SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE DEEP INTO THE MINDS OF ALL\nTHE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, AND FROM NOW ON, WE WILL HAVE GREATER\nUNIFORMITY IN TREATING ALL OF THOSE IRREGULAR GROUPS THAT OPERATE IN\nTHE REGION.\n\n   (MODERATOR) RENE HURTADO OF EL MUNDO.\n\n   (HURTADO) MR PRESIDENT, FOLLOWING THE TELA AND COSTA DEL SOL\nMEETINGS, NICARAGUA HAS CHANGED ITS STAND.  IN COSTA RICA, PRESIDENT\nORTEGA WAS ASKED IF HE HAD SOLD OUT THE FMLN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE\nDEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE SUMMIT IN FAVOR\nOF NICARAGUA.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS, AND ALSO\nHOW YOU INTERPRET THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT ORTEGA HAS ACCEPTED SOME\nISSUES ABOUT THE FMLN THAT HE DID NOT ALLOW IN TELA OR COSTA DEL SOL?\nON THE OTHER HAND, WILL THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN BE THE RESULT\nOF A DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS LATER ON?\n\n   (CRISTIANI) IN THE FIRST PLACE, I BELIEVE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA WAS\nUNABLE TO PULL ANY MORE TRICKS OUT OF HIS HAT, AND HE WAS FACING A\nFACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO IS SPREADING ARMED\nREVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER DEMOCRATIC\nPROCESSES IN THE REGION.  ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT HONORING\nTHE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE\nCOMMITMENTS.  ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLE\nDEFENSE.\n\n   THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPT\nTHE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELF\nTOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.\nTHIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES IN\nPOLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS.", "dateline": "SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN)", "char_before": 162878, "char_end": 166705}

THE MAIN REASON IS THE\nVERY COMPLICATED PREDICAMENT IN WHICH OUR OFFENSIVE HAS PLACED\nCRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  AS YOU WILL REMEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT\nHAS MET WITH MUCH INTERNATIONAL DISREPUTE AND ISOLATION BECAUSE OF THE\nBRUTAL ASSASSINATION OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE BOMBING OF THE CIVILIAN\nPOPULATION.  LET US RECALL, AS A SIGNIFICANT FACT, THAT THE UNITED\nNATIONS HAS CONDEMNED THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ALL IT HAS DONE,\nESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LATEST ATROCITIES.  ON THAT OCCASION, EL\nSALVADOR WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT VOTED AGAINST THAT RESOLUTION WHILE\n96 COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOR.\n\n   WE MENTION THIS CASE AS A MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE, BUT THE FACT IS\nTHAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION THAT THE\nDICTATORSHIP HAS FOUND ITSELF IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION.  THIS\nWAS A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE NORTH AMERICANS.\n\n   TO WHOM COULD THEY TURN AT A TIME WHEN ALL INTERNATIONAL\nORGANIZATIONS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON CRISTIANI?  THE NORTH\nAMERICANS HAD TO RESORT TO SOME FORUM THAT WOULD NOT CONDEMN THE\nGENOCIDAL REGIME AND THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT IN\nSPITE OF ALL THE ATROCITIES THE REGIME HAS COMMITTED.\n\n   THE MOST SUITABLE IDEA WAS TO PROMOTE AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AS WE ALL\nKNOW, THE NORTH AMERICANS HAVE HAD THEIR BACKYARD AND MOST OF THESE\nCOUNTRIES SERVE THEIR INTERESTS.\n\n   THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO TRY TO PULL CRISTIANI OUT OF\nINTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.\n\n   UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DID SUMMIT TAKE PLACE?  WE HAVE TO SAY FIRST\nTHAT THE PRESIDENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA, AND PROBABLY OF\nGUATEMALA, HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MEETING.  THE SUBJECT\nOF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY ARIAS AND CEREZO.

THE FMLN WAS NOT EVEN\nALLOWED TO ENTER COSTA RICA.\n\n   HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AND\nIN SPITE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CRISTIANI WAS\nACHIEVED ALMOST AT THE PRICE OF KILLING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT.  IT\nWAS NOT EASY.  THE U.S. WILL TO CONDEMN THE FMLN AND TO BACK CRISTIANI\nPREVAILED IN THE MIDST OF MUCH BICKERING AND THE INSOLENCE OF THE\nHONDURAN PRESIDENT.\n\n   AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND SUPPORT FOR THE GENOCIDAL\nREGIME EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE NORTH AMERICANS THINK THEY HAVE THE\nBULL BY THE HORNS.\n\n   LET US SEE, AS A THIRD POINT, IN WHAT THE DECLARATION CONSISTS.\n(CONTINUED)", "dateline": "CLANDESTINE, 13 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS)", "char_before": 166705, "char_end": 169770}

THE PURPOSE OF\nTHIS PLAN WAS TO PRESSURE GENERAL NORIEGA TO RESIGN FROM HIS MILITARY\nPOST IN LATE AUGUST.\n\n   THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PLAN WERE: TO INTENSIFY AND\nSPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA WITHIN THE FDP; TO INTENSIFY AND\nSPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA'S COLLABORATORS BY MENTIONING\nSPECIFIC NAMES; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND\nTHAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN\nCOLLABORATORS THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS\nUNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND NORIEGA ALLIES,\nPARTICULARLY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT\nHIS GOVERNMENT WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE\nHOSTILE TO NORIEGA, ESPECIALLY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA, THAT HE HAD\nLOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE\nFOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS THAT DEALT WITH NORIEGA, SUCH AS THE\nFMLN AND THE M-19, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME\nWAS UNSUSTAINABLE; AND TO MOVE THE ANTI-NORIEGA SECTOR WITHIN THE FDP\nTO SUPPORT SPECIFIC ACTIONS AGAINST NORIEGA'S REGIME.\n\n   THE FDP MEMBERS, OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WERE THE TARGETS OF THIS\nPLAN.  WE SEE HOW SOME WERE TAKEN IN BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS\nPLAN.  THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN WERE GEN NORIEGA, NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN\nCOLLABORATORS WITHIN THE FDP, SOME CIVILIANS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT\nARE NORIEGA'S ALLIES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA,\nAND FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEAL WITH NORIEGA. THEY\nIDENTIFIED ALL OF NORIEGA'S VULNERABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE\nVULNERABILITIES OF ALL THE TARGETS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED.\n\n   THERE WERE CERTAIN THEMES USED IN THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS,\nAND THE MEDIA FELL FOR THEM MANY TIMES. THIS IS WHY WE REPEATEDLY\nASKED THEM NOT TO FALL FOR THIS MISINFORMATION.\n\n   THESE THEMES INCLUDED: BY IMPOSING HIS ARBITRARY NATURE AND\nCORRUPTION, NORIEGA IS PERVERTING THE FDP AND PROMOTING THE\nDISINTEGRATION OF THAT MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE FDP HAVE BECOME A\nMAFIA THAT IS HEADING TOWARD DISGRACE. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT HAS BEEN\nDISCUSSED IN LEAFLETS AND MANY PUBLICATIONS.\n\n   BY DISRUPTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AT HIS WHIM, NORIEGA IS\nPROVOKING A PROFOUND SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL CRISIS THAT IS\nRUINING THE COUNTRY. THIS IS DONE TO HIDE THOSE WHO ARE TRULY\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. THE LONGER NORIEGA\nREMAINS IN POWER, THE MORE PROBABLE BECOMES A U.S., CUBAN, OR SOVIET\nINTERVENTION.  THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS PROVOKED BY\nNORIEGA NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF THE FDP MEMBERS\nAND THEIR FAMILIES.\n\n   NORIEGA'S FALL IS INEVITABLE AND THE FDP SHOULD NOT FALL WITH HIM.\nTO SAVE THE FDP AND THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, THE FDP MUST REMOVE\nNORIEGA FROM OFFICE. THIS IS WHY THERE WERE SIREN SONGS THAT AN\nINTERNAL COUP WAS UNDER WAY.\n\n   THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CASE FOR\n5 MONTHS AND WE KNOW THE FUGITIVES ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE KNOW\nWHERE THEY LEFT FROM. NO ONE CAN DENY THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTAIN U.S.\nCITIZENS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION WITH THE PANAMANIAN GROUPS\nTHAT WERE CAPTURED.\n\n   WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE, THE WEAPONS, THE INSTRUMENTS USED FOR\nMISINFORMATION, THE PLANS, AND THE MAPS WITH THE TARGETS FOR VIOLENCE.\nIMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO BE KIDNAPPED HAD ALSO BEEN MARKED\nON THESE MAPS. THEY HAD MARKED THE BRIDGES THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED.\n\n   GENTLEMEN, WE KNOW THE POWER OF WEAPONS AND WE KNOW HOW TO USE\nTHEM.  WE KNOW THE DAMAGE THEY CAN DO. THEREFORE, BEFORE THERE WAS A\nVIOLENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR FDP, WE\nWENT ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEIR PLANS. IF ARRESTS WERE MADE, IT WAS\nBECAUSE WE WANTED TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH INEXPERIENCED GROUPS\nTHAT ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE USED FOR THE PERSONAL BENEFIT OF THOSE\nWHO RECEIVED, WITH A SIREN SONG, THE PROMISE OF THE PANAMANIAN\nPEOPLE'S $30 MILLION THAT ERIC ARTURO DELVALLE WAS GOING TO USE FOR\nSUBVERSIVE ACTS, BLOODY ACTS TO BATHE OUR PEOPLE IN BLOOD, AS IN THE\nCASE OF THE STRUGGLE OF OUR BROTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AND CENTRAL\nAMERICA.\n\n   WE WILL NOT PERMIT THAT.

ODDLY\nENOUGH, HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTY THAT DEVELOPED AFTER THE VICTORY OF\nTHE NO VOTE IS PRESUMABLY HAVING AN EFFECT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE\n\"MINI-ADJUSTMENT.\"  HE REPORTS THAT SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED\nBUSINESSMEN ARE POSTPONING THEIR INVESTMENT PLANS, AND THUS THEIR\nDEMAND FOR CREDIT HAS FALLEN OFF. THE DILEMMA FACING THEM AND OTHER\n\"ECONOMIC AGENTS\" IS WHETHER TO SPEND THE MONEY OR TO DEPOSIT IT.\nTHE CENTRAL BANK COMES INTO PLAY HERE, BECAUSE \"NOT HAVING TO COMPETE\nWITH THE BANKS, IT CAN BEGIN SOAKING UP SOME OF THE MONEY IN\nCIRCULATION WITHOUT BOOSTING INTEREST RATES TOO MUCH. MOREOVER, THEY\nARE ALREADY QUITE HIGH: 5 PERCENT FOR 90-DAY OPERATIONS, AS AGAINST\n4.2 PERCENT DURING THE FIRST HALF.\" IN ADDITION, IT COULD RESORT TO\nITS SIZABLE MONETARY RESERVES AND \"BURN UP\" FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON\nHIGHER IMPORTS TO ABSORB SOME OF THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY.  \"I'M THINKING\nABOUT DEVALUATIONS (OF THE PESO) SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE ONES THIS\nYEAR.\"\n\n   OPTIONS AFTER THE NO VICTORY\n\n   IN ANY EVENT, THE LARGE MASS OF MONEY IN CIRCULATION AND THE\nEXISTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES (WHATEVER THEIR CAUSE) \"CONSTITUTE AN\nEXPLOSIVE SITUATION,\" WHICH ACCORDING TO VILLARZU THE GOVERNMENT WILL\nNOT IGNORE. BECAUSE \"IF IT HAS ANY POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT LEFT, IT\nIS THE VICTORY OVER INFLATION.\" AND THE TIGHTENING UP WILL BE EVEN\nMORE SEVERE IF THE FINANCE MINISTER INSISTS ON ACHIEVING A 5-PERCENT\nRISE IN THE CPI IN 1989, AS THE DRAFT BUDGET SENT TO THE JUNTA CALLS\nFOR. EVEN THE CENTRAL BANK REGARDS THIS GOAL AS DANGEROUS. A\nHIGH-LEVEL CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE SAID THAT \"IT IS VALID TO AIM FOR\nAN INFLATION RATE LIKE THAT IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT WE HAVE TO\nBE CAREFUL BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT (WHICH WOULD TRIGGER A HEAVY\nCONCENTRATION OF SPENDING) REMAINS HIGH.\"\n\n   ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC CARD ARE THE ALREADY\nVISIBLE AND STRONG PRESSURES THAT THE RIGHT HAS BEGUN TO APPLY SO THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE SPENDING IN 1989 OR AT LEAST NOT REDUCE\nIT. THE RIGHT ALSO WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARE MORE\nPOPULIST IN NATURE OR THAT HAVE LESS VISIBLE EFFECTS ON VOTERS.\nSIGNIFICANTLY, EXPERTS ON BUCHI'S OWN TEAM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE\nADMITTING THAT POLITICAL DEMANDS CAN BE GIVEN TO SOME EXTENT WITHOUT\nIGNORING CERTAIN PRINCIPLES.  GAINING GROUND, AS A RESULT, ARE AN\nINCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE (\"TO PAVE THE WAY FOR HIGHER PAY IN\nPRIVATE ENTERPRISE\") AND FURTHER CUTS IN THE VAT (THE RUMOR OF A CUT\nTO 12 PERCENT WAS ALREADY MAKING THE ROUNDS BEFORE THE PLEBISCITE) AND\nIN THE TAX ON CAPITAL.  BUT THE PRIVATIZATION OF ENTERPRISES IS STILL\nSTRONGLY SUPPORTED AS WELL. EVERYTHING POINTS IN THE SAME DIRECTION:\n\"REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT SECTOR AND, AT THE SAME\nTIME, NARROW THE MANEUVERING ROOM ON TAXES FOR A GOVERNMENT DIFFERENT\nFROM THIS ONE.\" IF IT IS SIMILAR, SO MUCH THE BETTER.
