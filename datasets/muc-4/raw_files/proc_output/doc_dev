THE SECOND\nIMPORTANT SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO DENOUNCE THE TIAR, A MILITARY\nORGANIZATION THAT GROUPS ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND THE\nUNITED STATES AND WHICH, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HAS PROVED TO BE\nABSOLUTELY INEFFECTIVE AND PARTIAL.\n\n   THE MALVINAS ISLANDS SITUATION IS A GOOD EXAMPLE.  ACCORDING TO THE\nTIAR, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED ARGENTINA, BUT IT DID\nEXACTLY THE CONTRARY, SUPPORTING THE UNITED KINGDOM.\n\n   NOW, IN THIS CASE WITH PANAMA, THE TIAR HAS NOT SERVED ANY PURPOSE.\nRATHER, IT HAS SERVED TO MASK THE U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.  THEREFORE,\nSINCE WE CONSIDER THE TIAR TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND SENSELESS, WE, AS A\nREPUBLIC, MUST DENOUNCE IT.  WE MUST WITHDRAW OUR SIGNATURE FROM THE\nTIAR.

THEY MUST SUPPORT A RIGHTIST CONCEPT BY WHICH THE UNITED\nSTATES HAS THE HEGEMONIC RIGHT TO SAFEGUARD OUR DESTINY AND TO DECIDE\nWHO CAN GOVERN US AND WHO CANNOT.\n\n   AS PERUVIANS AND LATIN AMERICANS, WE FEEL THAT THE AGGRESSIVE AND\nBLOODY ACTION BY U.S. TROOPS TO OCCUPY A SMALL COUNTRY IS A VIOLATION.\nTHERE ARE CURRENTLY NEARLY 30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS IN PANAMANIAN\nTERRITORY.  THEY HAVE KILLED MANY PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO IMPOSE A NEW\nGOVERNMENT.  THUS, AS LONG AS THOSE TROOPS REMAIN THERE, AS LONG AS\nTHIS VIOLATION TO LATIN AMERICA IS MAINTAINED, OUR AMBASSADOR WILL NOT\nSTAY IN THAT COUNTRY.  THIS DOES NOT IMPLY A BREAK IN RELATIONS; IT\nREPRESENTS A CLEAR GESTURE OF CONDEMNATION AND DISLIKE.\n\n   AS LONG AS A U.S. SOLDIER VIOLATES THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, WE WILL\nKEEP OUR AMBASSADOR HERE.  AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT\nWITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS AND PANAMA REMAINS OCCUPIED, THE PANAMANIAN AND\nPERUVIAN FLAGS WILL REMAIN TOGETHER.\n\n   (REPORTER) DON'T YOU THINK THAT THIS ATTITUDE COULD HARM CERTAIN\nRELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES; THAT IS, COULDN'T IT JEOPARDIZE THE\nIMF LOAN?\n\n   (GARCIA) NOT AT ALL.  THESE ARE TWO ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT THINGS.\nTHE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF ARE ONE THING; THE INTERNATIONAL\nPOLITICAL ATTITUDE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT ABUSES ITS ECONOMIC AND\nMILITARY POWER WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IS SOMETHING ELSE.\n\n   BESIDES, WE SHOULD MENTION SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.  AS FOR\nPANAMANIAN-U.S. RELATIONS, THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THE MAIN\nACCOMPLICES IN DEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY.  WHEN ELECTIONS TOOK\nPLACE IN 1984, WHEN ARNULFO ARIAS SHOULD HAVE WON, THE UNITED STATES\nDECIDED THAT IT WAS NOT CONVENIENT THAT ARIAS SHOULD WIN, SO A LARGE\nFRAUD -- AS IT WAS DECLARED AT THE TIME -- WAS CARRIED OUT TO PLACE\nNICOLAS ARDITO BARLETTA IN POWER.  THE FIRST ONES TO RECOGNIZE ARDITO\nWERE THE AMERICANS.  ARDITO WAS PLACED IN THE PRESIDENCY BY NORIEGA.\n\n   IN 1985 NORIEGA REMOVED ARDITO AND PUT ERIC ARTURO DEL VALLE IN HIS\nPLACE.

WHEN A COUNTRY HAS NO RESERVES OR ONLY $100\nMILLION IN RESERVES, IT CAN APPLY FOR A CREDIT FROM THE IMF TO PAY FOR\nIMPORTS OR OVERDUE DEBTS.  THIS IS THE IMF, AN ORGANIZATION CREATED TO\nFACILITATE THE FLOW OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  AN IMF\nCREDIT IS DEPENDENT ON SIGNING A LETTER OF INTENT OR AN ADJUSTMENT\nPROGRAM.

A REDUCTION\nIN MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR MONTHS\nBECAUSE THE EXPECTED RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN OBTAINED.  I THINK IT IS\nRIDICULOUS AND CHILDISH TO SAY THAT THE AID WILL BE CUT AS THE RESULT\nOF MY REMARKS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL CRIMES WITH WHICH SOME ARMED\nFORCES' MEMBERS HAVE JEOPARDIZED THE INSTITUTION SHOULD BE PUNISHED.\nMY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOLIDARITY SHOULD EXIST IN THE CONTEXT OF\nOPERATIONS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES' CONSTITUTIONAL\nMISSION.  HOWEVER, THOSE WHO HARM THE INSTITUTION SHOULD NOT BE\nPROTECTED.\n\n   I THINK SOME ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION, AS IF\nTO SAY: COL OCHOA HAS ENDANGERED THE ARMED FORCES.

TEN CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF LIMA.  WE MUST\nPARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.\n\n   HOWEVER, THE ELECTORAL ATMOSPHERE THAT PREVAILS SHOULD NOT MAKE US\nFORGET OUR MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR\nFATHERLAND. THIS THREAT IS TERRORISM WHICH COSTS LIVES, INFLICTS\nECONOMIC HARM, FOSTERS INSECURITY, AND CUTS OFF THE POWER THAT WE NEED\nFOR OUR HOMES AND OUR INDUSTRIES.\n\n   WE CONTINUE TO BATTLE TERRORISM. THE ARMED FORCES AND THE NATIONAL\nPOLICE ARE TAKING DRASTIC ACTION IN THE HUALLAGA VALLEY AND IN THE\nMOUNTAIN RANGE.  THEY ARE ALSO BREAKING UP URBAN TERRORIST CELLS.\nHOWEVER, WE MUST ALSO ATTACK TERRORISTS THROUGH LEGAL ACTIONS, THROUGH\nTHE MOST DRASTIC AND SEVERE SENTENCES.\n\n   IRRESPECTIVE OF MILITARY ACTIONS, IF NO SWIFT AND DRASTIC LEGAL\nPUNISHMENT IS METED, THE TERRORISTS KNOW THAT THEY WILL GO UNPUNISHED.\nSTIMULATED BY THIS THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR CRIMES.\n\n   THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS AWARE OF THIS. MOST PERUVIANS WANT SEVERE,\nDRASTIC AND EFFECTIVE PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS. THUS, ON 28 JULY I\nPROPOSED TO THE NATIONAL CONGRESS THAT THE MILITARY COURTS SHOULD TRY\nTERRORISTS. TONIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THIS SUBJECT\nBECAUSE I AM CONCERNED THAT IT MAY REMAIN JUST THAT; A PROPOSAL. I\nWOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK ALL PERUVIANS, ALL ORGANIZATIONS AND\nINSTITUTIONS, TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN\nCONGRESS.\n\n   BY HAVING TERRORISTS TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WE ARE NOT GIVING UP\nANY CIVILIAN PREROGATIVES. WE ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS.\nTHIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE IN OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, THE ARMED FORCES ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF PERU'S\nDEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY FIGHT THE\nBATTLE AGAINST SUBVERSION. NO ONE CAN SAY THAT SETTING UP MILITARY\nCOURTS IS TANTAMOUNT TO MILITARIZING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT WOULD\nIMPLY DISTRUSTING THE ARMED FORCES, OFFENDING THEM AND OVERLOOKING THE\nFACT THAT THEY ARE DEFENDING DEMOCRACY. MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO WE ASKED\nFOR AND WERE ALLOWED TO ESTABLISH SPECIAL COURTS TO TERRORIST CASES.\nSO FAR THESE COURTS HAVE YIELDED NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THUS, AS\nPRESIDENT IT IS MY DUTY TO CALL FOR SEVERE SENTENCES, ISSUED WITHOUT\nDELAY OR ANY THEORETICAL OR ACADEMIC DISCUSSIONS.\n\n   FOLLOWING MY 28 JULY SPEECH I ASCERTAINED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF\nPERUVIANS ARE IN FAVOR OF DRASTIC PUNISHMENTS AND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT\nOF MILITARY COURTS. I HAVE ALSO HEARD SOME LEGAL OBJECTIONS AND\nTHEORETICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS MEASURE.\n\n   THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT THE MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS SAY\nTHAT ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW IT. THIS IS HALF\nTRUE.  ARTICLE 282 STATES: IN CASES OF CRIMES COMMITTED WHILE ON DUTY,\nPOLICE AND ARMED FORCES MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY\nJURISDICTION AND TO THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE WHICH IS NOT\nAPPLICABLE TO CIVILIANS EXCEPT IN THE CASE DESCRIBED BY ARTICLE 235,\nWHICH ESTABLISHES THE APPLICATION OF THE DEATH SENTENCE IN CASE OF\nBETRAYAL OF THE MOTHERLAND DURING WAR.\n\n   NOW, THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS DO NOT\nWANT TO READ THE SECOND PART OF ARTICLE 282 WHICH STATES: THOSE WHO\nAVOID COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY CODE OF\nJUSTICE.  THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE ONE THAT LEGALLY AND CONSTITUTIONALLY\nALLOWS US TO TRY TERRORISTS UNDER THE MILITARY JURISDICTION, BECAUSE\nTERRORISTS ALSO VIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN THEY\nCOMMIT CRIMES.\n\n   MANY PERUVIANS WRONGFULLY THINK THAT THE COMPULSORY MILITARY\nSERVICE ONLY AFFECTS MEN ON ACTIVE SERVICE, LIKE THOSE PERUVIANS WHO,\nAFTER A SELECTION ARE SENT TO SERVE IN A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2\nYEARS. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH ONE COMPLIES WITH THE\nCOMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE.\n\n   THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES IN ARTICLE 2: THE\nCOMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE IN AN UNAVOIDABLE DUTY OF ALL PERUVIANS\nWHO MUST PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL DEFENSE BY COMPLYING WITH THEIR\nMILITARY OBLIGATIONS.

DUARTE\nPROMISED A SOCIAL PACT, A TOLERANT REGIME, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL\nREFORMS, AND, MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, HE PROMISED PEACE.\n\n   ALL OF THESE PROMISES WERE ONLY A MEANS OF ACHIEVING WASHINGTON'S\nGREAT OBJECTIVE: TO CONTROL THE REVOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR OR, IN OTHER\nWORDS, COUNTERINSURGENCY.  FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN.

THE\n19 MARCH ELECTIONS SEALED THE COLLAPSE OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S\nSALVADORAN STRATEGY.

DUARTE DID NOT IN ANY WAY IMPROVE THE MASSES'\nEXTREME POVERTY AND ISOLATION.  SECOND, THE REVOLUTIONARY, POPULAR,\nAND DEMOCRATIC FORCES' QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PROGRESS WAS\nPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS THAT LED TO THE CONFLICT ARE--TODAY MORE\nTHAN EVER--STILL UNRESOLVED.\n\n   THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS RESULTED IN AN ARENA VICTORY, AND ARENA IS\nTHE PARTY THAT REPRESENTS THE MOST ULTRACONSERVATIVE OLIGARCHIC\nSECTORS.

ARENA\nREPRESENTS A RETURN TO THE SYSTEM USED PRIOR TO 15 OCTOBER 1979.  IN\nOTHER WORDS, IT IS A RETURN TO DICTATORIAL CONTROL OF ALL POLITICAL,\nECONOMIC, AND MILITARY POWER.

THIS IS PRECISELY THE CONCEPT OF VICTORY USED IN\nLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE.  ARENA'S VICTORY, AND THE SUBSEQUENT RETURN TO\nTHE OLD SYSTEM, IS OBVIOUSLY CONTRARY TO THE OBJECTIVE OF\nLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE.\n\n   FOR WASHINGTON, OF COURSE, THIS DEFEAT MEANS THAT $3 BILLION WAS\nSQUANDERED.

MANY TIMES YOU HAVE\nHEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A\nWORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO\nHAVE LESS.  INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR\nOWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US.  IF\nLOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE\nGREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT,\nUNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS,\nAND WELL-BEING.\n\n   HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE\nCONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD\nMEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.  A\nFEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL\nPRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL,\nAND ALL FUELS.  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE.\nPERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE\nNOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS.  HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE\nISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL.  WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO\nMONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP.\nTHERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE\nTHAN WHAT IT HAS.  HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE\nPRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES,\nESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE.\n\n   TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE.  IN\nGENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS,\nTHOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE.  IF WE\nSUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A\nGOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS\nAVAILABLE.  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO\nIMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS.  THEREFORE, LET\nUS THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN\nFAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO\nBENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO\nBUY A VEHICLE.\n\n   WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS\nEXAMPLE.  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE,\nWHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS\nCAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE\nLITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING.  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE\nHAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER.\nMOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT\nPOSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES\nTO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE\nCURRENT BUS FARES.  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT.\nTHOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING --\nTHROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN\nNOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO\nPRICE INCREASE.\n\n   THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE\nGAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES\nARE NOT INCREASED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE\nSOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR\nNOTHING AT ALL.\n\n   I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF\nSOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS\nTHE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE\nLOST THEIR SONS.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT\nCHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG.  WE\nMUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT\nFIND A JOB.  THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN\nEFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.\n\n   LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH\nTHE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE\nCHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE.  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS\nTO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE ARE BEGINNING TO\nSENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE.  WE ARE FEELING\nHAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE\nSHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE.\n\n   ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET\nDISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO\nLONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO\nSUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY.

ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY\nGERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE\nOF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS.  PALERMO OWNS FOUR\nTWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN.  HE ALSO\nEXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA.  ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE\nBRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY,\nWHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS.\nPALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING\nTHE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA.\n\n   THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO\nGROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE\nSECTORS.

VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS\nTHAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO\nBENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION.\nTHE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE\nPALERMO'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS' MAIN COCAINE\nSUPPLIER.\n\n   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO\nDO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE (WHICH IS USED BY PALERMO), AND THE\nCORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO\nSUAREZ.  MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM\nSMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE\nSTOLEN IN BRAZIL.  ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS\nMORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED \"MINI-TRAFFIC.\"  THIS\nINVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY\nOF DRUGS EVERY DAY.\n\n   THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS.  MOST OF\nTHEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO.  THEY\nFOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO\nSUAREZ.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS\nCARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA.  GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE\nFOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN\nTRAFFICKERS.  PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA,\nARGENTINA.  HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS\nOF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES\nTHE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN\nBOLIVIA.  BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO\nSANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA.  IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE\nWHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO\nFOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE\nTRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL),\nNEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES\nOF COCAINE.\n\n   NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE.  THE\nDRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND\nACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE\nLARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES.  DOZENS OF\nDRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN\nBY LAW.\n\n   THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ\nREGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR,\nAND LAND.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE\nTRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS,\nAND EVEN IN CHILDREN'S DIAPERS.  THESE TRAFFICKERS GENERALLY TRAVEL BY\nBUS OR BY TRAIN. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE POLICE CAUGHT DOZENS OF\nTRAFFICKERS USING THESE METHODS.

WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF\nEVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL\nSALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE.\nIN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED.\nON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD\nTURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT\nVIOLENCE.  THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS\nMEMBERS.  I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A\nCOMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED\nOF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND.\nTHIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE\nMILITARY PATH.  THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE.  WHAT I WANT\nTO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT\nTHE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK.  WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A\nCOUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING\nTO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL\nDESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE IS SUCH\nTHAT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO CONTINUE.  (CONTINUED)", "dateline": "SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE)", "char_before": 35734, "char_end": 39949}

IF SO WE WOULD HAVE TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH\nAUSTRALIA OR WITH FINLAND.  ONE MUST MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH ALL THE\nPEOPLES OF THE WORLD.  UNDER SUCH CRITERIA, SINCE PERU RECOGNIZES THE\nFRG, IT SHOULD CLOSE ITS EMBASSY IN THE COMMUNIST GDR.  THIS MANICHEAN\nCRITERION, THIS OBTUSE CRITERION, THIS OUTMODED CRITERION IS NO LONGER\nVALID; THE BERLIN WALL HAS BEEN RAZED.  HOW CAN ONE SAY THAT THIS\nCOUNTRY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND ANOTHER SHOULDN'T?  PERU WILL NOT\nACCEPT ANY IMPERIALIST VETO ON ITS WORLD RELATIONS.

HOWEVER, THE FIGHTERS FOR \"FREEDOM,\" \"DEMOCRACY,\"\nAND \"HUMAN RIGHTS\" IN WESTERN NATIONS HAVE KEPT QUIET OUT OF FEAR OF\nTHE NAKED AGGRESSION AND THE WAY OF THE TYRANT.\n\n   ON 20 DECEMBER 1989, SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF U.S.  TROOPS,\nEQUIPPED WITH THE MOST UP-TO-DATE WEAPONS, BRAZENLY INTRUDED INTO\nPANAMA, TOPPLING THE NORIEGA GOVERNMENT AND FORCING MANUEL ANTONIO\nNORIEGA TO BE TRIED IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS U.S. ACT WAS BY NO\nMEANS LESS THAN THE SOVIET ACT OF INVADING CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND\nKIDNAPPING ITS LEADERS AT THAT TIME.  THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT\nESTIMATED THAT THE U.S. INVASION HAD RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF AT\nLEAST 600 PANAMANIAN SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS AND MADE SEVERAL TENS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS.  MORE THAN 5,000 MILITARY AND\nADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT WERE ARRESTED BY\nU.S. TROOPS, AND PANAMA SUFFERED ECONOMIC LOSSES OF $10 BILLION.  THE\nUNITED STATES OPENLY MANIPULATED THE WORK OF ESTABLISHING A NEW\nPANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, NATIONAL DEFENSE ARMY, POLICE FORCE, AND OTHER\nSTATE APPARATUSES, SO MUCH SO THAT IT RUSHED IN AND RAIDED (AS\nPUBLISHED) THE EMBASSIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN PANAMA OR DIPLOMATIC\nAPARTMENTS, AND DETAINED THE DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.\nUNDER THE POWERFUL PRESSURE OF WORLD OPINION, SOME OF THE U.S. TROOPS\nHAVE WITHDRAWN FROM PANAMA, BUT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TO\nPULL OUT ALL ITS TROOPS.\n\n   JUST AFTER ITS INTRUSION INTO PANAMA, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\nIMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED, AS SCHEDULED, THE DISPATCH OF A STRONG FLEET OF\nWARSHIPS INTO THE CARIBBEAN, CLOSE TO THE COAST OF COLOMBIA, FOR WHAT\nWAS CALLED AN ANTIDRUG MANEUVER, INTERCEPTING PLANES AND VESSELS FOR\nTRAFFICKING IN DRUGS.  ON 5 JANUARY THIS YEAR, THE UNITED STATES,\nIGNORING THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, ORDERED A\nFLEET OF FOUR WARSHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER \"KENNEDY\" AND\nNUCLEAR-PROPELLED CRUISER \"VIRGINIA,\" TO SAIL TOWARD THE CARIBBEAN TO\n\"COMBAT DRUG SMUGGLING.\"  SUCH A HIGH-HANDED WAY OF IGNORING THE\nSOVEREIGNTY AND WILL OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS AND FORCING THE\nDEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN FRONT OF THE GATES OF OTHER COUNTRIES EVOKED\nFIERCE REACTIONS IN COLOMBIA AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS.\nJARAMILLO OSSA, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FROM THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOTIC\nUNION, NOTED THAT THE UNITED STATES \"VERY NEARLY\" INVADED COLOMBIA.\nTHE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO WARNED THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT: WITHOUT THE\nAUTHORIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT BARCO, NO U.S WARSHIPS\nARE ALLOWED TO DRAW NEAR (AS PUBLISHED) THE WATERS OF COLOMBIA.  IT\nALSO ORDERED ITS NAVAL AND AIR FORCES TO INTENSIFY THEIR SEA PATROLS\nTO SAFEGUARD THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE\nGOVERNMENTS OF COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA, AND SOME OTHER NATIONS REFUSED TO\nJOIN THE PROPOSED U.S. \"DRUG-FIGHTING DRILL\" IN THE CARIBBEAN.  FACED\nWITH SUCH A SITUATION, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD TO ORDER THE\n\"DRUG-FIGHTING FLEET\" TO RETURN TO BASE AND CANCEL THE \"DRILL.\"\n\n   ON THE AFOREMENTIONED ACTS OF THE UNITED STATES, LEADERS OF SOME\nLATIN AMERICAN NATIONS COMMENTED: WHILE RELAXING THE TENSION WITH THE\nSOVIET UNION, THE UNITED STATES HAS RESERVED THE \"RIGHT\" TO INTERFERE\nBY FORCE IN LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER SMALL AND WEAK COUNTRIES.  THE\nPUBLIC MEDIA OF SOME NATIONS SOLEMNLY POINTED OUT: SUCH MOVES OF U.S.\nAGGRESSION ARE THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONSISTENT U.S. POLICY OF\nINTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF LATIN AMERICA AND ALSO THE EXTENSION OF\nWHAT IS CALLED THE REAGAN DOCTRINE, WHICH STARTED IN THE EARLY 1980'S.\n\n   IN U.S. RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA THROUGHOUT THE DECADE OF THE\n1980'S, THERE WAS A PROBLEM AFFECTING THE SITUATION AS A WHOLE,\nNAMELY, THE ISSUE OF CENTRAL AMERICA, WHICH HAD ALL ALONG BEEN LISTED\nIN THE CATEGORY OF EAST-WEST CONFRONTATION BY THE UNITED STATES.  THE\nREAGAN ADMINISTRATION EVEN GAVE TOP PRIORITY TO MEETING THE CRISIS IN\nCENTRAL AMERICA IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY.\n\n   IN 1981, WHEN REAGAN ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE, THE SITUATION IN\nCENTRAL AMERICA STOOD AS FOLLOWS: THE SANDINISTA REVOLUTION HAD WON\nVICTORY IN NICARAGUA, THE GUERRILLA WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS ESCALATING,\nAND A TURBULENT SITUATION HAD STARTED TO EMERGE IN OTHER CENTRAL\nAMERICAN COUNTRIES.

THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN EAST EUROPE HAS ALSO BEEN\nA SENSATION TO CHILE.  WHAT HOPES DO YOU PLACE IN THESE GIGANTIC\nRADICAL CHANGES?\n\n   AYLWIN: I THINK THAT THE CHANGES IN EAST EUROPE ARE OF VERY GREAT\nIMPORTANCE FOR MANKIND.  THEY GIVE US SATISFACTION AND HOPE.  THE\nOPENING OF THE BERLIN WALL SYMBOLIZES THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA IN\nRELATIONS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST AS WELL AS THE DESIRE OF THE GERMANS\nTO ACHIEVE UNITY AGAIN.

FIRST, A SYMBOLIC EFFECT.  CHILE IS\nTRADITIONALLY A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.  NOW THE LONG PERIOD OF A\nDICTATORIAL REGIME IS ENDING, HOWEVER.  THIS EXPLOSION OF FREEDOM\nCOINCIDES WITH THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CHILE.  THAT IS A\nSTIMULATING FEELING.  WE ARE EMBARKING ON THE ROAD OF HUMANITY.\nSECOND, THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE DANGER OF COMMUNISM IN OUR\nCOUNTRY; PEOPLE SAY THAT COMMUNISM COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR DEMOCRATIC\nFUTURE.  I THINK THAT THE EVENTS IN EAST EUROPE AND THE SOVIET UNION\nDEMONSTRATE THAT COMMUNISM IS NO LONGER A DANGER FOR THE WORLD.  NOR\nFOR CHILE.\n\n   DIE WELT: CHILE HAS THE BEST ORGANIZED COMMUNIST PARTY IN LATIN\nAMERICA.  HAS THIS PARTY CHANGED?  WHAT WAS ITS REACTION?\n\n   AYLWIN: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SITUATION OF SUCH A MONOLITHIC\nAND COHERENT PARTY.  IT WAS ILLEGAL AND WORKED UNDERGROUND FOR A LONG\nTIME.  HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY COMMUNIST PARTY CAN IGNORE\nTHE EVENTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN DOMINATED\nBY COMMUNIST PARTIES.  THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERS HAVE\nADMITTED THAT THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROCESS.\n\n   DIE WELT: WHAT RELATIONSHIP DO YOU HAVE WITH VOLODIA TEITELBOIM,\nTHE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY?  DO YOU SPEAK WITH HIM?\nDO YOU SEE HIM SOMETIMES?\n\n   AYLWIN: WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BOTH\nSENATORS, MEANING PRIOR TO 1973.  WE WERE POLITICAL OPPONENTS, BUT WE\nOFTEN TALKED WITH EACH OTHER.  SINCE THEN, WE HAVE MET ONLY ONCE, AT A\nPOLITICAL FUNCTION.  MY RIVALS IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAVE OFTEN\nMISREPRESENTED OUR RELATIONSHIP, AND HAVE DESCRIBED ME AS TEITELBOIM'S\nSECRET ALLY.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT PERSUASIONS\nCAN TALK WITH EACH OTHER AND CAN REACH AGREEMENT.  THAT HAS BEEN DONE\nIN CHILE WITH SOME SUCCESS.\n\n   DIE WELT: THE COMMUNIST PARTY BACKED YOUR CANDIDACY.

THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR FAMILIES\nIN THE PAST -- THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC FAMILY, THE SOCIAL\nDEMOCRATICALLY-ORIENTED FAMILY OF THE OLD RADICAL PARTY, THE SOCIALIST\nFAMILY, AND THE FAMILY OF THE RIGHT CENTER.  THEY ALL WANT TO SURVIVE.\n\n   DIE WELT: MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SOCIALIST RICARDO LAGOS IS THE\nSTRONGEST FIGURE OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.
