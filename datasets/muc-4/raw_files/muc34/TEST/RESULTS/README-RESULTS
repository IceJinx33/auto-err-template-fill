These directories contain the results of the base tests run for MUC-4
on the TST3 and TST4 data sets.  They also contain sample config and
slotconfig files (external files used by the scoring program) that you
can modify if you wish to score response templates for TST3 or TST4
using the cumulative history file that was produced when NRaD scored
the MUC-4 participants' response templates.

The "response" and "scores" tar files contain subdirectories for each
of the MUC-4 participant organizations.  The identity of the
organizations should be apparent from the directory name, with one
exception:  the directory named "SYNCH" is for the UMBC/ConQuest team
(ConQuest, Inc. was formerly named Synchronetics, Inc.).

Test data other than what is found in these directories may be
obtained by request from Beth Sundheim (sundheim@nosc.mil) at NRaD.
For example, the results for optional test runs that some participants
chose to make are available, as are the results of the MUC3-MUC4
"progress" test.  See the MUC-4 proceedings for information on these
and other components of the MUC-4 evaluation.
