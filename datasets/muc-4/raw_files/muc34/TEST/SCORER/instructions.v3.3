- Instructions file for MUC-4 Scorer
- MUC VERSION 3.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------



To unpack and install the MUC Scoring System:

  1) Make a top-level directory to hold the scoring files. I'll use the 
     meta-variable $SCORE to indicate the name of this directory in the
     rest of these instructions.

         % mkdir $SCORE

  2) If you have obtained the distribution via FTP, skip to step 3.
     If you have received the distribution via e-mail, you need to
     decode the uuencoded binary file.

     Remove the header and everything else up to the "cut here" line in
     the message, and save the remainder in a file in the $SCORE directory
     called "score.TAR.uue".  Go to that directory and uudecode it, producing
     a file called "score.TAR.Z".
   
         % cd $SCORE
         % uudecode score.TAR.uue

     If you get error messages from uudecode about permissions, you may
     need to copy the uue file to /tmp, decode it there, and copy the
     resulting .Z file back to $SCORE.

  3) Most sites receive the full distribution in a file named "score-full.TAR.Z".
     If you have received the smaller version "score.TAR.Z", substitute
     that file for the "score-full" file in the following instructions.
     The file "score-full.TAR.Z" needs to be uncompressed produce 
     "score-full.TAR". 

         % uncompress score-full.TAR.Z

     The directories and files need to be extracted with the tar command.

         % tar xvf score-full.TAR

  4) The file "load.el" contains a variable "*muc-base-directory*" that
     must be changed to point to the $SCORE directory.   Full path names
     must be used.  Since all files are delivered as read-only, change the
     permissions on the file first.

	 % chmod +w lisp/load.el

     Edit "$SCORE/lisp/load.el", and change the variable to point 
     to $SCORE.  This tells the system how to find Lisp files, 
     data files, and the online version of the manual.

     You may want to change the permissions on this file back to -w 
     (read-only) after this is done, for security.

  5) Change directories to the "doc" subdirectory

        % cd doc
     
     and type

        % make all

     to build the hardcopy and online versions of the manual.  The README
     file in that directory describes this process in more detail.


About the files:

  The files in $SCORE and lower-level directories constitute the MUC Message
  Scoring system.  They are used as follows:

   lisp              - Emacs Lisp files, and their byte-compiled versions
   doc               - The hardcopy and online source for the user's manual
   test              - a small test suite to experiment with and test your
                       installation.
   run-scorer.el     - Emacs lisp configuration file for batch mode scoring.
   instructions.v3.0 - this file
  

To load the system and run it on a small set of test cases, do the
following:

  1) Run GNU Emacs, by typing

        % emacs -l $SCORE/lisp/load.el

     from the command line.

  2) Load the test cases by typing

        M-x initialize-muc-scorer $SCORE/test/config.el

     Once you have loaded the test cases, typing 'M-?' in one of the Browser
     display windows will display the online version of the manual, explaining
     how to browse, score, and modify the templates.


To run the Scorer in batch mode:

  1) Edit "$SCORE/run-scorer.el", and change all of the directory path names to
     point to $SCORE/lisp or $SCORE/test. This tells the system where
     to find the load file and configuration file, and where to save the score
     report.  Full path names must be used.

     The file is delivered read-only so the permissions will to be changed with

	 % chmod +w run-scorer.el
 
     and changed back with

	 % chmod -w run-scorer.el
 
  2) Start the scorer with the command:

        % emacs -batch -l $SCORE/run-scorer.el

     This will allow you to run without having to interact with the scoring
     program.  The results will be in the file "test-score".

There are two alternatives to using run-scorer.el, which produces only the
summary totals.  If you want template scores as well, use
run-template-scorer.el, and if you want message level scores use
run-message-scorer.el.
