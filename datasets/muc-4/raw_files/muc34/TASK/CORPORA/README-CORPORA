The tar files in this directory contain the texts (100 texts per file)
and corresponding answer-key templates for the training ("DEV") set
and for each of the four test sets ("TST1", "TST2", "TST3", "TST4").
The file names for the answer keys all start with "key-".  The file
names that start with the name of the data set are for the texts.  In
the case of tst4.tar, there are two files for the texts -- the texts
in tst4-muc4 are all upper case (these are the ones that were used for
testing), and the ones in tst4-muc4.mixed-case are in their original,
mixed upper/lower case.

The other file in this directory (text-headers-info) contains
information on the format of the texts.
