   CLANDESTINE, 20 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE A
REPORT FROM SPAIN.  AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN SUSPENDED.  ATTENTION:
THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPENDED ITS AID TO THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT.

   SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER LUIS YANEZ [AS HEARD] REPORTED TODAY THAT
SPAIN HAS SUSPENDED AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE
KILLINGS OF THE SPANISH JESUITS, WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY
FOR YEARS, ARE RESOLVED.

   THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SERIOUS POLITICAL SETBACK FOR THE ALFREDO
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION FURTHER
ISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE
BECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY
AID.  THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.

   THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  THE INTERNATIONAL
ISOLATION OF THE CRISTIANI REGIME IS GROWING.

   BUENOS AIRES, 13 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] LAST NIGHT, A FEW HOURS
BEFORE THE CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, A VIOLENT EXPLOSION DAMAGED
THE WINDOWS AND FACING OF THE SALVADORAN CONSULATE IN SANTIAGO.  NO
ONE WAS INJURED.

   A FLAG FROM THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR) WAS FOUND
AT THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION.  THE FPMR IS A CLANDESTINE LEFTIST
GROUP THAT PROMOTES "ALL FORMS OF STRUGGLE" AGAINST THE MILITARY
GOVERNMENT HEADED BY GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET.

   POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED SERIOUS
DAMAGE TO THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY BUILDING AND TO NEARBY STRUCTURES IN
THE ELEGANT PROVIDENCIA NEIGHORHOOD IN EASTERN SANTIAGO.

   THE GOVERNMENT CHARGES THAT THE FPMR, WHICH ON 14 DECEMBER WILL
MARK 6 YEARS OF SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY, IS THE "ARMED BRANCH" OF THE
OUTLAWED COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE.  AS OF MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THE
CARABINEROS AND POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICE AGENTS WERE CARRYING OUT
AN INTENSIVE OPERATION TO ARREST THOSE RESPONISBLE FOR THE ATTACK.

   SAN SALVADOR, 18 DEC 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] A TERRORIST
ARRESTED BY THE SALVADORAN NATIONAL POLICE, HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS
RUTH ESPERANZA AGUILAR MARROQUIN, AKA SANDRA.  SHE HAS DESCRIBED U.S.
CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO AS AN ERP [PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY] MEMBER
IN CHARGE OF LOGISTICS.

   AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, CASOLO WAS RELEASED BY A MILITARY JUDGE AFTER
HE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE AGAINST HER.  SOME
GROUPS, HOWEVER, ASSERT THAT CASOLO WAS RELEASED DUE TO POLITICAL
PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THREATENED TO LAUNCH A
WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT EL SALVADOR IF CASOLO WAS NOT
RELEASED.

   AGUILAR MARROQUIN WAS ARRESTED AT 1500 ON 9 DECEMBER AFTER HAVING
PARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON AN URBAN PUBLIC BUS NEAR JUAN PABLO II
BOULEVARD.

   THE WOMAN FLED AND SOUGHT REFUGE INSIDE THE FACILITIES OF THE
SALVADORAN ALBERTO MASFERRER UNIVERSITY, WHERE SHE TOOK A GROUP OF
STUDENTS AS HOSTAGES, THREATENING THEM WITH HAND GRENADES. THE POLICE
PREVENTED HER FROM DOING ANYTHING AND ARRESTED HER, CONFISCATING ONE
.45-CALIBER PISTOL, BULLETS, CARTRIDGES, AND TWO FRAGMENTATION
GRENADES.

   AGUILAR MARROQUIN SAID THAT SHE JOINED THE ERP LAST MARCH AND THAT
SHE WAS PART OF AN URBAN COMMANDO CALLED WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND.
AGUILAR ADDED THAT SHE KNOWS U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO, WHO BELONGS
TO THE ERP, AND THAT CASOLO USED TO MEET WITH TERRORIST LEADER
FERNANDO, WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND OPERATIONS CHIEF, NEAR THE NATIONAL
UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY (UES).

   AGUILAR ADDED THAT CASOLO WAS IN CHARGE OF ERP LOGISTICS,
ESPECIALLY LODGING PEOPLE AND TRANSPORTING ARMS AND WAR EQUIPMENT.
THE ERP HAD GIVEN HER TWO MINIBUSES FOR HER TO CARRY OUT HER TASKS.

   IN ADDITION, AGUILAR SAID THAT SHE BELIEVES CASOLO HAD A LEADING
POSITION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH
FERNANDO, SHE ALSO MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS MINCHO, WHO IS THE
POLITICAL-MILITARY ERP METROPOLITAN CHIEF AND ALSO THE CHIEF OF THE
SO-CALLED URBAN COMMANDOS.

   THE PRISONER KNEW ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ARMS IN CASOLO'S
HOUSE, BECAUSE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AGUILAR'S CHIEF, KNOWN AS MIRIAM,
TOLD HER ABOUT IT. OTHER TERRORISTS WENT TO CASOLO'S HOUSE TO GET
WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND EXPLOSIVES TO CONDUCT THEIR SABOTAGE
OPERATIONS AGAINST BUSES, TELEPHONE DISTRIBUTION BOXES, POWER PYLONS,
OR TO CONDUCT LARGE OPERATIONS--AS AGUILAR DESCRIBED THEM-- SUCH AS
ATTACKS ON MILITARY GARRISONS.

   ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION OBTAINED, THE PRISONER WILL BE SENT TO
COURT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

   LA PAZ, 20 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] A POWERFUL DYNAMITE CHARGE TODAY
EXPLODED NEAR THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN LA PAZ.  THE POLICE REPORTED
THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO ALL BUILDINGS ON THE
BLOCK.

   THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT 2130 (0130 GMT) ON THURSDAY [AS
RECEIVED].  IT DAMAGED WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK.

   JOSE PARADA GRANDY, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE CHIEF, TOLD EFE THAT AN
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON STEPPED OUT OF A VEHICLE AND PLACED A PACKAGE IN
ONE OF THE PLANT POTS ON JUAN DE LA RIVA STREET, A FEW METERS FROM THE
U.S. EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN LA PAZ.

   PARADA SAID: "THE VEHICLE LEFT AND IMMEDIATELY THE CHARGE WENT OFF
CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE."

   THE "ZARATE WILLKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION," A GROUP WITH AN
INDIAN BAKCGROUND, HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK IN A
COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS SENT TO SOME MEDIA.

   THE NOTE, SIGNED WITH THE INITIALS OF THE "ZARATE WILLKA" GROUP,
STATES: "IN DEFENSE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE.
DEATH TO THE INVADER. OUR HATRED IS RELENTLESS; OUR WAR IS TO DEATH."

   THE "ZARATE WILLKA" GROUP CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY IN AUGUST 1988 FOR
THE ATTACK AGAINST THEN U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ AND THE
KILLING OF TWO MORMON MISSIONARIES.

   TODAY'S BOMB EXPLOSION DAMAGED THE SHELVES OF A BOOK STORE, THE
"PEOPLE'S PERUVIAN BANK," THE STATE BANK [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED]; THE
MARISCAL BALLIVIAN BUILDING, AND OTHER SHOPS, ALL OF WHICH ARE LOCATED
NEAR THE U.S.  EMBASSY.

   AFTER THE EXPLOSION, A GROUP OF U.S. AGENTS CALLED OFF AN
INVESTIGATION AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SHOUTED
AT THEM, "YANKEES, OUT OF PANAMA."

   THE U.S. EMBASSY PRESS ATTACHE, BRUCE WARTON, SAID TODAY THAT "IT
IS OBVIOUSLY A DESPICABLE ACTION THAT DOES MORE HARM TO BOLIVIANS THAN
TO THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE WE HAVE SUFFERED NO DAMAGES."

   SANTIAGO, 20 MAR 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [CHILEAN
PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I AM ADDRESSING
YOU AFTER OUR COUNTRY HAS BEGUN TO OVERCOME, WITH EFFORT AND TENACITY,
THE FIRST OBSTACLES OF A SERIOUS CRISIS, THE FUTURE IMPLICATIONS AND
REPERCUSSIONS OF WHICH WE STILL DO NOT KNOW. I THEREFORE WANTED TO
CONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHOW
THEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION.

   FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMIC
AGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TO
TACKLE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO
MEET WITH U.S.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AFTER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS,
THESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAPE
PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AFFECTING OTHER FRUITS REMAINS TO BE SOLVED.

   THIS NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CHILEAN NATION, AN ATTACK THAT DESTINY
HAS PLACED IN THE NATION'S PATH OF FREEDOM, PROGRESS, AND WELL-BEING,
COMPELS US TO CLOSE RANKS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT, UNIFIED AND READY TO
FIGHT -- WITH COURAGE AND HIGH SPIRIT -- THE PROBLEM THAT FACES US.

   ON THIS OCCASION THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN HOW THE COUNTLESS THREATS TO
BOYCOTT THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAVE WORKED. MOST OF THE TIME SUCH
THREATS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, OR
COMMUNIST LABOR UNIONS, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO
-- DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -- HAVE CONTINUALLY
JEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHOM
THEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THEY DO NOT CARE IF
THEY CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HUNGER TO 500,000 FELLOW
CITIZENS WHO WORK IN THIS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY.

   HOW SHAMELESSLY THEY MAKE CLAIMS AND DEMANDS, OFFERING THEIR
SUPPORT AND THEIR SOLIDARITY WHEN CHILE IS SERIOUSLY THREATENED! YET
WHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVEL
CHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS. IN DOING
THAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEAN
NATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE
THE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL.

   GENTLEMEN: OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE OF
ADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION OF
TREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES,
FATHERLAND, OR LAW.

   CHILEANS: A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN THE
INSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS
MADE IN ALL FIELDS.

   THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPES
HAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE
SHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOW
COUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO A
LIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT
SOME OFFICIALS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES, WITHOUT WEIGHING THE TRUE
EFFECTS OF THIS TYPE OF MEASURE, HAVE RESTRICTED THE IMPORT OF CHILEAN
FRUITS, THUS PROVOKING FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER
MARKET. GENTLEMEN, WE MUST REVERSE THIS SITUATION.

   WE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN ACT IN A UNITED MANNER TO RECOVER
INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND OUR UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP AS EXPORTERS.
I AM SURE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED WITH A NEW JOINT EFFORT. [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 22 APR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] DEAR RADIO AUDIENCE: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT ABOUT A VERY
IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.  MANY TIMES YOU HAVE
HEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A
WORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO
HAVE LESS.  INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR
OWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US.  IF
LOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE
GREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT,
UNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS,
AND WELL-BEING.

   HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE
CONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD
MEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.  A
FEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL
PRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL,
AND ALL FUELS.  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE.
PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE
NOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS.  HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE
ISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL.  WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO
MONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP.
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE
THAN WHAT IT HAS.  HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE
PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES,
ESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE.

   TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE.  IN
GENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS,
THOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE.  IF WE
SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A
GOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS
AVAILABLE.  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO
IMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS.  THEREFORE, LET
US THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN
FAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO
BENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO
BUY A VEHICLE.

   WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS
EXAMPLE.  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE,
WHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS
CAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE
LITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING.  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE
HAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER.
MOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT
POSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES
TO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE
CURRENT BUS FARES.  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT.
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING --
THROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN
NOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO
PRICE INCREASE.

   THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE
GAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES
ARE NOT INCREASED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE
SOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR
NOTHING AT ALL.

   I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF
SOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS
THE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE
LOST THEIR SONS.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT
CHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG.  WE
MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT
FIND A JOB.  THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN
EFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.

   LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH
THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE
CHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE.  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS
TO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE ARE BEGINNING TO
SENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE.  WE ARE FEELING
HAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE
SHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE.

   ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET
DISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO
LONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO
SUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY.  THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TO
SEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES AND
ACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE.

   THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OUR
COUNTRY'S RECONSTRUCTION.  IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THE
PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE WANT ALL
SALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THAT
THOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER.

   THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OF
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OUR
SOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS
KNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CAN
COME OUT AHEAD.  THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND
MAY GOD BLESS YOU.

   MEDELLIN, 12 APR 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN
GOMEZ MARTINEZ ONCE MORE INSISTED TODAY ON "AN IMMEDIATE DIALOGUE"
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COCAINE TRAFFICKERS "TO END THE WAR IN
WHICH INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED."

   THE MAYOR REITERATED HIS POSITION WHEN HE COMMENTED ON THE ATTACK
IN WHICH 20 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND APPROXIMATELY 100 WERE INJURED,
WHICH WAS PERPETRATED YESTERDAY BY TERRORISTS ON THE DRUG CARTEL'S
PAYROLL NEAR ITAGUI MUNICIPALITY.

   THE BLAST FROM THE EXPLOSION HIT A TRUCK FULL OF POLICEMEN, WHO HAD
EARLIER CARRIED OUT AN ANTI-MAFIA OPERATION IN A PEASANT VILLAGE, AS
WELL AS SEVERAL PUBLIC BUSES, HOUSES, AND BUSINESSES.

   A POLICE EXPERT SAID THAT THE CAR BOMB (CONTAINING 300 KG OF
DYNAMITE) WAS ACTIVATED BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE ELITE FORCE PATROL
PASSED BY.

   ACCORDING TO GOMEZ MARTINEZ, "THESE ACTIONS WILL ONLY CEASE WHEN
(PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS') GOVERNMENT PUTS ASIDE SO MUCH
PREJUDICE AND AGREES TO THE PEACE TALKS," PROPOSED BY THE SUBVERSIVES.

   "THE DIALOGUE WILL TAKE PLACE SONNER OR LATER, AND IT IS BETTER TO
START NOW," INSISTED THE MAYOR OF MEDELLIN, A CITY WHERE THE WORLD'S
MOST POWERFUL CARTEL HAS ITS BASE OF OPERATIONS.

   THE CHIEF OF THE CRIMINAL GANG, PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, ORDERED THE
ASSASSINATION OF MEDELLIN POLICEMEN IN RETALIATION FOR THE
GOVERNMENT'S ACTION AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  TWENTY-EIGHT
POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS CITY OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

   ACCORDING TO SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS, YESTERDAY'S ATTACK "COULD BE
ESCOBAR GAVIRIA'S RESPONSE TO THE ARREST OF ADOLFO MESA MENESES," HIS
RIGHT-HAND MAN.

   MESA MENESES WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEK BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS, SECRET POLICE), AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE
ACCUSED HIM OF ASSASSINATING -- ON ORDERS FROM THE MAFIA LEADER --
LEFTIST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, AS WELL AS A
CHIEF OF POLICE, A MAYOR, AND SEVERAL JOURNALISTS.

   MEANWHILE, HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND DETECTIVES ARE
CARRYING OUT LARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN THE COLOMBIAN COUNTRYSIDE AND
BORDER AREAS ON THE SUSPICION THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA PLANS TO FLEE THE
COUNTRY.

   LAST NIGHT, A TELEVISION NEWSCAST SHOWED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE "DRUG
LORD" THAT HAD BEEN "RECENTLY" TAKEN BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS AT A
COLOMBIAN BEACH ON THE PACIFIC COAST.

   A POLICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED TODAY THAT "WE HAVE
RELIABLE INFORMATION ON HIS WHEREABOUTS," ALTHOUGH HE REFRAINED FROM
GIVING FURTHER DETAILS.  UNOFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
"IS SOMEWHERE IN WESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT" -- OF WHICH MEDELLIN IS
THE CAPITAL -- WHERE THE SEARCH OPERATIONS ARE CONCENTRATED.

   COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO ASKED FOR THE COOPERATION OF
BRAZIL, ECUADOR, PANAMA, PERU, AND VENEZUELA TO STOP THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS FROM ESCAPING TO THOSE COUNTRIES.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE STARTED
A NEW DAY, THE SEVENTH, AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] IS STILL HOLDING ITS POSITIONS.  WE HAVE NOT RETREATED A
SINGLE STEP. IF WE MAKE ANY MOVE, IT WILL BE TO ADVANCE TOWARD THE
ENEMY BARRACKS, BECAUSE WE WILL SEIZE POWER AND EXPEL THE MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP THAT HAS INSTALLED ITSELF IN OUR HOMELAND.  THE FMLN
MAINTAINS FOR THE 7TH DAY ITS POSITIONS IN THE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS.
WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IN SAN MIGUEL; WE HAVE MADE AN IMPORTANT
SEIZURE OF WEAPONS IN SAN MIGUEL.

   THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE BETTER IN SAN SALVADOR.  LAST NIGHT WE
REPORTED THAT THE ARCH OF LIBERTY EXISTS IN THE CAPITAL; IT IS
COMPRISED OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOUSING PROJECTS -- WHERE THE
PROTAGONISTS OF THIS HISTORY ARE THE MASSES, WHICH ARE ORGANIZED FOR
THE CONSTRUCTION OF TRENCHES AND BARRICADES.  THE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST
IMPORTANT PROTAGONISTS IN THIS HISTORIC ACTION.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS URGES THE PEOPLE TO MULTIPLY THEIR ORGANIZATION IN
EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN.  POPULAR COMMITTEES
MUST BE ORGANIZED; THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVES; BUT IF THE
ENEMY IS NEAR, THIS MUST BE DONE CLANDESTINELY.  ALL THE GROUPS IN
EACH TOWN, MEANING THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS,
TEACHERS ORGANIZATIONS, AND COOPERATIVES, MUST ALL ORGANIZE,
REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS.  OUR UNITY MUST BECOME THE BEST
TOOL TO EVICT, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE MURDEROUS MILITARY DICTATORSHIP
WHICH ASSASSINATES PRIESTS AND WHICH BOMBED THE CAPITAL AGAIN EARLY
THIS MORNING.  IT HAS AGAIN CAUSED MORE DEATHS AND WOUNDED IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE COMMITTEES IN EACH
NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN, AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY MUST
PARTICIPATE. IF THE ARMED FORCES ARE NEAR, THEN CLANDESTINE
ORGANIZATION MUST BE CONDUCTED IN SMALL TOWNS, VILLAGES, AND
NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVE TO CONSPIRE AGAINST
DEATH, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE ASSASSINS, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST POVERTY,
TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HUNGER, AND TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE BOMBINGS.  IT
IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE; IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY.  EL SALVADOR MUST BECOME A BODY COMPRISED OF ORGANIZED
CELLS -- EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM -- REGARDLESS OF THE
PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR POLITICAL PARTY.

   WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE DECEIVED ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE] RANK AND FILE, WHO VOTED BELIEVING THAT THIS GOVERNMENT
WOULD REPRESENT A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.  WE ALSO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO
ALL THE PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF THE HOMELAND, URGING THEM TO STOP THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE CAPITAL, TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY.
WE URGE THEM TO UNITE AND STOP THE WAR; AND THE END OF THE WAR IS NEAR
-- WITH THE PEOPLE'S VICTORY.  [CONTINUED]

   RIO DE JANEIRO (BRAZIL), NO DATE (O GLOBO) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
LAWYER CARLOS OLDINEY REPORTED THE GANG AND FEDERAL AGENTS VALDEMIR
LOPEZ PRAZERES AND LUIS JOSE DA CONCEICAO AND DETECTIVES PAULO
MASSANHYO AND CARLOS ANGEL SERRANO CASTILESSO WERE ARRESTED.

   CAMBARALAMAIA'S ORGANIZATION IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY GANGS IN THE
REGION THAT DEALS WITH BOLIVIAN COCAINE.  ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY
GERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE
OF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS.  PALERMO OWNS FOUR
TWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN.  HE ALSO
EXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA.  ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE
BRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY,
WHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS.
PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING
THE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA.

   THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO
GROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE
SECTORS.  PALERMO EXCHANGES THE CHEMICALS FOR TONS OF COCAINE PASTE
WHICH, IN THE OPINION OF REGIONAL FEDERAL POLICE DELEGATE FRANCISCO
VIANA QUEIROZ, IS ALSO PROCESSED IN PARAGUAY.  VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS
THAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO
BENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION.
THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE
PALERMO'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS' MAIN COCAINE
SUPPLIER.

   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO
DO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE (WHICH IS USED BY PALERMO), AND THE
CORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO
SUAREZ.  MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM
SMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE
STOLEN IN BRAZIL.  ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS
MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED "MINI-TRAFFIC."  THIS
INVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY
OF DRUGS EVERY DAY.

   THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS.  MOST OF
THEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO.  THEY
FOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO
SUAREZ.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS
CARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA.  GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN
TRAFFICKERS.  PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA,
ARGENTINA.  HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS
OF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES
THE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN
BOLIVIA.  BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO
SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA.  IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE
WHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO
FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE
TRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL),
NEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES
OF COCAINE.

   NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE.  THE
DRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND
ACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE
LARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES.  DOZENS OF
DRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN
BY LAW.

   THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ
REGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR,
AND LAND.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE
TRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS,
AND EVEN IN CHILDREN'S DIAPERS.  THESE TRAFFICKERS GENERALLY TRAVEL BY
BUS OR BY TRAIN. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE POLICE CAUGHT DOZENS OF
TRAFFICKERS USING THESE METHODS.  NOW, HOWEVER, ONLY WITH THE
COMPLICITY OF THE POLICE CAN CARS CARRYING BOLIVIAN COCAINE PRODUCED
IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION REACH CAMPO GRANDE.

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA
BY AMAT AND AN UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [AMAT] MR.
PRESIDENT, WHEN ONE SEES PERU FACING THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS
EXPERIENCING NOW, THE SAME AS OUR OWN COUNTRY AND LATIN AMERICA IN
GENERAL, ONE ASKS HIMSELF: WOULD A MAN, A NOVELIST LIKE MARIO VARGAS
LLOSA, BE THE RIGHT MAN TO LEAD PERU?

   [GARCIA] AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TO
EVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHER
ETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO IS
CONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOU STEP DOWN FROM THE
PRESIDENCY?

   [GARCIA] WELL, I AM GOING TO BE FREE.

   [AMAT] WHY DO YOU NOT COME TO COLOMBIA AND I AM SURE...

   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPE
SOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT.  HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY
HONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, AND
DOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONE
OUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH IS
ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.
FOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THE
PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OF
TRUTHS.  ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF IT
FAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOU
THE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS.  THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT AND
ADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TO
EDUCATING.  THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO.

   [AMAT] NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALL
PERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA?  WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTS
HIM.

   [GARCIA] BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE
ME AS PRESIDENT.  [LAUGHTER]

   [AMAT] EVEN HIM, FOR INSTANCE?

   [GARCIA] I DID NOT SAY SO.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I NEVER FALL TO THE
LEVEL OF DEFINING PEOPLE OR POINTING OUT LAST NAMES.  I MAKE AN
OUTLINE OR DEFINE THEM IN THE NEGATIVE.

   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THIS DIALOGUE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS.  ADDRESSING OUR PEOPLE
AND OUR COUNTRY, [WORDS INDISTINCT], HOW WERE THINGS TODAY AT THE
SUMMIT?

   [GARCIA] VERY WELL.  COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTION
THREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED,
MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED
STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THIS IS NOT
ONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA.  IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILL
TACKLE IT.  THE DAY A NEWSPAPER WAS BLOWN UP IN BOGOTA I CAME TO
BOGOTA BECAUSE I FELT THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THREATENED ON THE
CONTINENT.  AFTER ALL, WE ARE LATIN AMERICANS.  LET COLOMBIANS HAVE
CONFIDENCE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [ALFREDO
VILLAREAL] [TEXT] THE CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
[COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE] HAS CATEGORICALLY DENIED THAT THERE ARE
ANY RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN ARMY OFFICERS AND U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS,
AS ASSERTED BY THE WASHINGTON POST.  THE NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THE
ALLEGED RIFT BETWEEN THE MILITARY OFFICERS BEGAN ONCE IT WAS
DISCOVERED WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IN
WHICH ONE COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND SIX SOLDIERS ARE BEING
CHARGED.

   COLONEL PONCE SAID THAT THE RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISERS -- ABOUT
52 IN THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CORDIAL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS
ARE NORMAL AS USUAL.  THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN
THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE WORKING
WITH US.

   [REPORTER] WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE WIRE REPORTS STATING THERE ARE
RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS AND U.S.  ADVISERS HAVE
ORGINIATED?

   [PONCE] I DO NOT KNOW; I CANNOT UNDERSTAND.  THERE ARE ALWAYS
THOSE WHO TRY TO BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES.  THIS IS A POOR
COUNTRY THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON U.S. ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID.

   [REPORTER] FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, WHAT ARE RELATIONS
LIKE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND THE GRINGO ADVISERS?

   [PONCE] AS USUAL, THESE RELATIONS ARE VERY CORDIAL, AND THEY
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US.  AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO ADVISERS ARE HERE WITH
ME NOW AT THE TABLE PRESIDING OVER THE EVENT.  THE SAME HAS BEEN THE
CASE WITH ALL THE UNITS IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.  I FAIL TO SEE ANY
DIFFERENCE IN RELATIONS BEFORE AND AFTERWARD. [END RECORDING]

   THE MILITARY CHIEF REPEATED THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE STATE OF
EMERGENCY, NOT ONLY DUE TO THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO KEEP
CONTROL OVER THE ORGANIZATION FRONTS JUST PRIOR TO AN EXPECTED WAVE OF
PROTESTS ON THE LATEST GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE MUST START THINKING WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO
DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE FACE OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN
ISSUED OR ARE PLANNED.  WE MUST THINK WHAT THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE
OR THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ORGANIZATION
FRONTS WILL BE, AS THEY ALWAYS USE ANY EXCUSE TO DISRUPT DOMESTIC
ORDER.  IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN
DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY. [END RECORDING]

   THE HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICER GAVE THESE STATEMENTS AT THE
CEREMONY TO TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY.  THE NEW COMMANDER IS COLONEL RICARDO ALFONSO
CASANOVA SANDOVAL, WHO REPLACES COLONEL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES
MORENO, REMOVED FROM HIS POST AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF ORDERING THE
MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

   MEANWHILE, COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN APPOINTED
COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE BASED IN USULUTAN, AND IN LA
UNION DEPARTMENT THE CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONIES OF THE ARMED FORCES
MILITARY TRAINING CENTER HAVE TAKEN PLACE, WHERE COLONEL FRANCISCO
ARTURO LOPEZ WILL BE IN COMMAND REPLACING COLONEL CARLOS ALFREDO
RIVAS, WHO HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.

   QUITO, 30 APR 90 (RADIO QUITO) -- [STATEMENT] [COMMUNICATIONS
SECRETARY PEDRO SAAD] [TEXT] THIS AFTERNOON, ON THE BERMEJA RIVER,
SUCUMBIOS PROVINCE, IN NORTHEASTERN ECUADOR, AT APPROXIMATELY ONE AND
A HALF KM FROM THE COLOMBIAN BORDER, A SMALL ECUADORAN FLAGSHIP
WORKING WITH THE IMANCO MINING COMPANY, WAS INTERCEPTED BY A COLOMBIAN
VESSEL WHICH FIRED AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

   THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE WERE ABOARD THE ECUADORAN FLAGSHIP: U.S.
CITIZEN SCOTT HEYNDAL, ECUADOREANS LUIS ANTONIO MENESES BENAVIDES AND
EDWIN RODRIGO TENEDA PARRENO, AND COLOMBIAN PILOT JULIO TORRES.  MR.
TORRES WAS KILLED AND MR. MENESES WAS WOUNDED.

   THE ATTACKERS, WHO WORE FIELD UNIFORMS OF THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY,
BOARDED THE ECUADORAN VESSEL, AND, AFTER NOTICING THAT MR. MENESES WAS
WOUNDED, GAVE HIM 100,000 COLOMBIAN PESOS AND THEN LEFT HIM AND MR.
TORRES' BODY.  THE ATTACKERS RETURNED TO COLOMBIA TAKING HEYNDAL AND
TENEDA WITH THEM.  THEY CROSSED THE BORDER AND SAILED UPRIVER FOR
ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS ON THE RUMIYACU RIVER.

   THE ATTACKERS SPENT THE EVENING AT A CAMP NEAR THE RIVER AND FORCED
MR. HEYNDAL TO WRITE LETTERS TO HIS BOSS AT THE MINING PROJECT, MR.
JEFF SINO, ALSO A U.S. CITIZEN, AND TO HIS WIFE.  THOSE LETTERS WERE
GIVEN TO MR. TENEDA, WHO RECEIVED 20,000 COLOMBIAN PESOS. HE WAS THEN
ORDERED TO RETURN TO ECUADOR AND GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR DELIVERING THE
LETTERS.

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] FIGHTING RAGED
ALL DAY LONG IN THE AREA AROUND SAN TERESA HOSPITAL, IN ZACATELUCA, LA
PAZ DEPARTMENT. A REPORT SAYS THAT A DMIFA ARMED FORCES ENGINEERS'
MILITARY DETACHMENT UNIT WAS AT SANTA TERESA HOSPITAL, AND THAT THE
ENTIRE UNIT WAS WIPED OUT.  THE SOLDIERS HAD A COMMUNICATIONS RELAY
STATION IN THE BUILDING. AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK, THERE WERE 20
CASUALTIES. AMONG THE CASUALTIES IS A LIEUTENANT WHO WAS THE UNIT
CHIEF, AND TWO SERGEANTS. THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT WAS TOTALLY
DESTROYED.

   THE SITUATION IS NOT AS THE FASCIST CRISTIANI REPORTED IT TO BE.  HE
SAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE SOLDIER AT THE HOSPITAL RECEIVING MEDICAL
TREATMENT. THAT IS TOTALLY FALSE. THE BUILDING HOUSED A GARRISON NOT A
HOSPITAL, BECAUSE A DMIFA UNIT AND A COMMUNICATIONS RELAY CENTER WERE
THERE. IT WAS A GARRISON.

   WE ARE GOING TO CORRECT OUR REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE ATTACK ON
THE DMIFA UNIT: 20 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 10 WERE WOUNDED.  IN ALL,
THERE WERE 30 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING TWO SERGEANTS AND THE UNIT CHIEF.
WE REPEAT: IN AN IMPRESSIVE ATTACK ON A MILITARY POSITION AT SANTA
TERESA HOSPITAL--THE BUILDING WAS NO LONGER A HOSPITAL BUT AN ARMY
COMMUNICATIONS CENTER--OUR FIGTHTERS ANNIHILATED AND DESTROYED THAT
POSITION. THE ARMY SUSTAINED 20 KILLED AND 10 WOUNDED. THE
COMMUNICATIONS RELAY STATION WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED.

   MEDELLIN, 27 AUG 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] TODAY, MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA'S
SECOND LARGEST CITY, ONCE AGAIN EXPERIENCED A TERRORIST ESCALATION
WHEN SEVEN BANK BRANCH OFFICES WERE SHAKEN BY EXPLOSIVES THAT CAUSED
HEAVY DAMAGE BUT NO FATALITIES, ACCORDING TO RADIO REPORTS BROADCAST
IN BOGOTA (500 KM TO THE SOUTH).

   THE TARGETS OF THE ATTACKS WERE THE BANCO CAFETERO BRANCHES AND ITS
OFFICES IN MEDELLIN'S MIDDLE, WESTERN, AND SOUTHEASTERN AREAS.

   ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, OVER 55 KG OF DYNAMITE WERE USED
IN THE ATTACKS.  THE RADIO REPORT ADDED THAT THE POLICE DEFUSED
ANOTHER 20 KG OF EXPLOSIVES THAT HAD SLOW BURNING FUSES.

   THE MEDELLIN CARTEL OPERATES IN THIS CITY LOCATED IN COLOMBIA'S
NORTHEASTERN AREA.  FOR SEVERAL DAYS NOW, THE CITY HAS BEEN SHAKEN BY
ARMY AND POLICE OPERATIONS IN AN UNPRECEDENTED ACTION TO CAPTURE DRUG
LORDS.

   NO ONE HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, WHICH
LASTED FOR 1 HOUR.

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] ALTHOUGH IT ORGANICALLY DEPENDS ON THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THE COMMISSION IS AN OFFICIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION
AND THE JUDGE CAN INSTRUCT IT OR REQUEST THAT IT INVESTIGATE X, Y, OR
Z, IN ADDITION TO WHAT IT SUBMITTED WHEN THE CASE WAS PASSED OVER TO
THE JUDGE.

   [MODERATOR] PABLO GUILLERMO [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, THE NEWSPAPER LA JORNADA OF MEXICO STATED
YESTERDAY THAT COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY THIS
WEEKEND WITH ALL HIS FAMILY AND WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE,
WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT HE DID NOT GO ON A MERE VACATION.  I WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW THE OFFICIAL VERSION OF THIS. [LAUGHTER]

   [CRISTIANI] YOU SAY HE LEFT WHEN?

   [REPORTER] YESTERDAY.

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, ONLY IF HE LEFT VERY HURRIEDLY AFTER MIDDAY.  I
WAS WITH HIM HERE YESTERDAY DISCUSSING OTHER THINGS, AS WELL AS
MILITARY MATTERS WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND DEPUTY MINISTERS.  HE
WAS PRESENT.  UNLESS HE MAY HAVE LEFT.  I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH, BECAUSE
I HAD A MEETING WITH THEM TO SEE THE ORDER OF THE MONTH ON SATURDAY
AND HE WAS PRESENT.  PARDON ME, THAT WAS TUESDAY WHEN WE HAD THE ORDER
FOR THE END OF THE MONTH.  I UNDERSTAND HE WAS PRESENT AT THE
COMMANDERS MEETING.  IF HE LEFT LAST WEEKEND, IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR
THE WEEKEND AND HE RETURNED ON MONDAY.

   [MODERATOR] MARIA CORTINA, NOTIMEX.

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, IN WHAT WAY WOULD A CUT IN MILITARY AID
AFFECT THE PEACE PROCESS?

   [CRISTIANI] WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING OPPOSITE SIGNS FROM THE FMLN IN
TERMS OF WANTING TO TRULY PUT AN END TO VIOLENCE.  A SIGN OF THIS WAS
THE NIGHT OF 1 MAY WHEN THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT.  THIS WOULD
INDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THE FMLN COMMAND, THAT IS THE FIVE
GROUPS, SOME GROUPS SEEM TO RESIST A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND FAVOR A
MILITARY SOLUTION, AS THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING FOR 10 YEARS.
THOSE GROUPS COULD VIEW A CUT IN MILITARY AID AS A SIGN OF WEAKENING
OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THEY
WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL FOLLOWING THE MILITARY
PATH.  THAT COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL OF A MILITARY SOLUTION IN THE
MINDS OF SOME.  THIS COULD REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.

   [MODERATOR] RAUL MONGE, CADENA RADIO CENTRO.

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, HOW DO YOU VIEW THE GUERRILLAS' MORALE AT
THIS MOMENT?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I OBVIOUSLY CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THE MORALE OF
THE GUERRILLAS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE MUST HAVE DROPPED CONSIDERBLY.
THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO SINCE THERE WAS A LARGE SACRIFICE ON THEIR PART
IN THE FORM OF CASUALTIES AND THE FACT THAT THE OFFENSIVE DID NOT
REPRESENT A SUCCESS, DESPITE THEIR CLAIM THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHOW OF
FORCE, WHICH IS A LOT OF MALARKEY.  ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATED
THAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROW
THE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY.  WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF
EVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL
SALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE.
IN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED.
ON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD
TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT
VIOLENCE.  THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS
MEMBERS.  I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A
COMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED
OF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND.
THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE
MILITARY PATH.  THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE.  WHAT I WANT
TO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT
THE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK.  WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A
COUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING
TO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL
DESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE IS SUCH
THAT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO CONTINUE.  [CONTINUED]

   TOKYO (JAPAN), 8 DEC 89 (KYODO) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT
VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS CUT SHORT HIS STAY IN JAPAN AND LEFT FOR HOME
FRIDAY MORNING FOLLOWING A TRUCK-BOMB EXPLOSION IN THE COLOMBIAN
CAPITAL OF BOGOTA ON WEDNESDAY.

   BARCO, THE FIRST HEAD OF STATE OF COLOMBIA TO VISIT JAPAN, WAS
INITIALLY SCHEDULED TO DEPART FROM TOKYO FRIDAY EVENING, ENDING HIS
FOUR-DAY OFFICIAL VISIT.

   A TRUCK RIGGED WITH DYNAMITE EXPLODED WEDNESDAY MORNING OUTSIDE A
FEDERAL POLICE BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA, KILLING AT LEAST 23 PEOPLE
AND INJURING 1,000, ACCORDING TO REPORTS FROM COLOMBIA.

   DURING HIS-FOUR DAY STAY IN JAPAN, BARCO MET PRIME MINISTER TOSHIKI
KAIFU AND HAD AN AUDIENCE WITH EMPEROR AKIHITO.

   KAIFU AND BARCO AGREED THAT THE WHOLE WORLD MUST FIGHT AGAINST THE
DRUG PROBLEM AND KAIFU EXPRESSED HIS SUPPORT FOR BARCO IN DEALING WITH

   CLANDESTINE, 12 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE ARE
RECEIVING A REPORT RIGHT NOW ON THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE
REPORT SAYS THAT SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARE
STILL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN].  ARMED FORCES OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME
AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THE REPORT ADDS
THAT AS OF 2140 ON 12 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS STILL TENSION IN THE CITY.

   SOME SPORADIC SHOOTING WAS STILL HEARD, AND THE SITUATION IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY INDICATED THAT OUR COMRADES ARE
MAINTAINING THEIR POSITIONS, THEY ARE CARRYING OUT MILITARY
ENGINEERING TASKS, OPENING TRENCHES, AND SETTING UP BARRICADES WITH
THE COOPERATION OF THE SAN SALVADOR PEOPLE.

   PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THE
CAPITAL CITY, AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING [CHANGES THOUGHT] HERE
IS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, LESS
SHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR
POSITION.  THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING.

   WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT
SOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THERE ARE
MANY VEHICLES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR.  THAT IS
THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WHERE OUR FIGHTERS IN
ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CAPITAL
CITY ARE NOW RECEIVING THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTIFYING
THEMSELVES IN NEIGHBORHOODS.

   WE CALL ON THE SAN SALVADORAN YOUTHS TO GO OUT TONIGHT TO COOPERATE
WITH THE FMLN FIGHTERS.  MAKE THE ASSASSINS OF MSGR ROMERO PAY DEARLY
FOR EVERY STEP THEY TAKE AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN
SAN SALVADOR CITY.  IT HAS BEEN 24, 25, NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLN
FIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THE
REGIME'S INCOMPETENCE.  THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT IS
INCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE A
STATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ON
THE MEDIA.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS
NEWSCASTS.  WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO
NEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR?  WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING?  THIS
IS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE
ANSWER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE
PEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT
BY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

   COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG.
YOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY
OUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS
SAID.

   COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS
YOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIR
COOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN
SALVADOR.  LET'S GO TO THE TOP AND THAT'S IT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 JUN 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MILTON GRIMALDI] [TEXT]
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT DESPITE THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST
SALVADORANS, HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE REBELS.
HE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A
COMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING
WORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE
THE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL
ROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK
THIS MORNING.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE
FMLN:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT
WANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE.  THE FMLN
COMMITTED THIS CRIME.  I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS
ONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT.  WE WILL, OF COURSE,
INVESTIGATE THE CRIME.  I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE
HAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS ACTION.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE
COMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [CRISTIANI] THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH
ACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION.
THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR
PEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK
AND BY APPLYING THE LAW.  THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS
FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY.

   WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION.  TODAY WE
WILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL
ACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS.  THE NAMES OF THE
COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION
IS FULLY FORMED.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS
COMMISSION?

   [CRISTIANI] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE
REPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION
AND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE.  THE
CHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS
TO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD
THIS GOAL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO
PLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE
POLITICAL COMMISSION.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE
ENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT?

   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR
INABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE
OF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE
HAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF
GOVERNMENT [WORD INDISTINCT].  THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER
WAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT
OFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY.  MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC
FINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.  WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN
VERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE
LAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. [END RECORDING]

   CRISTIANI, REFERRING TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS' OFFER TO
HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS IN COSTA RICAN TERRITORY, SAID THAT
THE OFFER WAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD CONVINCING THE FMLN TO STOP
MURDERING DEFENSELESS CITIZENS.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 27 NOV 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [TEXT] TODAY
RESCUE TEAMS, ARMY TROOPS, AND POLICE HAD THE SORRY TASK OF RECOVERING
107 DISFIGURED BODIES OF THE VICTIMS OF AVIANCA'S BOEING 727 THAT
EXPLODED IN MIDAIR IN A SPARSELY POPULATED REGION NEAR BOGOTA.
ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN, THE TASK IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE
THE BODIES WERE SCATTERED OVER A RADIUS OF 8 KM.  THE PLANE DEPARTED
BOGOTA TOWARD CALI, AT 1213 GMT, BUT TWO POWERFUL EXPLOSION BROUGHT IT
DOWN AFTER ONLY 5 MINUTES IN THE AIR.  BOMB-SQUAD EXPERTS, IN
COORDINATION WITH THREE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, HAVE STARTED TO
EXAMINE THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE
TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL FAILURE, OR IF IT WAS A TERRORIST
ACTION.  THE BOGOTA CARACOL NETWORK RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM
THE EXTRADITABLES -- COLOMBIAN DRUG KINGPINS WANTED BY SEVERAL U.S.
FEDERAL COURTS -- WHO SAID THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION.
ANOTHER NETWORK REPORTS THAT THE MAN WHO CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK
NEWS OFFICE SAID HE BELONGED TO THE EXTRADITABLES AND THAT THE ACTION
WAS CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE WERE FIVE INFORMERS ON THE PLANE.  THE
POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT
CAUSED THE PLANE TO CRASH SHORTLY AFTER IT LEFT THE BOGOTA EL DORADO
AIRPORT TO GO TO CALI.

   SAN SALVADOR IS BEING SHAKEN BY STRONG DETONATIONS OF HEAVY WEAPONS

WHERE THE REBELS REPORTEDLY BLEW UP SEVERAL ELECTRICITY POLES WITH

   BOGOTA, 19 MAY 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] OUT OF THE TEN CANDIDATES RUNNING
FOR THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENCY, THE FOUR WHO HAVE THE BEST CHANCES OF
WINNING HAVE INSERTED IN THEIR GOVERNMENT PLATFORMS SOLUTIONS TO THE
CRISIS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS TAKEN HOLD OF THE COUNTRY, CAUSED MAINLY
BY THE NARCOTRAFFICKING MAFIAS AND THE GUERRILLA GROUPS.

   FOR LIBERAL CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO, "NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS" MUST BE
FOUND THROUGH A CONDITIONED DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS AND BY
STRENGTHENING JUSTICE TO CONFRONT THE NARCOTRAFFICKERS "BECAUSE
EXTRADITION CANNOT BE THE ONLY PATH TO FIGHT THIS CRIME."

   GAVIRIA, 43, WHO ACCORDING TO THE POLLS IS THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED
VIRGILIO BARCO AS PRESIDENT AFTER THE 27 MAY ELECTIONS, HAS MADE THE
PROBLEMS OF THE GUERRILLAS AND DRUG MAFIAS THE TWO MAIN ISSUES IN HIS
GOVERNMENT PLATFORM.

   REGARDING THE ARMED REBELS, HE INSISTS THAT NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS
MUST BE FOUND AND PROMISES TO "TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION" THE MERITS OF
WHAT HAS BEEN TESTED UP TO NOW.

   "THE DIALOGUE WITH THE ARMED REBELS IS A CONCESSION THAT HAS BEEN
MADE TO THEM, AND FOR THIS REASON SOCIETY HAS EVERY RIGHT TO ESTABLISH
CONDITIONS," GAVIRIA STATED.  "THUS," HE ADDED, "THE DIALOGUE WILL
PREVENT THE GUERRILLAS FROM HAVING A POLITICAL PROTAGONIST ROLE AND
WILL AVERT THE JUSTIFICATION OF VIOLENCE."

   SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE RODRIGO LLOREDA CAICEDO, 47, INSISTS THAT "THE
SURRENDER OF THE MAFIA LORDS MUST BE ACHIEVED" AND THAT THIS "SHOULD
INCLUDE PENALTIES FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED, ECONOMIC COMPENSATION, AND
THE CERTAINTY THAT COLOMBIA WILL NOT CONTINUE TO LEND ITSELF TO
PRODUCE AND EXPORT DRUGS."

   LLOREDA CAICEDO IS OPPOSED TO THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS
TO THE UNITED STATES, AND HE OFFERS TO "STRENGTHEN JUSTICE" AND TO
CHANGE PROCEDURES SO AS TO SURROUND JUDGES WITH GUARANTEES, ALL WITHIN
THE FRAMEWORK OF A CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THROUGH A PLEBISCITE TO
CONVOKE A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.

   FOR THE ARMED REBELS, HE OFFERS "A 12-MONTH TERM FOR THEM TO REJOIN
CIVILIAN LIFE" AND THE DRAFTING OF "MECHANISMS" FOR THEIR DISBANDING,
SUCH AS THE "NATIONAL CIRCUMSCRIPTION" THAT WILL FACILITATE THEIR
PARTICIPATION IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC AND POLITICAL LIFE.

   LLOREDA CAICEDO, FOREIGN MINISTER DURING BELISARIO BETANCUR'S
ADMINISTRATION AND ONE OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE CONTADORA GROUP TO
ATTAIN PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID THAT AN EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO
"RECOVER THE MONOPOLY OF THE PUBLIC FORCE AND CONSOLIDATE ITS
SOVEREIGN PRESENCE."

   ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO, 71, A "DISSIDENT" CONSERVATIVE, MAINTAINS
THAT WITHOUT THE STRENGTHENING OF MORALS AND THE LAW -- "THE ROOT OF
OUR ILLS" -- COEXISTENCE AND PROGRESS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE.  HE
PLEDGES TO RESCUE THOSE TWO VALUES.

   GOMEZ HURTADO PRESENTED TO COLOMBIAN VOTERS A FIVE-POINT "AGREEMENT
ON BASIC ISSUES," INCLUDING LAW AND MORALS, JUSTICE, ECONOMIC
PLANNING, AND ECOLOGY, AS HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM IF HE IS ELECTED
PRESIDENT ON 27 MAY.

   ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, THE M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE, WHO REPLACED THE ASSASSINATED CARLOS PIZARRO, BELIEVES THAT
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM ARE "BASIC" TO REACHING PEACE.

   NAVARRO WOLFF, 41, HAS REITERATED THAT HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE
EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND HE ALSO CONDEMNED THE CHAIN OF
ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY DRUG TERRORISTS IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST
FEW MONTHS.

   REGARDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT THEY REQUIRE
"MORE SERIOUS TREATMENT."  THEREFORE, IT IS BETTER TO HAVE "A POOR
DIALOGUE RATHER THAN A GOOD WAR," AND IF THAT DIALOGUE PRODUCES GOOD
RESULTS "WE MUST HOLD ON TO IT," HE SAID.

   THE FOUR CANDIDATES AGREE ON REFORMING THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC
AND THE CONSTITUTION BY CONVOKING A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.
THEY ALSO SHARE OPINIONS ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC OPENING TOWARD
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, ACCESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND PROMOTION OF
AN "AGRO-INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION" WHICH WILL GUARANTEE A REDUCTION OR
STABILIZATION OF THE RATE OF INFLATION.

ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAS AGAIN RECEIVED
DEATH THREATS THROUGH HIS SECRETARIES AND THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S COOKS,
"BUT I FEEL AT PEACE AND THAT I AM IN GOD'S HANDS," THE PASTOR SAID.

   RIVERA Y DAMAS ADMITTED, NEVERTHELESS, THAT GENERALIZED PERSECUTION
OF THE CHURCH HAS DIMINISHED, ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT DISAPPEARED, AND
ADDED THAT OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS MANY PRIESTS HAVE BEEN KILLED,
INCLUDING AN ARCHBISHOP, "BUT THE BLOOD OF MARTYRS IS THE SEED OF
CHRISTIANS," HE SAID.

   RIVERA Y DAMAS POINTED OUT THAT HE HAS RECEIVED MANY COMPLAINTS
CONCERNING THE CHURCH'S POSITION ON THE JESUITS' MURDER, BUT TODAY "IT
IS KNOWN THAT THE ARCHBISHOPRIC WAS RIGHT TO POINT OUT WHERE IT
BELIEVED THE MURDERERS WERE.  THIS POSITION WAS CONFIRMED BY PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WHO, BY FULFILLING HIS PROMISE TO GET TO THE VERY
BOTTOM OF THE CASE THROUGH INVESTIGATIONS, HAS BECOME WORTHY OF
WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION."

   IN ANOTHER PART OF HIS HOMILY RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID TODAY THAT "TO BE
BISHOP OF A PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED THE SCOURGE OF A FRATRICIDAL WAR
FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS IMPLIES HAVING VERY DEEPLY ROOTED MERCY FOR
HUMAN PAIN, WHICH MUST TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER ANY POLITICAL, ECONOMIC,
OR IDEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND IS AN IRREVOCABLE PLEDGE."

   THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT ECLESSIASTICAL
EVENTS OF THE WEEK IN SAN SALVADOR WERE THE SALVADORAN EPISCOPAL
CONFERENCE, WHICH CONCLUDED WITH A CALL FOR PEACE, AND THE CONSIGNMENT
TO COURTS OF JUSTICE OF THE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF MURDERING THE JESUIT
PRIESTS.

   THERE WAS SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE MEETING, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT
WAS KNOWN THAT A LETTER HAD BEEN SENT TO THE BISHOPS BY THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, REQUESTING THE CHURCH'S
MEDIATION AND ITS EFFORTS TO RESUME A DIALOGUE.  "I BELIEVE," MSGR
RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID, "THAT THE MEETINGS OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI
AND THE FMLN WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL ARE IMPORTANT."

   TO CONCLUDE, RIVERA Y DAMAS REITERATED THAT "WE MUST END THIS WAR
THROUGH DIALOGUE AND RATIONAL MEANS BEFORE THE WAR FINISHES US ALL."

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN
COMMANDER GONZALEZ BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[REPORTER] COMMANDER, WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT, THE LABOR UNIONS,
AND THE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS DO IN THE FACE OF A GOVERNMENT AND
A MILITARY LEADERSHIP THAT CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF ATTACK, THIS TYPE OF
MASSACRE, IN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT OFFERS NO GUARANTEE TO THE POPULAR
MOVEMENT?  WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT DO?

   [GONZALEZ] I BELIEVE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING ALL
THE ROADS TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THIS CONFLICT.  THROUGH REPRESSION
IT IS CLOSING OFF THE POSSIBILITY OF LABOR UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS
RESOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS PEACEFULLY.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING OFF
THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS.  THE ARMY AND THE CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT ARE OPPOSED TO TRUE NEGOTIATIONS.  THE PEOPLE HAVE NO
ALTERNATIVE.  IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS A LATENT PATH, THE PATH OF ARMED
ACTIONS.  AT THIS MOMENT, AS THIS GOVERNMENT INCREASES REPRESSION,
ARMED ACTIONS BECOME INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, ARMED ACTIONS TO FIND
SOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT, ARMED ACTIONS TO STOP THE REPRESSION BY THE
REGIME.

   THE WORKERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND LABOR UNIONS ARE ENTITLED TO
DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR LABOR BENEFITS.  DEFENSE IS LEGITIMATE.
IT IS LEGITIMATE FOR THE WORKERS TO DECIDE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THE
ARMED WAY, THROUGH VIOLENCE.  IT IS THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, PONCE,
AND THE HIGH COMMAND WHO ARE LEAVING THE WORKERS NO ALTERNATIVE.

   [REPORTER] TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER: IN RECENT HOURS THERE HAVE BEEN
ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL, INCLUDING BOMB ATTACKS ON THE RESIDENCES OF
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS SUCH AS RUBEN ZAMORA AND ARONETE DIAZ, AN ATTACK ON
THE RESIDENCE OF COLONEL CARRANZA, AND AN ATTACK ON A RELATIVE OF
COLONEL LOPEZ HUILA, AMONG OTHERS.  THE ARMED FORCES AND THE
GOVERNMENT HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE
ATTACKS.

   [GONZALEZ] OUR ARMED ACTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUST AND HAVE POLITICAL
MOTIVATIONS.  OUR OBJECTIVES ARE STRICTLY MILITARY.  ALL OUR GUERRILLA
UNITS FUNCTION ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, BE IT IN THE RURAL AREAS
OR IN THE CITIES WHERE OUR URBAN COMMANDOS OPERATE.

   THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES STAFF INSTALLATIONS AND OTHER
OPERATIONS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY.  THE
FMLN'S POLICY IS NOT TO ATTACK RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN OR
POLITICIANS.  THE HIGH COMMAND HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE THE PEOPLE
HERE AND ABROAD.  WHAT IS ITS OBJECTIVE?  TO COVER UP ITS REPRESSIVE
POLICY.  IT IS ESCALATING ITS ACTIONS.  IT HAS GONE FROM THE SELECTIVE
CAPTURE AND MURDER OF LEADERS TO MASS ARRESTS, AND FROM MASS ARRESTS
IT HAS MOVED INTO GENOCIDE AND INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS.

   IT IS CLEAR THAT ITS OBJECTIVE IS THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE
GOVERNMENT SAID IT IN SAN JOSE.  IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HIGH COMMAND
IS TRYING TO CREATE CONFUSION, BUT THE PEOPLE ABROAD AND WE KNOW THAT
OUR ACTIONS ARE AIMED AT MILITARY OBJECTIVES.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 18 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE
GUATEMALAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL MAKE THE
GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AND THE GUATEMALAN ARMY "PAY
DEARLY" FOR HAVING "INTERVENED" IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.

   A COMMUNIQUE BY THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG),
RELEASED IN COSTA RICA, STRESSED THAT 126 ELITE TROOPS OF THE
GUATEMALAN ARMY, KNOWN AS KAIBILES, ARE COLLABORATING WITH SALVADORAN
SOLDIERS TO PUT AN END TO THE OFFENSIVE BY GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).

   THE URNG CHARGE, ALSO PRESENTED BY THE FMLN, HAS BEEN CATEGORICALLY
AND REPEATEDLY DENIED BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESWOMAN CLAUDIA
ARENAS.

   THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE STATED: "WE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE
INTERVENTION OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.  WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY
FOR THIS AGGRESSION."

   THE NOTE WAS RELEASED SHORTLY AFTER SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THE VICTORY OF HIS COUNTRY'S ARMY OVER THE FMLN,
FOLLOWING FIERCE FIGHTING THAT LEFT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DEAD AND MORE
THAN 1,500 WOUNDED IN THE PAST 7 DAYS.

   IN ADDITION, THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY "WITH
THE COMMUNITY OF JESUIT PRIESTS" AND THEIR SORROW BECAUSE OF THE
KILLING OF SIX OF THEIR MEMBERS, INCLUDING CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
RECTOR IGNACIO ELLACURIA AND TWO WOMEN, CARRIED OUT BY UNIFORMED MEN
IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   THE URNG DECLARATION IS SIGNED BY COMMANDERS ROLANDO MORAN, GASPAR
ILOM, AND PABLO MONSANTO.

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE EXTRADITABLES, THE ARMED
BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, DENIED TODAY IN A TELEPHONE CALL TO A
RADIO STATION BY AN ALLEGED MEMBER, ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATH
OF CARLOS PIZARRO, POLITICAL LEADER AND FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER.

   THE CALLER IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS JOHN JAIRO ARIAS TASCON.  HE
CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK IN MEDELLIN TO DENOUNCE THAT THE CHARGES
AGAINST THE MEDELLIN CARTEL ARE PART OF A PLAN TO BLAME THEM FOR ALL
VIOLENT ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY.

   THE AUTHORS OF THE ASSASSINATION ARE SECTORS WHO SEEK TO
DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY, ARIAS TASCON ADDED.

   PIZARRO, FORMER LEADER OF THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), THE
GUERRILLA GROUP THAT LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH, WAS KILLED BY
THE IMPACT OF THREE BULLETS FIRED AT HIM ABOARD A COLOMBIAN AVIANCA
FLIGHT THAT WAS EN ROUTE TO THE CITY OF BARRANQUILLA ALONG THE
COUNTRY'S ATLANTIC COAST.

   AFTER THE CRIME, AT 1100 (1600 GMT), AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IDENTIFIED
HIMSELF AS SAPATOCA CALLED CARACOL TO REPORT THAT THE KILLING HAD BEEN
ORDERED BY FIDEL CASTANO AND HENRY PEREZ, HEADS OF THE EXTREME
RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY MILITIAS.

   SAPATOCA ADDED THAT CASTANO AND PEREZ PERPETRATED THE CRIME
FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM THE EXTRADITABLES.

   CASTANO WAS CONNECTED TO THE DEATH OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO, ALSO A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FOR THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION (UP), ON 22
MARCH, ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME IT WAS REPORTED THAT CASTANO HEADED A
PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT DID NOT IMPLICATE THE EXTRADITABLES.

   ON THAT OCCASION PABLO ESCOBAR, LEADER OF THE EXTRADITABLES AND THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL, DENIED THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD KILLED
JARAMILLO.

   A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT DRAFTED RECENTLY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS, COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE), SAID THAT SOME
ARMY AND POLICE MEMBERS COOPERATE WITH CASTANO'S CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATION.

   NAVARRO WOLFF, NUMBER TWO LEADER OF M-19, TOLD NEWSMEN TODAY AFTER
PIZARRO WAS KILLED THAT HIS BURIAL MUST BE ATTENDED BY ALL THE
COUNTRY, BECAUSE WE MUST REPUDIATE CRIME SUCH AS THIS.

   NAVARRO WOLFF SAID THAT PIZARRO'S DEATH SHOWS THAT THE COUNTRY IS
IN TURMOIL AND THAT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY.
THERE IS NO SPACE EXCEPT FOR PAIN AND FOR IRE, HE ADDED.

   THE BURIAL OF CARLOS MUST BE PEACEFUL, AS WAS M-19'S EXAMPLE OF
PEACE GIVEN TO THE COUNTRY, HE ADDED.

   IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN HOW THINGS SUCH AS THIS OCCUR WHEN THE M-19
AND CARLOS PIZARRO WERE SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF PRUDENCE, TOLERANCE, AND
UNDERSTANDING, NAVARRO SAID.

   PIZARRO, A FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER WHO LED HIS ARMED GROUP
TOWARD DEMOBILIZATION AFTER 17 MONTHS OF POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH
THE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO BARCO, TOLD NEWSMEN BEFORE BOARDING THE
AIRCRAFT: WE ARE DOING WELL. THIS WAS A REFERENCE TO THE M-19
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.

   PIZARRO STATED IN HIS LAST PUBLIC STATEMENT: I AM CERTAIN THAT WE
WILL KNOW HOW TO WAGE OPPOSITION.  WE WILL ENGAGE IN A VERY PRETTY
DEMOCRATIC PLAY WITH REGARD TO THE NEXT GOVERNMENT.  WE WILL
PARTICIPATE IN BUILDING NEW COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY.

   THE M-19 PARTICIPATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE 11 MARCH ELECTIONS,
BECOMING THE THIRD POLITICAL FORCE IN BOGOTA.

   NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID YET CONCERNING THE BURIAL OF PIZARRO, WHO WAS
BORN 39 YEARS AGO IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS AND WHO LEAVES THREE ORPHAN
DAUGHTERS, AGED 12, 9, AND 4.

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF OF
THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, BY UNIDENTIFIED SALVADORAN AND
INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] COLONEL, WHAT
SPECIFIC MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AGAINST THE MISSILES?

   [PONCE] I BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED HAVE GIVEN
US GOOD RESULTS.  THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCA
AREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS OR
MISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT.  WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES
THAT ARE GIVING RESULTS.  WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE
THE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL
LANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE
CRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA.  THANK GOD, [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE
FMLN?  DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS
TOWARD A DIALOGUE?

   [PONCE] YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO
TALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS.  I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A
POSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD.

   HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN
AN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES IS
REPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY.  WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT
THE FMLN.

   BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVE
INFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED
AND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES.  WE HAVE CONFISCATED A
LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS.  I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25
ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12
CARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS,
45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23
RADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES.

   I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH
SUPPPORT FROM ABROAD.  IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL.

   I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN
ABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS.  WE HAVE
ALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OF
YOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELL
AS IN CHALATENANGO.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS.  THIS ALSO MEANS
THAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW.

   [REPORTER] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A
LEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND
ALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS.  THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORAN
PATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND, THEIR PROPERTIES, AND LIVES.  IT
ALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY, TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED, AS WELL AS
THEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET?
IS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY?

   [PONCE] I DO NOT THINK SO, BECAUSE THE LEAFLETS MENTION
INTERNATIONALISTS, WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONG WITH THE FMLN.  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, 22 JUL 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] IN CONNECTION WITH
THE BOMB ATTACK ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY [UCA] AT DAYBREAK
ON 22 JULY, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]
STATES THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THIS ACT IS PART OF THE POLICY OF TERROR THAT THE NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] GOVERNMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED IN AN ATTEMPT
TO DISCOURAGE ALL TYPES OF OPPOSITION TO THE ANTIPOPULAR AND
ANTIDEMOCRATIC MEASURES THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING.  WITHIN THIS
FRAMEWORK, WE HAVE: THE SIEGE ON THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, THREATS
AGAINST TEACHERS AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCREASING
REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLES' MOVEMENT.

   2.  THE ATTACK IS CLEARLY INTENDED TO CAUSE UNREST AMONG THE
PARTICIPANTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SOLIDARITY CONFERENCE OF
SISTER TRADE UNIONS THAT BEGAN TODAY AT THE UCA.

   3.  WE, THEREFORE, HOLD ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FOCES HIGH COMMAND RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS NEW TERRORIST ATTACK.

   4.  WE STRONGLY CONDEMN THE ATTACK ON THE UCA AND CALL UPON ALL
INTERESTED PARTIES TO JOIN FORCES TO CONFRONT ARENA'S TERRORIST
POLICIES.

NOTIFIES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, SPECIFICALLY THOSE LIVING IN THE
ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA OF SAN SALVADOR, THAT THEY SHOULD NOT HEED
RUMORS CIRCULATING TO THE EFFECT THAT THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA
WILL BE BOMBED.  THIS IS FALSE.  ANY ACTIONS AGAINST INTERNATIONAL
TERRORISM WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN DUE TIME.  THE RESIDENTS OF ESCALON
SHOULD REST ASSURED AND NOT LEAVE THEIR HOMES.

   LIMA, 19 JAN 89 -- [TEXT] TWO SUBVERSIVES WERE KILLED AND A
POLICEMAN WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN A SHOOT-OUT EARLY THIS MORNING NEAR
THE SAN CARLOS SERVICE STATION IN CANTO GRANDE.  THE SHOOT-OUT
OCCURRED WHEN A POLICE PATROL INTERCEPTED FOUR SUSPECTS IN THE AREA OF
THE SERVICE STATION.  POLICEMAN JOSE FELIX AGUIRRE WAS SERIOUSLY
WOUNDED BY A BULLET IN THE CHEST AND ANOTHER IN THE ARM.  HE WAS TAKEN
TO THE POLICE HOSPITAL.

   TWO OF THE WOUNDED SUBVERSIVES DIED LATER AT THE RIMAC HOSPITAL
WHERE THEY WERE TAKEN BY THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE.  THE
OTHER SUBVERSIVES ESCAPED.  POLICE SOURCES STATED THAT THE SUBVERSIVES
WERE PLANNING TO BLOW UP THE SERVICE STATION BECAUSE A BLUEPRINT OF
THE STATION WAS FOUND IN THEIR POSSESSION.  IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT
THAT THE SUBVERSIVES USED FIREARMS WITH SILENCERS.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 29 MAY 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS
TODAY STATED THAT CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS WERE KILLED ON SATURDAY
DURING AN ARMED CLASH BETWEEN THE HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN ARMIES.

   THROUGH A COMMUNIQUE, THE GUERRILLAS EMPHASIZED THE ARMED CLASH
TOOK PLACE AFTER HONDURAN ARMY TROOPS ATTACKED IN THE HAMLET OF SAN
ANDRES, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, IN NORTHERN EL SALVADOR.

   MEMBERS OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY ARCE BATTALION, WHO WERE
CONDUCTING AN OPERATION NEAR THE HONDURAN BORDER, RESPONDED, SUPPORTED
BY TWO AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS.

   THE REPORT BY THE REBELS, BROADCAST FROM SAN SALVADOR BY
TEGUCIGALPA RADIO AMERICA, ADDED THAT AN UNNAMED ARCE BATTALION
OFFICER WAS KILLED IN THE CLASH.

   THE HONDURAN TROOPS THEN RETREATED TO LOS LLANITOS, INTIBUCA
DEPARTMENT, IN HONDURAS, WHERE FOUR SALVADORAN HELICOPTERS LANDED,
ACCORDING TO THE FMLN.

   THE REPORT ADDED THAT AS A HONDURAN HELICOPTER EVACUATED THE
WOUNDED, IT WAS ATTACKED AND PURSUED 7 KM INSIDE HONDURAN TERRITORY BY
A SALVADORAN AIRCRAFT FIRING ROCKETS AND MACHINEGUNS.

   THE HONDURAN SOLDIERS WERE SURROUNDED IN LOS LLANITOS AND TAKEN
PRISONER.

   THE FMLN STATED THAT SEVERAL HOMES WERE DAMAGED AND THAT ANIMALS
WERE KILLED IN THE SURROUNDING HAMLETS AND VILLAGES.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA NOTED THAT IT HAD PREVIOUSLY WARNED THAT
THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE HONDURAN ARMY "DUE TO U.S. DISPOSITIONS" IN THE
EL SALVADOR WAR, WOULD RESULT IN CLASHES AMONG THE ARMIES OF CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRIES.

   THE FMLN REPORT STATES THAT "IT IS NO SECRET THAT THE OLIGARCHS WHO
[WILL ] REACH POWER THROUGH THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
(ARENA) GOVERNMENT ARE THE SAME PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE 1969 INVASION
OF HONDURAS."

   THE OFFICERS, WHO AT THAT TIME "WERE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
KILLINGS, PILLAGING, AND OUTRAGES AGAINST THE HONDURAN PEOPLE, ARE
TODAY MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES LEADERSHIP," THE
COMMUNIQUE ADDS.

   ACCORDING TO THE FMLN, SATURDAY'S CLASH "WILL SET THE TONE THAT
DEFINES THE BORDER CONFLICT FOR A GOVERNMENT OF OLIGARCHS THAT HAS
ALWAYS HAD AN EXPANSIONIST ATTITUDE TOWARD HONDURAS."

   [THE COMMUNIQUE] ALSO REQUESTS THAT THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES NOT
GET INVOLVED IN A WAR FOREIGN TO THEM.

   THE HONDURAN MILITARY HAS NEITHER DENIED NOR CONFIRMED THE
SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS REPORTS, AND AN ARMY SPOKESMAN HAS STATED THAT
INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED.

   THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES, HAVE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, REPORTED THAT
THE GUERRILLAS HAVE "HIDEOUTS" IN SALVADORAN REFUGEE CAMPS, AND
CONTINUOUSLY ENTER HONDURAN TERRITORY TO REST OR FOR RESUPPLY OF
WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION.

   BOGOTA, 22 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] DEFENSE
MINISTER GENERAL OSCAR BOTERO RESTREPO DISCLOSED THIS AFTERNOON THAT
MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION
OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF PATRIOTIC UNION,
UP.

   BOTERO SAID THAT INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT ESCOBAR
GAVIRIA PLANNED AND ORDERED THE ATTACK ON JARAMILLO OSSA.  GEN. BOTERO
TOLD REPORTERS THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CONTRACTED THE SERVICES OF AN
ORGANIZATION OF HIRED ASSASSINS AND SENT THEM TO BOGOTA TO ASSASSINATE
THE UP LEADER.

   HE ADDED THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA ORDERED THE DELIVERY OF AN INITIAL
SUM OF 300,000 PESOS TO A THIRD PERSON AFTER THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED
AT EL DORADO AIRPORT'S PEDESTRIAN OVERPASS IN BOGOTA.

   THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID THAT MINUTES AFTER THE KILLING THE DAS
[ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] INTELLIGENCE SERVICE
INTERCEPTED AN ESCOBAR GAVIRIA CONVERSATION IN MEDELLIN.  HE WAS
ORDERING HIS ACCOMPLICES TO PAY 300,000 PESOS TO A THIRD PERSON LINKED
TO THE PAID ASSASSIN WHO KILLED THE UP LEADER.

   BOTERO ALSO DISCLOSED THAT THE ASSASSIN IS A 16-YEAR-OLD YOUTH WHO
CARRIED A FALSE IDENTIFICATION CARD UNDER THE NAME OF JAIRO ALBERTO
RESTREPO POSADA.

   MEANWHILE, ANONYMOUS CALLS WERE RECEIVED BY VARIOUS BOGOTA MEDIA
TODAY.  THE CALLERS WERE ATTRIBUTING THE ATTACK ON UP LEADER JARAMILLO
OSSA TO A SO-CALLED GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA COMMANDO GROUP. IN THESE
CALLS, IT WAS SAID THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DECIDED TO RESUME THE WAR
BECAUSE FOR FIVE MONTHS IT OFFERED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE VIRGILIO
BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT, AND THE ONLY RESPONSE IT RECEIVED WAS TO URGE
CARTEL MEMBERS TO TURN THEMSELVES IN TO JUSTICE.

   IN ADDITION, THREATS WERE MADE AGAINST OTHER COLOMBIAN POLITICAL
FIGURES SUCH AS LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATE CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO. THE
CALLERS SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES RELEASED KIDNAPPED PEOPLE,
DELIVERED LABORATORIES, AND LARGE QUANTITIES OF DYNAMITE AS PROOF OF
THEIR INTENTION TO TALK, BUT THEY NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY FROM THE
GOVERNMENT.

   THE CALLERS SAID: WE ARE GOING TO TURN OURSELVES IN, BUT WE WILL BE
DEAD WHEN WE DO SO.  HOWEVER, BEFORE THIS HAPPENS, THEY SAID, THE
COUNTRY WILL SEE THE BODIES OF ITS LEADERS, JUST AS IN THE CASE OF
JARAMILLO OSSA.

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] FRANCISCO
MERINO, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND INTERIOR MINISTER, HAS
STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF FORMER SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO.  MERINO DESCRIBED THE CULPRITS AS MURDEROUS
BEASTS.

   THE VICE PRESIDENT WENT TO THE MEDICAL-SURGICAL HOSPITAL OF THE
SALVADORAN INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, TO WHICH DR GUERRERO WAS
TAKEN AFTER THE ATTACK.  GUERRERO, WHO WAS AN ADVISER TO THE
GOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT TO THE DIALOGUE [COMISION DE APOYO
GUBERNAMENTAL DE DIALOGO], WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TERRORISTS AT THE
INTERSECTION OF BOULEVARD DE LOS HEROES AND ALAMEDA JUAN PABLO II.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WHAT THEY ARE SHOWING IS THAT THEY ARE
BENT ON CARRYING OUT TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS TO LOWER THE
CONFIDENCE OF THE POPULATION AND TO PROVOKE GENERAL PANIC.  I THINK
THAT ALTHOUGH AS A GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED A CONCILIATORY
POSITION TO ATTAIN PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WE MUST ALSO MAKE A FIRMER
DECISION TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION.  THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE WANTON
ACTIONS ARE DERANGED PEOPLE.  THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WORDS.  THEY DO
NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST RESPECT A LEGAL SYSTEM, OR A DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS OR ONE OF HUMANIZATION.  THEY ARE SIMPLY BEASTS AND MURDERERS
AND MUST BE TREATED AS SUCH.  [END RECORDING]

   MERINO SAID THE MURDERERS MUST BE PUNISHED WITH THE FULL WEIGHT OF
THE LAWS, AND THAT ONE OF THE TERRORISTS WHO WAS WOUNDED AND CAPTURED
AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME IS UNDER INTERROGATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] ONE OF THE CRIMINALS WAS WOUNDED.  THIS
WILL OBVIOUSLY ENABLE US TO OBTAIN SOME CLUES AS TO THE IDENTITY OF
THE ACTUAL KILLERS AND OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THIS NEW MURDER, WHICH
HAS SHOCKED SALVADORAN SOCIETY.

   AS IN PREVIOUS CASES, WE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS
CASE.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO TAKE A
FIRMER STAND, TO DO OUR UTMOST, AND TO REALIZE THAT IF NOTHING HAS
HAPPENED TO US THUS FAR, IT DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL NOT FALL VICTIM TO
THESE MURDERERS.  IT IS BETTER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS NOW THAN TO HAVE
REGRETS LATER.  [END RECORDING]

   MERINO SAID THAT THIS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY THE
TERRORIST HORDES HAS NOT ENDED.  CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THIS BRUTAL
AND COWARDLY MURDER, WHICH HAS AGAIN FILLED THE SUFFERING SALVADORAN
PEOPLE WITH SORROW.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 22 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] FIVE GUATEMALAN
UNIVERSITY LEADERS THREATENED WITH DEATH HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN PANAMA,
COSTA RICA, AND MEXICO, WHILE UN HUMAN RIGHTS OBSERVER PETER KOOIJMANS
IS IN GUATEMALA CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION ON THE INCREASING VIOLENCE
IN THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT ASSOCIATION [AEU] OF
SAN CARLOS DE GUATEMALA UNIVERSITY, THE STUDENTS LEADERS DECIDED TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS THREATS OF DEATH AND
PERSECUTION AND DUE TO THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF FIVE
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.

   THE NAMES OF THE STUDENTS WHO FLED THE COUNTRY ARE BEING KEPT
SECRET TO PROTECT THEIR RELATIVES WHO LIVE IN GUATEMALA CITY AND IN
THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY, THE SOURCES MAINTAINED.

   THREE OF THE STUDENTS TRAVELED TO PANAMA, ONE TO MEXICO, AND
ANOTHER TO COSTA RICA.

   THIS MONTH, THE CORPSES OF FIVE ASSASSINATED AEU LEADERS WERE FOUND
IN THE CAPITAL, SOME WITH SIGNS OF TORTURE.  SIX OTHER UNIVERSITY
STUDENT LEADERS REMAIN KIDNAPPED.

   BELISARIO POLO, STUDENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
PANAMA, TODAY TOLD EFE THAT THE THREE AEU LEADERS ARRIVED IN THE
COUNTRY LAST WEEKEND AND ARE LIVING IN PRIVATE HOUSES.

   GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAID THEY HAVE NO OFFICIAL REPORTS
ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE HIGHEST AEU LEADERS.

   THE DEPARTURE OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEADERS COINCIDES
WITH THE VISIT TO GUATEMALA OF PETER KOOIJMANS, WHO YESTERDAY MET
GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND ARMY
OFFICERS TO GATHER INFORMATION.

   DURING HIS MEETING WITH GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO VALLE,
KOOIJMANS REQUESTED REPORTS ON THE INVESTIGATIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS
CONDUCTED ON THE CASE OF THE KIDNAPPED STUDENTS, THE GUATEMALAN
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.

   THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
AND THE THREATS AGAINST OTHER AEU MEMBERS HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED BY
LEADERS FROM UNIVERSITIES IN MEXICO, HONDURAS, PERU, COLOMBIA, COSTA
RICA, EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA, AND PANAMA.

   UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEADERS FROM CANADA, ECUADOR, CHILE, AND THE
FRG HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY AND DEMANDED THAT THE GUATEMALAN
GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE THESE ASSASSINATIONAS.

   THE AEU REQUESTED THE HIGHER UNIVERSITY COUNCIL TO SUSPEND CLASSES
FOR THE CURRENT SEMESTER IN VIEW OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE GUATEMALA IS
SUFFERING AND IN VIEW OF THE DEATH THREATS AGAINST THE MAIN STUDENT
LEADERS.  AS A RESPONSE, THE CSU HAS DECIDED TO LET EACH ACADEMIC
SECTION DECIDE THE STRATEGY IT WILL IMPLEMENT TO GET PROTECTION FROM
THE VIOLENCE. SEVERAL OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOLS HAVE MODIFIED
THE EVENING SCHEDULE, AND MOST CLASSES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO 2-HOURS
PERIODS SO STUDENTS CAN RETURN HOME EARLY.

   SEVERAL LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CONDEMNED THE KIDNAPPING AND
ASSASSINATION ON 15 SEPTEMBER OF EDUARDO ANTONIO LOPEZ PALENCIA, A
STUDENT WHOSE CORPSE SHOWED SIGNS OF TORTURE.

   CLANDESTINE, 7 FEB 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE FREE ELECTIONS IN A COUNTRY WHERE
REPRESSION PREVAILS.  IN AN INDISPUTABLE EFFORT OF CLEAR FLEXIBILITY
AND WILLINGNESS FOR PEACE, THE FMLN PRESENTED A PEACE PROPOSAL TO JOSE
NAPOLEON DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HIGH
COMMAND.  THAT PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT TURNING ELECTIONS INTO A
CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE.

   TWO WEEKS HAVE PASSED SINCE WE PRESENTED OUR PROPOSAL, AND NEITHER
THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE ARMED FORCES HAVE OFFICIALLY RESPONDED TO THE
FMLN INITIATIVE.  THAT INITIATIVE HAS HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND OF OUR COUNTRY'S LARGEST GROUPS.

   NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE RESPONDED TO THE
PEOPLE'S OUTCRY AND WORLD EXPECTATIONS, WHICH ARE AWAITING A POSITIVE
RESPONSE TO OUR PROPOSAL.

   ON THE CONTRARY, THE GOVERNMENT, ITS ARMED FORCES, AND THE MEMBERS
OF THEIR SQUADS DISGUISED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES CONTINUE THEIR DIRTY WAR
AGAINST THE PEOPLES MOVEMENT AND THEIR WIDESPREAD WAR IN THE
COUNTRYSIDE.

   THE NATIONAL GUARD [WORD INDISTINCT] MURDERED UNIVERSITY STUDENT
MARIO FLORES, WHOSE BODY WAS LEFT ON A HIGHWAY NEAR THE PORT OF
ACAJUTLA.  MEANWHILE, NATIONAL POLICE MEMBERS WHO WERE DRESSED IN
CIVILIAN CLOTHES SEIZED UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HUGO MARTINEZ AND RAUL
RAMIREZ, WHO ARE STILL MISSING.

   JAIME ESTEVEZ, A MEMBER OF THE BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM
MOVEMENT [MPTL] WAS TAKEN TO THE USULUTAN JAIL TO BE MURDERED AND THE
CRIME WAS SUPPOSED TO GO UNNOTICED.

   MEANWHILE, ACCORDING TO REPORTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL
FEDERATION OF AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK COOPERATIVES, FENACOA, ON 31
JANUARY, OROMONTIQUE BATTALION TROOPS OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE
COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT PACHECHO MURDERED PEASANTS VICTOR MANUEL
VASQUEZ AND RAFAEL ROMERO.  THE TROOPS FAKED A CLASH AT HORCONES DE
BERLIN CANTON TO MURDER THOSE PEASANTS.

   ON 4 JANUARY, LUCIA AND MARIA ASUNCION ROMERO, AND MINOR PEDRO
GONZALEZ ERAZO WERE CAPTURED AT THE AHUACHAPAN BUS STATION BY ARMY
TROOPS COMMANDED BY MURDERER COLONEL CANAS.

   THE PEASANT COMMUNAL ASSOCIATION, ACC, CONTINUES TO DEMAND THE
RELEASE OF PEASANTS BARTOLO RODRIGUEZ, WHO WAS CAPTURED ON 27 JANUARY,
AND [NAME INDISTINCT] CAPTURED ON 2 FEBRUARY BY TROOPS OF COLONAL
ORLANDO MONTANO OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE.

   THE NONGOVERNMENTAL SALVADORAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION REPORTED THE
SEIZURE OF MACLOVIA GONZALEZ, VIRGILIO ORTIZ CRUZ, AND VIRGILIO ORTIZ,
WHO WERE CAPTURED ON 4 JANUARY BY MILITARY DETACHMENT NO 4 TROOPS AT
EL MAYUELO CANTON, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.  THEIR WHEREABOUTS ARE STILL
UNKNOWN.

   THE MPTL ALSO REPORTED THAT ROBERTO MENA WAS CAPTURED BY ATONAL
BATTALION TROOPS AT 1600 ON 5 FEBRUARY.

   THERE CANNOT BE FREE AND CLEAN ELECTIONS IN THIS ATMOSPHERE OF
REPRESSION.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY HIGH COMMAND CONTINUE
TERRIFYING AND KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE PEOPLES' WILL
CANNOT BE EXPRESSED THROUGH THEIR VOTE WITH SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE OF
REPRESSION, ESPECIALLY IF THE GROUPS DISPUTING POWER ARE A BUNCH OF
MURDERERS AND CORRUPT MEN.

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE CANNOT BUT
THANK YOU AND RECOGNIZE THE WAY IN WHICH YOU ARE BEARING THE FMLN
AGGRESSION.

   WE TRULY HAVE A DUTY TOWARD THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND WE WILL GIVE
YOU ALL OUR SUPPORT.  WE ARE WILLING TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING THAT WE
CAN POSSIBLY GIVE YOU SO THAT [WORD INDISTINCT] CAN LIVE IN PEACE AND
TRANQUILLITY.

   ECHOING THAT ATTITUDE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE MUST ALSO HELP OUR
SOLDIERS.  WE MUST GIVE THEM ALL THE COOPERATION THEY NEED IN ORDER
FOR THE CURRENT SITUATION TO END AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  WE MUST CALL
FOR NATIONAL UNITY.  WE MUST ALL COOPERATE TO SAVE OUR HOMELAND FROM
THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION.  WE MUST ALL UNITE TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND
TRANQUILLITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, ALWAYS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE
SITUATION OUR COUNTRY IS GOING THROUGH.

   WE MUST SUPPORT OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, OUR INSTITUTIONS, AND WE
MUST TOTALLY REJECT THE FMLN TERRORIST FORCES.  WE MUST FACE THOSE
FORCES THROUGH A UNITED FRONT.  WE CALL ON ALL OF OUR COUNTRY'S
DEMOCRATIC AND POLITICAL FORCES TO FORM A UNITED FRONT; TO REJECT
VIOLENCE AS A WAY OF SOLVING PROBLEMS IN EL SALVADOR; AND TO UNITE IN
OUR ASPIRATION TO LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY AND IN PEACE, TRANQUILLITY, AND
RESPECT FOR THE LAWS.  BRIEFLY, WE MUST UNITE TO LIVE IN A DE JURE
STATE IN WHICH THE PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN HARMONY AND TRANQUILLITY.

   IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES JOIN EFFORTS,
NOT AROUND A GOVERNMENT OR AN INSTITUTION, BUT FOR THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR DEAREST GOALS.

   WE ARE RECEIVING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT.  THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS SUPPORTING SALVADORAN DEMOCRACY.  WE HAVE
RECEIVED ENCOURAGING MESSAGES FROM COUNTRIES SUCH AS GREAT BRITAIN,
WHICH HAS VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNED THE FMLN TERRORIST ACTION.  WE HAVE
RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE EEC, IN WHICH THAT GROUP IS TELLING THE
FMLN THAT THE ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS AND
THAT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS, WE MUST FIRST HAVE PEACE AND
THEN ACHIEVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THOSE
GOALS MUST BE ATTAINED THROUGH A PEACE PROCESS.  THE GOVERNMENT HAD
ALREADY BEGAN THAT PROCESS AND THE FMLN TRIED TO BREAK IT.  THE PEACE
PROCESS MUST BE BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENT AND ESPECIALLY ON
THE TELA AGREEMENT.

   WE HAVE ALSO WITNESSED HOW DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL
TENDENCIES HAVE BECOME UNIFIED IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  [CONTINUED]

   SANTIAGO, 14 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT] [HERNAN
BUCHI, IN PROGRESS] [TEXT] UNFORTUNATELY MARRED BY A CARABINERO'S
ASSASSINATION, WE HAVE RETURNED TO DEMOCRACY.  PATRICIO AYLWIN HAS
BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF CHILE. I CONGRATULATE HIM AND HIS FOLLOWERS,
AND I WISH HIM SUCCESS IN HIS GOVERNMENT, FOR THE GOOD OF CHILE AND
CHILEANS. HIS TRIUMPH IS NOT A DEFEAT FOR OUR IDEAS. MY CAMPAIGN WAS
CONSTANTLY FOCUSED ON THE IDEA OF FREEDOM -- BOTH POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC -- PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY.  IT HAD
TO BE THIS WAY BECAUSE THIS IS THE FUTURE CHILEANS WANT, AND IF OUR
IDEAS GAIN GROUND, THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NAME OF THE MAN
CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THEM.

   BUT THOSE IDEAS MUST BE DISSEMINATED EVEN MORE WITH INCESSANT WORK.
IN A DEMOCRACY, THE OPPOSITION ALSO GOVERNS.  HISTORY HAS PLACED US IN
THE CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS. WE WILL BE WILLING
TO COOPERATE FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, BUT WE WILL STAY ALERT TO
DEFEND OUR VISION OF THE FUTURE. I AM CONVINCED THAT AN INTELLIGENT
OPPOSITION CAN DO MUCH FOR THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY IF THAT
OPPOSITION IS BACKED BY THE NEARLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE WHO TODAY
SUPPORTED MY CANDIDACY.

   THE WORK THAT LIES AHEAD WILL TO A LARGE EXTENT BE CARRIED OUT IN
CONGRESS. THE INFORMATION NOW AVAILABLE SUGGESTS THAT THE PACT FOR
DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESS HAS GAINED A VALUABLE REPRESENTATION IN BOTH
HOUSES OF CONGRESS. LET MY CONGRATULATIONS GO TO THE FUTURE DEPUTIES
AND SENATORS OF DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESS. I SEIZE THIS OCCASION TO LET
THEM KNOW THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON MY SUPPORT.

   I AM SATISFIED WITH THE NUMBER OF VOTES I WON, CONSIDERING THE
UNFAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. I AM SATISFIED WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC AND
GENEROUS WORK CARRIED OUT BY MY ELECTORAL STAFF AND BY THE POLITICAL
PARTIES.  I THANK THEM FOR THEIR SUPPORT.  I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK
EACH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR ME. TO THE MILLIONS OF CHILEAN
MEN AND WOMEN WHO IN SUNSHINE OR RAIN THROUGHOUT CHILE FILLED UP
STADIUMS, PLAZAS, AND STREETS, CHANTING OUT SLOGANS FOR THE FUTURE; TO
THOSE WHO SAW THE STREET WITH THE SYMBOL OF THE STAR OF HOPE; TO THOSE
WHO PASTED MY PICTURE ON WALLS, WINDOWS, AND NOTEBOOKS; TO THOSE WHO
ENCOURAGED ME IN THIS TIRESOME BUT MOVING CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBRACE, A
HANDSHAKE, OR A SMILE; TO ALL THOSE I WANT TO EXPRESS MY DEEPEST
THANKS.  I WILL KEEP THEM IN MY HEART FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

   WHEN WE INITIATED THIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN -- AN HONOR THAT YOU
KNOW I NEVER SOUGHT -- I TOLD MY FOLLOWERS THAT JUST LIKE CLIMBING A
MOUNTAIN, THERE WERE MOMENTS OF ADVANCE, FATIGUE, AND FALLS, BUT I
TRUSTED THAT, MUSTERING ALL OUR ENERGY, WE WOULD OUTDO OURSELVES AND
REACH THE SUMMIT. I AM SATISFIED BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT EACH ONE OF
US, AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A POLITICAL FORCE, HAVE OUTDONE OURSELVES
AND CLIMBED A LON WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN, BATTLING FOR OUR IDEAS AND FOR
VOTES. WE DID NOT REACH THE SUMMIT, TRUE, BUT THIS MUST NOT DISMAY US.
TODAY WE ARE CLOSER TO THE SUMMIT THAN WHEN WE STARTED.  THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, EVERYONE. GOOD NIGHT.

HAVE DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY RELEASE MRS PATRICIA ECHAVARRIA AND HER
DAUGHTER AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE AS

RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE CASES OF KIDNAPPED PEOPLE OF WHICH WE ARE
ACCUSED.

   8.  WE OFFER OUR SERVICES AS MEDIATORS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITH THE
EMERALD TRAFFICKERS, THE SO-CALLED PARAMILITARY GROUPS, AND THE
SO-CALLED HIRED ASSASSINS WITH THE ONLY PURPOSE OF ENDING THE VIOLENCE
THAT IS HURTING OUR COLOMBIAN FATHERLAND.

   9.  WE HAVE DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE SHIPMENT OF DRUGS AND TO TURN IN
OUR WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, LABORATORIES, CLANDESTINE LANDING STRIPS, AND
OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO OUR ACTIVITIES AS SOON AS WE GET
CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL GUARANTEES.

   10.  THERE WILL BE NO MORE BOMBINGS ANYWHERE ON NATIONAL TERRITORY
AND WE HAVE ORDERED THE SUSPENSION OF ALL TYPES OF EXECUTIONS OF
POLITICAL LEADERS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ASSOCIATION LEADERS, JUDICIAL
OFFICIALS, JOURNALISTS, POLICEMEN, AND SOLDIERS.

   11.  THE ESSENTIAL REASON FOR OUR STRUGGLE HAS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS
BE OUR FAMILIES, OUR FREEDOM, OUR PEOPLE, OUR LIVES, AND OUR RIGHTS AS
CITIZENS OF THIS FATHERLAND.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT BY
SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS LOPEZ]
[TEXT] BRAVE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ON THIS OCCASION AND AS DEFENSE AND
PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTER, PROFESSIONAL SOLDIER, AND A SALVADORAN
CITIZEN, I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO BRING YOU THIS MESSAGE.
ABOVE ALL, THIS MESSAGE CONVEYS OUR MOST RESPECTFUL AND THOUGHFUL
GREETINGS TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND OUR HOPES THAT, DURING THIS
TROUBLED TIME, YOU WILL REMAIN CALM AND HAVE CONFIDENCE AND FAITH IN
YOUR ARMED FORCES.

   A FEW MOMENTS AGO, YOU HEARD THE VOICE OF THE FIRST SOLDIER OF OUR
GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES, THE VOICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND
GENERAL COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES.  AT THIS TIME, I WISH TO
EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES, OF
THE INSTITUTION THAT AT THIS MOMENT IS BEING INSTITUTIONALLY
CHALLENGED.  WE, AS SOLDIERS BORN OF THIS PEOPLE TO SERVE THIS PEOPLE,
EXPRESS OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THAT MESSAGE OF CONFIDENCE, SECURITY, AND
HOPE SENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC.

   EVERYONE HAS HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY IN THE
PAST 48 HOURS.  NO CONSCIENTIOUS CITIZEN, NO REAL SALVADORAN, IS
UNAWARE OF THE AGGRESSION TO WHICH WE HAVE ONCE AGAIN BEEN SUBJECTED
BY THE F M L N'S [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FORCES]
TREACHEROUS TERRORIST FORCES.  EVIDENTLY, THIS ACTION, THIS
TERRORORIST ACTION, IS ONLY AIMED AT CAUSING PAIN AND SORROW FOR THE
PEOPLE AND AT DESTROYING THE REAL FEELINGS, INSPIRATION, AND WILL OF
THE PEOPLE.  ON THIS OCCASION, THE ARMED FORCES STEP FORWARD TO DEFEND
THE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEMANDING THE OBLITERATION OF THESE
TERRORIST AND COWARDLY FORCES.

   THE ATTITUDE OF OUR COURAGEOUS PEOPLE, THE ATTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE
WHO TODAY ARE WRITING ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT PAGES IN OUR HISTORY,
CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ARMED FORCES, GUARANTOR OF SECURITY,
ORDER, AND TRANQUILITY, TO SAY: SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE ARMED FORCES
ARE WITH YOU; THE ARMED FORCES ASSUME THEIR PROFESSIONAL DUTY OF
DEFENDING THE MOST SACRED INTERESTS OF OUR HOMELAND, OF OUR COUNTRY,
EL SALVADOR.

   THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, AS AN INSTITUTION, HAVE NEVER
FORGOTTEN THEIR DUTY AND TODAY REITERATE THEIR ABSOLUTE WILLINGNESS
AND DETERMINATION TO MAKE THE BIGGEST SACRIFICE IF THIS BECOMES
NECESSARY, SO THAT YOU, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, CAN ASPIRE TO A FUTURE FULL
OF HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING.

   WE PRAISE THE DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLE.  WE APPLAUD AND
CONGRATULATE THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR DETERMINATION AND THE STOICISM WITH
WHICH THEY, THE BRAVE SALVADORAN CITIZENS, HAVE CONFRONTED THESE
MOMENTS OF TRAGEDY AND CHALLENGE.

   WE SAY: SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THIS INSTITUTION -- YOUR ARMED FORCES --
IS AT YOUR SIDE.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO SHED THEIR BLOOD AND
GIVE THEIR LIVES PRECISELY SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR PEOPLE, SO THAT
THE CHILDREN OF OUR CHILDREN, CAN ASPIRE TO A WORTHY, FREE, JUST, AND
INDEPENDENT LIFE.

   WE WISH TO CONGRATULATE OUR PEOPLE FOR THEIR ATTITUDE.  WE WISH TO
CONGRATULATE ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BECAUSE, WITH THEIR WORDS OF
ENCOURAGEMENT SENT TO US THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS, THE INSTITUTION
FEELS STRONGER AND MORE WILLING TO DEFEND THE REAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THIS BRAVE ATTITUDE -- THIS ATTITUDE THAT REFLECTS THE REAL
SALVADORANS -- IS, WITHOUT DOUBT, THE STRONGEST RESPONSE AND THE WORST
PUNISHMENT THE TERRORIST FORCES COULD RECEIVE.  [CONTINUED]

ARTURO CASADIEGO TORRADO, SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE COLOMBIAN POLICE,
HAS REPORTED THE DEATH OF GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA.  [POLICE DIRECTOR]
GENERAL GOMEZ PADILLA, WHO IS IN CALI, WILL TRAVEL TO BOGOTA AND WILL
SOON HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON THE DEATH OF
THIS CRIMINAL.

   IN AN INTERVIEW, GEN CASADIEGO TORRADO INFORMED RCN OF THE
OPERATION MOUNTED IN THE AREA WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CASADIEGO] WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THOSE
OPERATING IN THAT AREA THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND THE PEOPLE
WITH THEM HAVE BEEN KILLED.

   THAT IS THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AVAILABLE.  WE DO NOT HAVE DETAILS
ON THE OPERATION YET.  IT WAS THE RESULT OF LONG-TERM INTELLIGENCE
WORK CARRIED OUT WITH GREAT PROFESSIONALISM, WHICH GAVE US INFORMATION
ON WHERE HE COULD BE FOUND.  WE DEPLOYED SPECIAL GROUPS TO CARRY OUT
THAT TASK.

   [REPORTER] GENERAL, EXACTLY WHERE DID THE OPERATION, IN WHICH
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND 15 OTHERS WERE KILLED, TAKE PLACE?

   [CASADIEGO] IN A RURAL AREA, AS YOU KNOW, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF
THE COUNTRY.  I DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT LOCATION.

   [REPORTER] HAS IT BEEN OFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND
HIS SON WERE KILLED?  IS THIS AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL
POLICE?

   [CASADIEGO] THAT IS THE INFORMATION I HAVE.  THAT IS THE
INFORMATION I HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT.

   [REPORTER] WHO ARE THE OTHER 15 PEOPLE KILLED?

   [CASADIEGO] WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THEM YET.  OFFICIALS ARE
TRAVELING TO THE SITE TO OFFICIALLY IDENTIFY THE BODIES.

   [REPORTER] WERE THEY ASSISTANTS, BODYGUARDS, ESCORTS?

   [CASADIEGO] YES, WE ARE SURE OF THAT.

   [REPORTER] HAVE WEAPONS OR OTHER ITEMS BEEN CONFISCATED?  WE HAVE
HEARD THAT IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS WERE FOUND.

   [CASADIEGO] YES, WE KNOW THAT WEAPONS WERE FOUND WHICH WERE USED TO
PROTECT THIS MAN.  HOWEVER, AS I SAID, WE DO NOT HAVE THE DETAILS ON
THE INCIDENT YET.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS SON
WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE WITH HIM.

   [REPORTER] WHO ELSE IS THERE?  IS THERE A COMMISSION OF JUDGES?  WE
UNDERSTAND THAT A FEW MOMENTS AGO A PLANE DEPARTED WITH
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE AND THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.

   [CASADIEGO] I DO NOT KNOW IF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE HAVE TRAVELED THERE.  WE SENT POLICE
INSPECTORS, JUDGES, AND WE KNOW THAT THE COMMANDERS OF THE THREE
NEIGHBORING DEPARTMENTS WILL ALSO BE THERE.

   [REPORTER] HOW WAS THE OPERATION PLANNED, AND HAS THE PRESIDENT
BEEN INFORMED?

   [CASADIEGO] AS I SAID, THIS OPERATION IS THE RESULT OF ARDUOUS WORK
BY THE NATIONAL POLICE.  IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION.  FOR A LONG
TIME WE HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT THESE TYPES OF OPERATIONS.  WE ARE
STILL DOING THIS TYPE OF WORK AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE FMLN
WILL MAINTAIN THESE UNILATERAL ACTIONS DURING A SUFFICIENT AND
MODERATE PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES
TO CARRY OUT THE CORRESPONDING ACTIONS THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO
CREATING A SERIOUS CLIMATE FOR NEGOTIATIONS.  IN THIS SENSE, WE DEMAND
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES TO:

   1.  IMMEDIATELY CEASE REPRESSION, STOP ASSASSINATIONS, ARRESTS, USE
OF TORTURE ON POLITICAL PRISONERS, SECURITY CORPS ACTIONS AGAINST
DEMONSTRATIONS, STRIKES, AND OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO DEMAND
THE LIFTING OF THE SIEGE AGAINST THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, LABOR UNION
OFFICES, AND OFFICES OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS, AND AN END TO
SEARCHES AGAINST THESE ORGANIZATIONS.

   2.  PERMIT THE IMMEDIATE REPATRIATION OF ALL REFUGEES, WITH NO
RESTRICTIONS, TO THE PLACES THEY SELECT.  TO LIFT THE SIEGE AND
RESTRICTIONS ON THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AT THE ALREADY ESTABLISHED
RESETTLEMENTS, AND ON THE CONFLICT AREAS WHERE THE ARMY PREVENTS THE
ARRIVAL OF SUPPLIES.

   3.  CEASE THE ATTACKS ON THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN THE FORM OF
ASSASSINATIONS, INTIMIDATION, AND DISMISSAL OF NEWSMEN, AND PRESSURE
ON THE MEDIA IN GENERAL.

   4.  SUSPEND CONSCRIPTION, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT ONLY AMONG THE LOW
INCOME SECTORS OF THE POPULATION.

   5.  STOP USING LAND MINES AND BOOBY TRAPS, WHICH HAVE CAUSED
HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES ATTRIBUTED TO THE FMLN.  STOP BOMBING CIVILIAN
TARGETS AND INHABITED AREAS.

   THE FMLN, IN TURN, AGREES TO STOP ACTIONS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE
GOVERNMENT'S WAR ECONOMY AND IMBALANCE THE ARMY'S DEFENSIVE SYSTEM.
THE FMLN AGREES TO STOP USING SUCH WEAPONS AS THE MINES THAT HAVE
INFLICTED THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY.  SOME OF THESE ACTIONS
HAVE AFFECTED THE POPULATION, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.  WE
DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT STOP USING REPRESSIVE MEASURES THAT
DIRECTLY AFFECT THE POPULATION AND THEIR DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS.  WE WILL
NOT, HOWEVER, ACCEPT AS A GOVERNMENT GOODWILL GESTURE OUR WAR DISABLED
LEAVING THE COUNTRY FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT, IF AND WHEN THIS DEPARTURE
TAKES PLACE.  WE REGARD THIS AS A BASIC HUMANITARIAN RIGHT SUBJECT TO
INTERNATIONAL ACCORDS, SUCH AS THE GENEVA CONVENTION, SIGNED AND
RATIFIED BY THE SALVADORAN STATE.  THE FULFILLMENT OF THESE ACCORDS
HAS BEEN DEMANDED FROM THE GOVERNMENT BY VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND THE
LATEST UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION RESOLUTION.

   AS OF TODAY, WE WILL BE WATCHING THE ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE ARMED FORCES ON THE FIVE POINTS PROPOSED.  WE INVITE THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES TO DEMONSTRATE TRUE WILLINGNESS FOR
PEACE BY TAKING THE ACTIONS WE HAVE PROPOSED AND INITIATING A SERIOUS
NEGOTIATING PROCESS TO END THE WAR.  

   FMLN GENERAL COMMAND.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 27 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE ATTACK IN WHICH
FIVE VENEZUELAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AT THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA HAS
BEEN BLAMED, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, ON COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND
DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA.

   VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ BLAMED COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKING GANGS FOR THE ATTACK -- IN WHICH FIVE GUARDS WERE KILLED
-- PERPETRATED ON 26 OCTOBER IN THE BORDER STATE OF APURE AGAINST A
NATIONAL GUARD PATROL IN THE AREA.

   REFERRING LAST NIGHT TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS, PEREZ SAID THIS
IS "A PROVOCATION FOR VENEZUELA BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO EXTEND
THEIR CLAWS TO OUR COUNTRY."

   HOWEVER, JORGE ROMERO, GOVERNOR OF THE BORDER STATE OF TACHIRA,
WHICH BORDERS THE STATE OF APURE, MAINTAINED THIS WAS AN "ATTACK WITH
VERY POWERFUL EXPLOSIVES" PERPETRATED BY "MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIAN
GUERRILLAS, PRESUMABLY FROM THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY,
AGAINST A NATIONAL GUARD JEEP."

   ACCORDING TO ROMERO, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED DURING THE PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE EXPLOSIVES THAT KILLED THE FIVE SOLDIERS WERE
BURIED IN A ROAD NEAR CUTUFI, AND SET OFF BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE
MILITARY VEHICLE PASSED BY.

   LAST NIGHT, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY ORDERED THE ARREST OF FIVE ALLEGED
COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS, WHOM IT BLAMED FOR THE ATTACK.  HOWEVER, THE
ATTACKERS REPORTEDLY CROSSED THE BORDER INTO COLOMBIA.

   SAN SALVADOR, 31 MAY 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES TODAY ANNOUNCED THE SEIZURE OF A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS
FROM THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS
AT A SAFE HOUSE IN THE NORTHERN SECTION OF THIS CAPITAL.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE ARSENAL IS THE LARGEST ONE SEIZED FROM
THE GUERRILLAS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

   A POLICE OFFICER STRESSED THAT THE WEAPONS -- 348 SOVIET-MADE AK-47
RIFLES, 118 AUTOMATIC PISTOLS, 29 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, APPROXIMATELY 159
AMMUNITION SACKS, SWORDS, FRAGMENTATION GRENADES, AND OVER
100 EXPLOSIVE BLOCKS WITH DETONATORS AND SLOW-BURNING FUSES -- WERE
AMONG THE SUPPLIES FOUND IN AN FMLN WAREHOUSE IN SAN SALVADOR.

   A OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE NOTED THAT "MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
HAVE LEARNED THAT TERRORIST GROUPS WERE SMUGGLING SOVIET-MADE WEAPONS
FROM NICARAGUA IN SPECIALLY-OUTFITTED TRAILERS TO EQUIP THE URBAN
COMMANDOS AS WELL AS THE MILITIAS TO ENABLE THEM TO COMMIT TERRORIST
ACTS ON 1 JUNE."

   SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI OF THE RIGHTIST
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE WILL ASSUME THIS COUNTRY'S PRESIDENCY
TOMORROW; THE ARMED FORCES HAVE DEPLOYED 10,000 TROOPS FOR THE
CEREMONY.

   BOGOTA, 27 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
REPORTER ON THE SCENE BY STUDIO REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER, IN
PROGRESS] ... IF THE COLLEAGUES AT THE CENTRAL STUDIO HAVE ANY
QUESTIONS FOR THE BOGOTA ELECTRICAL ENERGY INSTITUTE EMPLOYEE WHO WAS
AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT.  WE ARE OBSERVING A TERRIBLE SCENE OF
DESOLATION AND DEATH BECAUSE ALL THE PASSANGERS GOING TO CALI, VALLE
DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT, DIED.  THERE IS NO SINGLE SURVIVOR ACCORDING TO
NATIONAL POLICE REPORTS.  THEY ARE AWAITING CRIMINAL INSTRUCTION
JUDGES.  HOWEVER, THE ELECTRICITY COMPANY WORKER MAY ANSWER QUESTIONS
POSED BY STUDIO REPORTERS.  LATER ON WE WILL HAVE MORE OFFICIAL
INFORMATION.

   [STUDIO REPORTER] CAN YOU CONFIRM THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE'S BOMB
SQUAD?  AUTHORITIES FEAR THE CRASH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN
EXPLOSION RATHER THAN AN ACCIDENT INSIDE THE AIRPLANE.

   [REPORTER] THE F-2 JUDICIAL POLICE AND CRIMINAL STATISTICS EXPERTS
ARE HERE.  THEY FEEL THAT THE ACCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A
TERRORIST ACTION.  THE REMARK WAS MADE BASED ON WITNESS ACCOUNTS.
THEY NOTED THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A TERRORIST ATTACK BECAUSE
AIRPLANES DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF ACCIDENT UNLESS THERE IS AN
EXPLOSION, SOMETHING THAT HAS VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.  ACCORDING TO
REPORTS BY THE NATIONAL POLICE F-2 EXPERTS, THE AIRPLANE BROKE INTO
SIX PIECES.  IT IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, WHICH IS WHY THE 106
PASSENGERS ABOARD ARE STREWN ACROSS AN AREA 6-8 KM WIDE.

   ACCESS TO THE AIRPLANE'S REMAINS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS IS A
MOUNTAINOUS REGION.  THE CASQUITO [WORD INDISTINCT] IS THROUGH THE
ROAD THAT GOES FROM BOSA, CUNDINAMARCA DEPARTMENT, TO THE SCHOOL [NOT
FURTHER IDENTIFIED].  AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS AREA IS LOCATED VERY
CLOSE TO SLUICE NUMBER 3, MUNA 3, WHICH FEEDS WATER TO THE DAM.  THE
SITUATION IS VERY DIFFICULT AND DRAMATIC.  RIGHT NOW, EXPERTS ARE
COLLECTING SAMPLES AND TRYING FIND ALL THEY CAN TO LEARN FOR SURE IF
THIS WAS A TERRORIST ACTION OR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT CAUSED BY A FLAW IN
THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF THE HK-1803 AIRPLANE.

AVELLO SILVA, ALSO KNOWN AS EL MONO AVELLO. THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED
THAT AVELLO IS WANTED BY A U.S.  COURT FOR COMMITING MANY CRIMES,
INCLUDING CONSPIRACY AND COMPLICITY IN CRIMES AGAINST THE U.S.
ECONOMY.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS REOPENED THE
PROCESS OF EXTRADITION VIA ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS AFTER THE LAW ON

EXPEL REYNOSA AGUILAR FROM COLOMBIA. HE IS WANTED BY TWO LIMA COURTS

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 APR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST KILLING OF
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO AND ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) OF THE CRIME.

   LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO VALDIVIESO AND VICE
PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO ALSO DECLARED THAT THE DEATH OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS CAUSED BY WHAT VALDIVIESO TERMED THE GUERRILLAS'
"IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE."

   GARCIA ALVARADO, 56, WAS KILLED WHEN A BOMB PLACED BY URBAN
GUERRILLAS ON HIS VEHICLE EXPLODED AS IT CAME TO A HALT AT AN
INTERSECTION IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR.

   "WE HAVE TO CONDEMN THIS INCIDENT, IT IS A GUERRILLA ACT," ALFREDO
CRISTIANI, NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) PRESIDENT-ELECT,
WHO WILL REPLACE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE ON 1 JUNE,
STATED.

   CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THESE ARE THE RISKS FACED BY SOMEONE WHO
ENFORCES THE LAW."  HE NOTED THAT "THE GUERRILLAS' IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE
MAKES IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THEY WANT PEACE."

   ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE BECAUSE ATTORNEY
GENERAL GARCIA ALVARADO WARNED THAT "HE WOULD TAKE MEASURES AGAINST
URBAN TERRORISTS."

   VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO SAID THAT WHEN THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL'S CAR STOPPED AT A LIGHT ON A STREET IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR,
AN INDIVIDUAL PLACED A BOMB ON THE ROOF OF THE ARMORED VEHICLE.

   "THE DRIVER TOLD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ABOUT THE BOMB.  THE VEHICLE
SWERVED AND THE BOMB EXPLODED, CAUSING THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE TO
COLLAPSE ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S HEAD," MERINO STATED.

   GUERRILLAS ATTACKED MERINO'S HOME IN SAN SALVADOR 5 DAYS AGO WITH
EXPLOSIVES.  THERE WERE SEVEN CHILDREN, INCLUDING FOUR OF THE VICE
PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN, IN THE HOME AT THE TIME.  A 15-YEAR-OLD NIECE OF
MERINO'S WAS INJURED.

   "THESE INCIDENTS," CRISTIANI SAID, "FRANKLY CAUSE US TO BECOME MORE
AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE MUST NOT PERMIT TERRORIST ACTIONS TO OCCUR
IN EL SALVADOR."

   THE PRESIDENT-ELECT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESE ATTACKS
"WILL PREVENT THE INAUGURAL CEREMONY FROM TAKING PLACE."

   "I AM CERTAIN THAT THE INAUGURATION WILL BE ON 1 JUNE.  WE WILL NOT
JUMP OVERBOARD OR MAKE A RUN FOR IT.  WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST
AND WILL GO ON," HE STATED.

   CRISTIANI SAID THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS ARE INTENDED TO PROMPT A
GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY REACTION SO THE FMLN CAN "EXPLOIT IT" ABROAD
TO "POLITICALLY ISOLATE THE NEW GOVERNMENT."

   RICARDO VALDIVIESO, PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSSEMBLY AND AN
ARENA LEADER, SAID THE FMLN AND ITS "FRONT" GROUPS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE "IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE THAT KILLED ATTORNEY GENERAL GARCIA."

   VALDIVIESO SAID THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WILL APPROVE DRASTIC LAWS
TO "HALT THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE."  HE SAID THE ATTORNEY GENERAL "WAS
APOLITICAL, WORKED FOR JUSTICE, AND DID NOT DESERVE TO DIE LIKE THAT."

   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE AND GARCIA ALVARADO'S DRIVER, WHO ESCAPED
UNSCATHED, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS TRAVELING WITH TWO BODYGUARDS.
ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED.

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S BODY WAS DESTROYED BY THE BOMB THAT EXPLODED
OVER HIS HEAD.

   NO GROUP HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE ATTACK YET, BUT POLICE SOURCES
CLAIM IT "IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FMLN URBAN COMMANDOS."

   THE SAME SOURCES CONFIRMED THAT GARCIA ALVARADO HAD BEEN THREATENED
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BY SALVADORAN URBAN GUERRILLAS.

   MOMENTS AFTER THE ATTACK, ARMY AND POLICE UNITS CORDONED OFF THE
AREA AND BEGAN AN ALL-OUT MILITARY OPERATION TO FIND THOSE
RESPONSIBLE.

   GARCIA ALVARADO, FATHER OF SIX, WAS APPOINTED ATTORNEY GENERAL ON
23 DECEMBER 1988.  HE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE CLOSELY LINKED TO ARENA.
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HOWEVER, HE SAID HE DID NOT REPRESENT ANY PARTY
AND WAS CARRYING OUT HIS JOB "IMPARTIALLY AND WITH THE INTENTION OF
ENFORCING THE COUNTRY'S LAWS."

   TEL AVIV (ISRAEL), 27 AUG 89 (IDF RADIO) -- [EXCERPTS] EDUCATION
MINISTER YITZHAQ NAVON TODAY DEMANDED IN THE CABINET SESSION THAT THE
GOVERNMENT RETURN ALL ISRAELIS WHO ILLEGALLY PROVIDE MILITARY TRAINING
ABROAD.  THE GOVERNMENT MUST PUT AN END TO THE DISGRACE SOME ISRAELIS
CAUSE TO ALL OF US.  HERE IS A REPORT BY OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT
NATAN GUTMAN:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] THE WEEKLY CABINET SESSION DEALT WITH THE
COLOMBIA ISSUE ONLY BRIEFLY.  DEFENSE MINISTER YITZHAQ RABIN BRIEFLY
REFERRED TO THE ISSUE MAINLY BECAUSE HE WAS ASKED BY OTHER MINISTERS
TO DO SO.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER YITZHAQ NAVON SAID THAT THE
GOVERNMENT MUST PUT AN END TO THE DISGRACE CAUSED BY SOME ISRAELIS.
DEFENSE MINISTER RABIN MERELY STATED THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE
INVOLVEMENT OF ISRAELIS IN COLOMBIA IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.  DEFENSE
ELEMENTS MADE CLEAR AT THE MEETING THAT SINCE 1986 THERE HAS BEEN A
NEED TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC PERMIT FOR ANY SECURITY ACTIVITY BY AN
ISRAELI BODY ABROAD.  IT WAS FURTHER MADE CLEAR THAT THE HOD HAHANIT
[SPEARHEAD] COMPANY DID NOT HAVE SUCH A PERMIT, AND HAS BEEN WARNED
NOT TO OPERATE IN COLOMBIA.

   AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SESSION, CABINET SECRETARY ELYAQIM
RUBINSTEIN SAID THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DISASSOCIATES ITSELF FROM
ANY SUCH ACTIVITY.  IT WAS FURTHER STRESSED THAT ISRAEL CONSIDERS THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE PLAGUE OF INTERNATIONAL DRUGS A VERY IMPORTANT
QUEST.

   AS FOR THE SITUATION IN THE TERRITORIES, THE DEFENSE MINISTER
EXPLAINED THAT THE FEELING OF A DEADLOCKED POLITICAL PROCESS LEADS TO
AN ESCALATION OF THE INTIFADAH [UPRISING].  IT WAS STRESSED THAT THE
MASKED MEN CREATE A REAL LEGAL PROBLEM.  MINISTER SCIAKI SUGGESTED
THAT ORDERS BE ISSUED TO ALLOW SHOOTING AT MASKED MEN IF SUSPICIONS
WARRANT.  [END RECORDING]

   FINANCE MINISTER SHIM'ON PERES' DRAFT LAW ON STREAMLINING
BUREAUCRACY WAS APPROVED TODAY IN THE CABINET BY A LARGE MAJORITY OF
14 TO 2.  SHARP EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE FINANCE MINISTER AND SOME LIKUD
MINISTERS TOOK PLACE.  OUR ECONOMIC CORRESPONDENT YARON KULAS REPORTS:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [KULAS] THE DEBATE ON THE DRAFT LAW ON SLASHING
BUREAUCRACY REOPENED THE LOUD DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FINANCE
MINISTER AND LIKUD MINISTERS MOSHE NISIM, RONI MILO, AND EHUD OLMERT.
ONLY TWO MINISTERS OBJECTED TO THE PROPOSAL: 'EZER WEIZMAN, WHO SAID
THAT THE TRUE ECONOMIC PROBLEM TODAY IS THE INTIFADAH; AND ECOLOGY AND
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MINISTER RONI MILO.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 15 JUL 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT
CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ' BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS KIDNAPPED IN COLOMBIA,
ACCORDING TO FAMILY SOURCES IN CARACAS.  A REPORT BROADCAST ON A
PRIVATE TELEVISION CHANNEL STATED THAT UNIDENTIFIED ASSAILANTS
KIDNAPPED NORBERTO RODRIGUEZ -- BROTHER OF VENEZUELA'S FIRST LADY
BLANCA RODRIGUEZ DE PEREZ -- IN COLOMBIA'S NORTHERN SANTANDER
DEPARTMENT, WHERE HE WAS TENDING TO PERSONAL MATTERS.

   ACCORDING TO THE TELEVISION REPORT, THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT
CONTACTED COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ON THE
INCIDENT.  NO REASONS WERE GIVEN AS TO WHY RODRIGUEZ' RELATIVES FEAR
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THE RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY [UCA], FATHER MIGUEL FRANCISCO ESTRADA, HAS DESCRIBED THE
GOVERNMENT'S REPORT THAT ARMED FORCES ELEMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
KILLING OF SIX UCA PRIESTS AS MOST IMPORTANT, ALTHOUGH HE ALSO NOTED
THAT THE REPORT IS INCOMPLETE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ESTRADA] I BELIEVE IT IS INCOMPLETE BECAUSE WE
DO NOT YET KNOW WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES.  WE ONLY KNOW THAT THEY
BELONG TO AN INSTITUTION, AND THIS OF COURSE IS ONLY PARTIAL
INFORMATION.

   [REPORTER] DID YOU KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO MAKE THIS
ANNOUNCEMENT LAST NIGHT, OR WAS IT A SURPRISE?

   [ESTRADA] I THINK IT WAS A SURPRISE BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN IN TOUCH
WITH THE PRESIDENT AND WITH THE CRIME COMMISSION, WHICH IS THE ONE
CARRYING OUT THE INVESTIGATIONS ON ORDERS FROM THE PRESIDENT AND THE
GOVERNMENT.  THEY PROMISED US THAT IF WE WERE TO COOPERATE BY
PROVIDING INFORMATION, THEY WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE
THE PROBLEM AND CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   AT THAT POINT I WAS SKEPTICAL, BECAUSE THE PERSONS WHO HAVE
TESTIFIED HAVE ACCUSED THE ARMED FORCES, AND I HAD NEVER SEEN A
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT OR THE ARMED FORCES MAKING A SERIOUS EFFORT TO
CLEAN UP ITS IMAGE AND CARRY OUT INVESTIGTIONS TO PUT MEMBERS OF THE
ARMED FORCES IN PRISON.  I WAS SKEPTICAL.  I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT
HAPPEN, BUT FACTS SHOW THAT I WAS MISTAKEN. [END RECORDING]

   FATHER ESTRADA HAS ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN INTERNATIONAL
PRESSURE TO HAVE THIS CASE INVESTIGATED, BUT HE OPTIMISTICALLY
BELIEVES THAT THE DECISION TO INVESTIGATE HAS BEEN ADOPTED ALSO FOR
THE SAKE OF THE PRESTIGE OF THE ARMED FORCES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ESTRADA] I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED
FORCES ARE ACTING NOT ONLY AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE, BUT ALSO BECAUSE
THEY COULD BE DENIED MILITARY OR ECONOMIC AID.  I BELIEVE THAT A CRIME
SUCH AS THE ONE BEING INVESTIGATED GOES AGAINST THE VERY ESSENCE OF
THE ARMED FORCES, WHICH EXISTS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS, NOT TO HARM
THEM. [END RECORDING]

   FATHER ESTRADA SAID HE TRUSTS IN THE MORAL STRENGTH OF PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI TO SEE THIS CASE THROUGH TO THE END.  HE CAUTIONED, HOWEVER,
THAT SO FAR NOTHING NEW HAS BEEN SAID AND THAT A LISTING OF THE PEOPLE
INVOLVED AND A JUST SENTENCE WOULD BE NEWS.

   LIMA, 5 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] IN LIMA TODAY, UNOFFICIAL SOURCES
REPORTED THAT AT LEAST 2,500 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DETAINED BY THE PERUVIAN
POLICE IN RAIDS CARRIED OUT IN SEARCH OF HECTOR DELGADO PARKER, A
LOCAL TELEVISION IMPRESARIO, AND HIS KIDNAPPERS.

   THE POLICE RAIDS BEGAN SHORTLY AFTER THE KIDNAPPING OF DELGADO
PARKER, A FORMER ADVISER TO PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND ONE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT TELEVISION IMPRESARIO.  DELGADO PARKER WAS
KIDNAPPED IN DOWNTOWN LIMA WEDNESDAY [4 OCTOBER] BY A COMMANDO OF THE
PRO-CHE GUEVARA GROUP TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA).

   AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ACTION, DELGADO'S DRIVER WAS KILLED,
AND DELGADO'S BODYGUARD WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED, WHILE DELGADO HIMSELF
WAS VIOLENTLY ABDUCTED BY THE MRTA ACTIVISTS.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES, THE RAIDS CARRIED OUT BY THE POLICE, WHO
DETAIN PEOPLE WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION PAPERS AND SUSPECTS AFTER
CHECKING ON PEDESTRIANS AND VEHICLES, TOOK PLACE ON LIMA'S ACCESS
ROADS AS WELL AS IN SOME SUBURBAN AREAS OF THIS CITY AND EVEN IN
DOWNTOWN LIMA.

   THE PERUVIAN NATIONAL POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT SOME 2,000 AGENTS
OF THE ANTITERRORIST DIRECTORATE (DIRCOTE) AND THE KIDNAPPING DIVISION
ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE SEARCH OPERATIONS ORDERED BY PRESIDENT
GARCIA.

CASANOVA HAS VISITED LA ALAMEDA ROOSEVELT TO OBSERVE THE VOTING
PROCESS.  HE ALSO SAID AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE CONDUCTED INTO THE
MURDERS OF THREE REPORTERS, TWO SALVADORANS AND A NETHERLANDER.  THERE
WILL ALSO BE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE WOUNDING OF A SALVADORAN
REPORTER AND A CBS REPORTER.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VIDES] THIS IS THE SAME QUESTION ASKED [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  THE ELECTION PROCESS IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY IN ALL
MUNICIPALITIES EXCEPT SEVEN.  CLASHES WERE REPORTED IN TWO
MUNICIPALITIES AND THE ELECTIONS WERE SUSPENDED IN TWO OTHERS.  ONE OF
THEM IS EL SAUCE, WITH WHICH COMMUNICATIONS HAVE BEEN CUT OFF.  THE
OTHER IS SANTA ELENA, WHERE A CLASH OCCURRED.  I THINK PEOPLE WILL
VOTE HERE LATER.  NO VOTING IS TAKING PLACE IN FOUR OTHER
MUNICIPALITIES.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [VIDES] I HAVE NO OTHER INFORMATION.  AT THE TIME I DEPARTED, I
SENT FOR REPORTS FROM THE HOSPITAL.  I WAS TOLD HE DIED, BUT WE HAVE
TO GATHER MORE DATA ON HOW THE INCIDENT HAPPENED.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [VIDES] WE HAVE ALWAYS HELD REPORTERS IN THE HIGHEST REGARD.  ALL
ARMED FORCES MEMBERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THIS.  BUT PROBLEMS ARISE
WHEN SOME PEOPLE IGNORE CHECKPOINTS AND THE GUARDS TRY TO STOP THEM.
I HEREBY APPEAL TO PEOPLE TO OBEY CHECKPOINTS.  WE ARE THE FIRST TO
REGRET THESE INCIDENTS.  WE HAVE VERY GOOD AND CLOSE RELATIONS WITH
THE MEDIA AND KNOW [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WILL THIS HAVE REPERCUSSIONS?

   [VIDES] SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS WILL CERTAINLY OCCUR, BUT YOU CAN
REST ASSURED THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS UNINTENTIONAL.  SOME PEOPLE
IGNORED THE ORDER TO STOP.  THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE MORE ALERT AND AWARE
OF THE SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE REBELS' ATTACKS.  [END RECORDING]

[TEXT] [CONTINUED] A.  WE HEREBY VOICE OUR WILLINGNESS THAT THERE BE
AN IMMEDIATE IN SITU CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION AND AN
OVERALL AND DEFINITIVE SIMULTANEOUS NEGOTIATION LEADING TO A NATIONAL
CONSENSUS BASED ON DEMOCRATIZATION, DEMILITARIZATION OF SOCIETY, AND
RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS OF SALVADORANS.

   B.  IN ORDER TO HOLD GOOD NEGOTIATIONS, WE FEEL IT IS NECESSARY TO
ESTABLISH IMMEDIATE GUARANTEES FOR THE RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS,
DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS, AND POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS THROUGH:

      1.  LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE AND REPEAL OF THE LAW ON REFO
THE PENAL CODES, ALSO KNOWN AS THE ANTITERRORIST LAW THAT WAS RECENTLY
APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.

      2.  RELEASE OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS.

      3.  ALLOWED DEPARTURE OF FMLN WAR DISABLED AND MEDICAL TREATMEN
FMLN WOUNDED.

      4.  IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL OF THE FOLLOWING COMMANDERS AND OFFICER
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF, FOR
HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN DECISIONS MADE BY THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND
TO CARRY OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION
AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS; GENERAL RAFAEL
BUSTILLOS, GENERAL RAFAEL ANTONIO VILLAMARIONA, AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ VARELA, COMMANDER AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE
AIR FORCE, FOR THEIR DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY IN THE BOMBINGS OF THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION; COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA, DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER,
FOR HAVING SIGNED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS;
COLONEL HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE TREASURY POLICE, WHICH IS
THE CORPS THAT CARRIED OUT THE MURDERS; AND CAPTAIN ALFONSO CHAVEZ
GARCIA, WHO WAS THE DIRECT PERPETRATOR OF THESE MURDERS.  ALL OF THESE
DISMISSALS ARE NEEDED FOR THE CREDIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE
DECISION TO ESTABLISH GUARANTEES FOR THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND
AS A FIRST STEP IN THE PURGE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH IS
NECESSARY FOR THE DISMANTLING OF THE BLOODY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP OF
THE PAST 60 YEARS.

      5.  THE IN SITU VERIFICATION OF THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY THE INTER-AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND
THE UN WORK TEAM ON THE FORCED DISAPPEARANCES.

   C.  WE THINK IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO REORGANIZE THE NEGOTIATING
TABLE TO ENSURE THAT OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL GROUPS
ARE ABLE TO FULLY PARTICIPATE ALONG WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN.
THIS WILL ASSURE A NATIONAL CONSENSUS SOLUTION.

   MESSRS PRESIDENTS: THE SCOPE OF WAR IN OUR COUNTRY DEMANDS
REALISTIC VIEWPOINTS, VIABLE AND URGENT SOLUTIONS.  YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE
SO THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL PREVAIL OVER WAR AND THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS WILL YIELD SPECIFIC RESULTS.

   WE REITERATE OUR APPRECIATION TO YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS,

   THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, EL SALVADOR, 8 DECEMBER 1989.

THREE TERRORIST ATTACKS HERE IN BOGOTA AND IN THE CARIBBEAN PORT OF
CARTAGENA LEFT TWO DEAD AND THREE INJURED.

   THE MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT TOOK PLACE AT THE HISTORICAL BEACH RESORT
WHERE A BOMB EXPLODED ON THE 6TH FLOOR OF THE HILTON HOTEL KILLING TWO
PEOPLE AND SERIOUSLY INJURING ANOTHER.

   ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF A BANK IN

WERE DAMAGED BY THE BLAST.

   ACCORDING TO A GUARD AT THE COMPANY, WHO ESCAPED UNHURT, TWO
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PASSING BY THE BUILDING PLACED THE EXPLOSIVES AND
FLED.  THE GUARD SAID HE BARELY HAD TIME TO GET AWAY FROM THE BOMB
BEFORE IT WENT OFF.

   GUESTS AT THE HOTEL, WHERE PRACTICALLY ALL THE WINDOWS WERE
DESTROYED, HAD TO BE EVACUATED TO OTHER LODGINGS.

CARABINEROS MEMBERS WILL PARTICIPATE IN A SPECIAL POLICE PLAN BEFORE,
DURING, AND AFTER THE OFFICIAL TRANSFER OF POWER CEREMONIES IN OUR
COUNTRY.  THIS WAS REPORTED BY GENERAL ALFREDO NUNEZ ALLENDE, THE
CARABINEROS ORDER AND SECURITY DIRECTOR, WHO ALSO DESCRIBED THE LATEST
TERRORIST ATTACKS AS ISOLATED EVENTS WHICH ARE UNDER CONTROL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [NUNEZ ALLENDE] WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
SECURITY OF THE POPULATION AND OF THE FOREIGN GUESTS IN KEEPING WITH
OUR DUTY REQUIREMENTS.  AS FOR THE RECENT ATTACKS, I MUST SAY THEY ARE
REGRETTABLE AND I WISH THEY HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE, HOWEVER, THIS KIND OF
ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN ALL OUR PLANS.  WE HAVE
ADOPTED ALL THE MEASURES WE THINK ARE APPROPRIATE IN CASE THIS KIND OF
ACTIVITY TAKES PLACE.  WE WILL ALSO TRY TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF ACTION
DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION SO THAT PEOPLE UNDER OUR
PROTECTION WILL NOT BE AFFECTED.

   [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] WHY HAS TERRORIST ACTIVITY INCREASED IN THE
PAST FEW DAYS?

   [NUNEZ ALLENDE] I THINK THAT THIS IS NORMAL WITHIN THE CURRENT
PROCESS, IT IS NOT A SPECIFIC FACTOR OR OBJECTIVE.  THE ATTACKS ARE IN
KEEPING WITH WHAT WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  [END
RECORDING]

   THE CARABINEROS ORDER AND SECURITY CHIEF ALSO REPORTED THAT
REINFORCEMENTS WILL BE BROUGHT IN TO SANTIAGO FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY, AND HE ADDED THAT THE DISSOLUTION OF THE NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE CENTER WILL NOT AFFECT THE NORMAL WORK OF THE
CARABINEROS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT IN FACE OF THE RECENT TERRORIST
ATTACKS, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED.  AS FAR AS HE
KNEW, HE SAID, THE ARMY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN ESTABLISHING ORDER AND
SECURITY DURING THE TRANSFER OF POWER CEREMONY; THIS WILL BE EXCLUSIVE
RESPONSIBILITY OF CHILEAN CARABINEROS.

   AS FOR THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS, HE SAID THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
THAT THEY ARE PART OF A PLAN, ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT EXTREMIST
ACTIVITY HAS INCREASED LATELY.  HOWEVER, SUCH ACTIONS ARE WITHIN WHAT
WAS EXPECTED.  HE SAID THAT THE SECURITY PERSONNEL THAT WILL BE
BROUGHT IN BY THE FOREIGN GUESTS HAVE ALREADY COORDINATED THEIR
ACTIONS WITH THOSE OF CARABINEROS.

   ON 5 MARCH, THE CARABINEROS WILL ANNOUNCE A DETAILED REPORT ON THE
TRANSFER OF POWER CEREMONY AND ON THE MEASURES THAT WILL BE ADOPTED,
ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE CIRCULATION OF CARS.  THE SECURITY PLAN WILL
BE SIMILAR TO THE ONE USED DURING POPE JOHN PAUL II'S VISIT TO CHILE.

GUARDS AT A POWER SUBSTATION LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR.

   SEVERAL URBAN GUERRILLAS OPENED FIRED ON MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL
POLICE WHO WERE GUARDING A LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE
COMMISSION (CEL) SUBSTATION THAT WAS DAMAGED DURING THE ATTACK.

   THE WOUNDED POLICEMAN WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN TO THE MILITARY
HOSPITAL IN SAN SALVADOR.

   THE ATTACK OCCURRED AT 1130 (1730 GMT)--LESS THAN 3 HOURS BEFORE A
DEMONSTRATION THROUGH THE MAIN STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR BEGAN.  THE
DEMONSTRATORS ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF THE 10 UNION LEADERS WHO WERE
KILLED ON 31 OCTOBER DURING AN ATTACK ON A UNION HEADQUARTERS.

   THE POLICE STEPPED UP SURVEILLANCE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR TO
PREVENT NEW ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

   ON 1 NOVEMBER URBAN GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE 1ST
INFANTRY BRIGADE WITH ROCKETS.  DURING THE ATTACK, ONE PERSON WAS
KILLED AND ANOTHER WOUNDED.

   BOGOTA, 11 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA
DE GREIFF BRIEFED PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TODAY ON HER OFFICIAL VISIT
TO THE UNITED STATES TO ASK FOR HELP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.

   THE 32-YEAR-OLD COLOMBIAN MINISTER RETURNED LAST NIGHT ABOARD A
COMMERCIAL FLIGHT FROM WASHINGTON, WHERE SHE HAD TRAVELED ON 25 AUGUST
WITH HER FAMILY AMID STRONG RUMORS THAT SHE WOULD NOT RETURN TO
COLOMBIA AND THAT SHE WOULD RESIGN FROM THE POST SHE HAS HELD SINCE 16
JULY.

   JUSTICE MINISTRY SOURCES SAID TODAY THAT DE GREIFF "IS MAINTAINING
HER HEAVY AGENDA" AND ADDED THAT "NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT HER
LEAVING THE COUNTRY SOON."

   THE RUMORS ABOUT HER IMMINENT RESIGNATION BECAUSE OF THE THREATS
AGAINST HER AND HER FAMILY, INCLUDING HER 3-YEAR-OLD SON, MIGUEL JOSE,
HAVE STOPPED WITH HER RETURN TO BOGOTA.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, MONICA DE GREIFF'S VISIT TO
WASHINGTON WAS TO EXPLAIN "THE DIFFICULT SITUATION IN WHICH THE
COLOMBIAN JUDICIAL BRANCH CARRIES OUT ITS DANGEROUS JOB."

   PART OF THE $65 MILLION IN AID THE UNITED STATES HAS PROMISED TO
COLOMBIA TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS ALREADY ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY.
IT INCLUDES BULLETPROOF VESTS, ARMORED AUTOMOBILES, AND COMMUNICATION
EQUIPMENT FOR JUDGES AND OFFICIALS OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.

   THE COLOMBIAN JUSTICE MINISTER, WHO STUDIED LAW AT BOGOTA'S
UNIVERSITY OF EL ROSARIO AND IN THE UNITED STATES, WILL MEET WITH THE
PRESS TOMORROW AFTER HAVING PRESENTED HER REPORT ON HER TRIP.

   SO FAR THIS YEAR THREE JUDGES WHO WERE IN CHARGE OF CASES AGAINST
DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BEEN KILLED.  IN THIS DECADE, 200 PEOPLE,
INCLUDING JUDGES AND ATTORNEYS, HAVE BEEN KILLED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   LA PAZ, 1 AUG 89 (PRESENCIA) -- [EXCERPT] CONDEMNING THE SMEAR
CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIS COUNTRY, CUBAN AMBASSADOR TO BOLIVIA ANGEL
BRUGUES HAS STRONGLY REJECTED THE ACCUSATIONS MADE IN WASHINGTON BY
FLORENTINO ASPILLAGA, A FORMER CUBAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, DESCRIBING
HIM AS A "TRAITOR TO THE FATHERLAND, A DESERTER, AND AN IMMORAL
PERSON."

   CLAIMING THAT ASPILLAGA WAS INVOLVED WITH THE "GROUPS OF CRIMINALS
WHO WERE RECENTLY DISCOVERED IN THE CUBAN INTERIOR MINISTRY," BRUGUES
SAID THAT "ONE CANNOT BELIEVE IN THIS KIND OF INDIVIDUAL." BRUGUES
THUS ANSWERED THE REMARKS MADE BY ASPILLAGA, WHO SAID THAT, IN 1976,
CUBAN PRIME MINISTER FIDEL CASTRO ORDERED THE KILLING OF BOLIVIAN
GENERAL JOAQUIN ZENTENO ANAYA.

   IN A STATEMENT RELEASED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR
REGRETTED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS PROVIDING SHELTER FOR THIS KIND OF
PERSON AND USING THEM AS "PARROTS TO SMEAR THE CUBA REVOLUTION."

   THE NEWS AGENCY PRENSA LATINA ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE IN A
JOURNALISTIC DISPATCH. IT REPORTS THAT AMBASSADOR BRUGUES HAD POINTED
OUT THAT "THE U.S.  PHILOSOPHERS AND THEORETICIANS WHO TRIED TO THROW
SOCIALISM INTO THE GARBAGE CAN OF HISTORY HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW ATTACK
AGAINST CUBA."

   THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR ADDED: "THEY INTEND TO BRING INTERNATIONAL
DISCREDIT UPON CUBA AND POISON CUBA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FRATERNAL
BOLIVIAN NATION, A RELATIONSHIP MARKED BY FRIENDSHIP AND MUTUAL
RESPECT. TO THIS EFFECT, THEY AGAIN RESORT TO USING HYPOCRITS LIKE THE
DESERTER IN QUESTION."

   BRUGUES ADDED: "ON PRINCIPLE, CUBA HAS NOT RESORTED, AND WILL NOT
RESORT, TO TERRORIST METHODS LIKE THOSE USED BY THE UNITED STATES
AGAINST CUBAN LEADERS, AS STATED IN THE RECORDS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS."

   HE ADDED: "WE REITERATE TO GEN ZENTENO ANAYA'S WIDOW AND CHILDREN,
AND TO THE BOLIVIAN MILITARY MEN WHO, COMPLYING WITH THEIR MISSION,
CONFRONTED "CHE" [GUEVARA], THAT CUBA DOES NOT HARBOR ANY RANCOUR OR
HATRED.  CUBA HAS NEVER ACTED, AND WILL NEVER ACT, MOTIVATED BY BASE
REVENGEFUL FEELINGS."

   IN CONCLUSION, AMBASSADOR BRUGUES EXPRESSED HIS CONVICTION THAT THE
BOLIVIAN-CUBAN TIES WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS SMEAR CAMPAIGN.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 MAR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE TONIGHT CALLED FOR SPAIN, MEXICO, VENEZUELA, AND
NICARAGUA TO MEDIATE WITH THE SALVADORAN REBELS SO THEY WILL NOT
BOYCOTT THE 19 MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   "THERE CAN BE NO PEACE WITHOUT DEMOCRACY, AND VOTING IS THE PATH TO
DEMOCRACY," DUARTE SAID IN A SPEECH TRANSMITTED BY A NATIONWIDE RADIO
NETWORK.  IN THIS SPEECH, HE URGED THE GUERRILLAS TO LAY DOWN THEIR
WEAPONS AND JOIN THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS.

   DUARTE ISSUED THIS CALL TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE FOUR COUNTRIES
AND TO POPE JOHN PAUL II TO INTERCEDE WITH THE FMLN IN SUPPORT OF THE
ELECTIONS.

   IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, THE REBELS HAVE CALLED FOR A TRANSPORTATION
STOPPAGE TO BEGIN ON 16 MARCH, HAVE ORDERED GAS STATION OWNERS TO
REFRAIN FROM SELLING FUEL, HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL DESTROY POWER
LINES, AND THREATENED TO KILL ELECTION OFFICIALS.

   ON SUNDAY, 19 MARCH, 1.8 MILLION SALVADORANS WILL CAST THEIR VOTE
TO ELECT THE MAN WHO WILL REPLACE DUARTE.

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT CALLED ON THE PEOPLE TO VOTE AND SAID THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY "WILL GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THE ELECTIONS."

   FOLLOWING THE FAILURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, DURING WHICH THE REBELS
PROPOSED THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE CREATION OF "A NEW
ELECTORAL FRAMEWORK," THE FMLN HAS ASKED THE PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE OR TO
"VOID" THEIR BALLOTS.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 19 AUG 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] FIRE DEPARTMENT
SOURCES REPORTED TODAY THAT GUATEMALAN ARMY TROOPS KILLED NINE
PEASANTS BY MISTAKE ON 17 AUGUST.  THE SOLDIERS MISTOOK THE PEASANTS,
WHO WERE CIVIL SELF-DEFENSE PATROL (PAC) MEMBERS, WITH A REBEL COLUMN.

   ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCE, MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE STATED THAT
THE INCIDENT, WHERE THREE PEASANTS WERE ALSO WOUNDED, HAD BEEN A
"TRAGIC MISTAKE."

   THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHEN NORTHEASTERN COBAN BASE TROOPS MISTOOK
THE CIVILIAN PATROL FOR A REBEL COLUMN AND ATTACKED IT.  THE ATTACK
RESULTED IN 9 INDIAN PEASANTS KILLED AND 3 WOUNDED, INCLUDING A
17-YEAR-OLD.

   ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COBAN FIRE DEPARTMENT,
THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHEN A PAC PATROL WAS COMBING THE AREA FOR A
REBEL COLUMN THAT HAD BEEN SEEN IN "LA PROVIDENCIA" FARMING COMMUNITY
AREA.

   THE CIVILIAN PATROL WAS RETURNING TO ITS COMMUNITY ON 17 AUGUST,
WHEN THE ARMY TROOPS, WHO WERE ALSO SEARCHING FOR THE REBEL COLUMN,
FIRED AT THEM BELIEVING THEY WERE PART OF A REBEL GROUP.

   THE CIVILIAN PATROL UNIT, APPROXIMATELY 70 PERSONS, DID NOT FIRE
BACK AT THE SOLDIERS.  ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY ONE OF THE
SURVIVORS, THE CIVILIANS SHOUTED AND MADE SIGNS TO THE TROOPS UNTIL,
FINALLY, THE SOLDIERS REALIZED THEIR ERROR.  THE SOLDIERS, HOWEVER,
REALIZED THEIR MISTAKE ONLY AFTER NINE CIVILIANS HAD BEEN KILLED.

   GUATEMALAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR ALEJANDRO GRAMAJO WAS
QUERIED ABOUT THE INCIDENT. HE SAID IT WAS CAUSED BY "REGRETTABLE
CONFUSION" AND THAT AN ARMY COMMAND STAFF COMMISSION HAD ALREADY BEEN
SENT TO INVESTIGATE IT.

   GRAMAJO SAID THE COMMISSION IS TO ESTABLISH HOW THE INCIDENT
OCCURRED, BUT ADMITTED THAT INITIAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THERE HAD
BEEN CONFUSION BETWEEN ARMY AND PAC UNITS.

   THE MILITARY CHIEF SAID: "THE INFORMATION WE HAVE UP TO NOW IS
CONFUSING AS BOTH THE ARMY AND PAC HAD MOVED MEN BECAUSE THERE WERE
REPORTS THAT A REBEL UNIT WAS IN THE AREA."

[MARIBEL OSORIO] [TEXT] MEDELLIN CONTINUES TO LIVE THROUGH A WAVE OF
TERROR.  FOLLOWING LAST NIGHT'S ATTACK ON A BANK, WHICH CAUSED A LOT
OF DAMAGE, A LOAD OF DYNAMITE WAS HURLED AGAINST A POLICE STATION.
FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS HURT.  HOWEVER, AT APPROXIMATELY 1700 TODAY A
BOMB EXPLODED INSIDE A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT.

   A MEDIUM-SIZED BOMB EXPLODED SHORTLY BEFORE 1700 AT THE PRESTO
INSTALLATIONS LOCATED ON [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND PLAYA AVENUE.
APPROXIMATELY 35 PEOPLE WERE INSIDE THE RESTAURANT AT THE TIME.  A
WORKER NOTICED A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE UNDER A TABLE WHERE MINUTES BEFORE
TWO MEN HAD BEEN SEATED.  AFTER AN INITIAL MINOR EXPLOSION, THE
PACKAGE EXPLODED.  THE 35 PEOPLE HAD ALREADY BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE
BUILDING, AND ONLY 1 POLICEMAN WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED; HE WAS THROWN TO
THE GROUND BY THE SHOCK WAVE.  THE AREA WAS IMMEDIATELY CORDONED OFF
BY AUTHORITIES WHILE THE OTHER BUSINESSES CLOSED THEIR DOORS.  IT IS
NOT KNOWN HOW MUCH DAMAGE WAS CAUSED; HOWEVER, MOST OF THE DAMAGE WAS
OCCURRED INSIDE THE RESTAURANT.  THE MEN WHO LEFT THE BOMB FLED AND
THERE ARE NO CLUES AS TO THEIR WHEREABOUTS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 OCT 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY, RELIEF
ORGANIZATIONS EVACUATED DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE LOCKED INSIDE "LA
CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING IN SAN SALVADOR WHERE THE COSTA RICAN
EMBASSY IS LOCATED.  HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BE OCCUPIED BY
APPROXIMATELY 50 DEMONSTRATORS.

   AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ AND ANOTHER TWO DIPLOMATS, AS WELL AS
THREE SALVADORAN TELEVISION JOURNALISTS, ARE STILL BEING HELD HOSTAGE.

   APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE LEFT THE BUILDING IN WHICH THEY WERE LOCKED
FOR 5 HOURS FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS AND
SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES
OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES (FECMAFAM) OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND
MURDERED AND MISSING PEOPLE.

   THE AMBASSADOR AND OTHER EMBASSY OFFICIALS STILL REMAIN ON THE
THIRD FLOOR OF THE BUILDING, WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF RIOT
POLICEMEN EXPERT IN ANTITERRORIST STRUGGLE, ARMED WITH HIGH-CALIBER
RIFLES.

   RED CROSS, GREEN CROSS, AND RELIEF COMMAND MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN
THE EVACUATION OF THE OFFICES IN THE BUILDING.

   COLONEL ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN
NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT "THE PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED WITHIN THE
NEXT 24 HOURS, BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES RULED OUT THE USE OF FORCE.

   MAURICIO SANDOVAL, DIRECTOR OF THE PRESIDENCY'S COMMUNICATIONS
SECRETARIAT, WENT TO "LA CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING, LOCATED IN EL
SALVADOR'S BUSINESS DISTRICT, TO LEARN ABOUT THE SITUATION AND
DESCRIBED THE OCCUPATION AS A "PROPAGANDA ACT" IN VIEW OF THE FACT
THAT THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND
THE GUERRILLAS, SCHEDULED FOR 16 AND 17 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE (COSTA
RICA), IS DRAWING CLOSER.

   THE FECMAFAM OCCUPIED THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY TO PROTEST "AN
INCREASE IN REPRESSION AGAINST POPULAR ORGANIZATIONS UNLEASHED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S FASCIST GOVERNMENT," FECMAFAM SPOKESMEN SAID.

   MOST OF THOSE OCCUPYING THE EMBASSY ARE WOMEN WEARING WHITE SCARFS
AND YOUTHS CARRYING WET HANDKERCHIEFS TO AVOID THE EFFECTS OF TEAR
GAS.

   SANDOVAL DISCLOSED THAT A WORKING COMMISSION HAS BEEN FORMED TO
MAINTAIN CONSULTATIONS WITH THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT "AND IS MAKING
PERTINENT CONTACTS" TO SEEK A QUICK SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.

   THE OFFICIAL STRESSED: "WE WILL NOT BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS" WITH THE
EMBASSY OCCUPIERS, WHOM, ACCORDING TO THE AMBASSADOR, ARE ARMED.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ALSO REPORTED THAT, IN THE WAKE OF THESE
INCIDENTS, FERNANDEZ HAD A SLIGHT CARDIAC PROBLEM, BUT HAS ALREADY
GOTTEN OVER IT.

   ACCORDING TO THIS OFFICIAL, FERNANDEZ' WIFE SENT HIM MEDICINE AND
FOOD.

   SANDOVAL ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE WILL BE ISSUED
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 18 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE
AZCONA HOYO TODAY SAID THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR HAS REACHED
"ABOMINABLE AND HORRENDOUS" EXTREMES.

   THE PRESIDENT CITED THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IN SAN
SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER AS PROOF OF "THE INCREDIBLE LEVELS OF VIOLENCE
REACHED IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY."

   AZCONA SAID THAT HE IS BEING KEPT INFORMED ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS
IN EL SALVADOR, EVEN SPEAKING WITH HIS COUNTERPART, ALFREDO CRISTIANI,
BUT DID NOT VOLUNTEER ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE MATTERS DISCUSSED.

   VARIOUS HONDURAN POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE EXPRESSED VIEWS SIMILAR TO THOSE VOICED BY THE PRESIDENT OF
HONDURAS, A COUNTRY THAT SHARES A 417-KM BORDER WITH EL SALVADOR.

   IN A STATEMENT RELEASED TODAY, THE HONDURAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE
"DEPLORED THE SAD INCIDENTS THAT RESULTED IN THE COLD-BLOODED MURDER
OF SIX JESUITS."  THE HONDURAN BISHOPS STRESSED THAT "THE FRATRICIDAL
STRUGGLE IS A BITTER RESULT OF THE INJUSTICE THAT THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUFFERING."

   IN SIMILAR TERMS, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE SOCIAL
DEMOCRATIC INNOVATION AND UNITY PARTY, AGREED THAT VIOLENCE IN EL
SALVADOR FINDS ITS ROOTS IN THOSE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND ACTIONS IN
FAVOR OF THE OPPRESSED AND THE PEOPLE'S TRUE LIBERATION.

   THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE
SALVADORAN MILITARY SITUATION, AND THEY ALSO CONDEMNED THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).  RANKING OFFICERS, INCLUDING
NEW MILITARY COMMANDER COLONEL ARNULFO CANTARERO, MAINTAINED THAT EL
SALVADOR IS A VICTIM OF "COMMUNIST AGGRESSION."

   HOWEVER, THE MILITARY OFFICERS SAY THAT THEY WILL REMAIN OUTSIDE
THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, WHICH INCREASED WHEN THE INSURGENTS BEGAN A
GENERAL OFFENSIVE A WEEK AGO.


TST2-MUC4-0072

   LIMA, NO DATE (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT GARCIA]
[EXCERPTS] [CONTINUED] I BELIEVE THAT THE CLIMATE OF FLEXIBILITY IS
EMBRACING THE ENTIRE POLITICAL, MILITARY, AND ECONOMIC WORLD SYSTEM
AND THAT THE BANKS WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH COLLECTING LESS THAN
WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.  THERE WAS A TRIUMPHANT PRESENTATION OF
AN OFFER TO REDUCE A COUNTRY'S DEBT BY UP TO 20 PERCENT, BUT AS FAR AS
WE KNOW THAT OFFER HAS NOT MATERIALIZED.  FURTHERMORE, A 20-PERCENT
REDUCTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS
OF POVERTY AND THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF LATIN AMERICA.  THE
REDUCTION MUST BE MUCH GREATER.  A REDUCTION OF 10 OR 20 PERCENT WILL
DO LITTLE; EVERYTHING WILL REMAIN THE SAME.  WE BELIEVE -- AND I HAVE
BEEN SAYING THIS TO EVERY LATIN AMERICAN PRESIDENT -- THAT ONLY
THROUGH OUR ADOPTION OF FIRM AND DIGNIFIED POSITIONS WILL THE
ADVERSARY RELENT.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   [GARCIA] LET ME NOW SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT A DIFFERENT SUBJECT, THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. I BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION
HAS RAISED A TEMPEST IN A TEACUP; IT HAS RAISED AN ISSUE THAT IS OF NO
RELEVANCE TO THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE.  FIRST, WE UPHOLD THE CONCEPT OF
UNIVERSALITY OF RELATIONS, OF MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH ALL NATIONS.
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH NORTH
KOREA A FEW MONTHS AGO; HE DID NOT HAVE TO FACE A SAVAGE OPPOSITION
TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS THROWING HIMSELF INTO THE ARMS OF TERRORISM.
NOBODY HAS COMPLAINED TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ OR TO SALINAS DE GORTARI
ABOUT MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.  FOR THAT MATTER, NOBODY
HAS OBJECTED IN BOLIVIA, AUSTRIA, OR SWEDEN, BECAUSE IN THOSE
COUNTRIES THERE IS NO REACTIONARY RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT TO RECOGNIZE
NORTH KOREA IS TO COURT DESTRUCTION.

   SECOND, SOMEONE -- AND I DO NOT WANT TO MENTION HIM BY NAME -- HAS
SAID THAT RELATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH A TERRORIST STATE.
THIS IS A TREMENDOUS ERROR, BECAUSE 20,000 RIFLES SOLD TO US BY NORTH
KOREA AT $90 APIECE -- $10 LESS THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD -- HAVE
MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SAVE AND DEFEND THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
CIVILIAN GUARDS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE AND HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO
ELIMINATE AND ERADICATE SUBVERSION IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   THIRD, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO BE AUCTIONED OFF
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.  IF SO WE WOULD HAVE TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH
AUSTRALIA OR WITH FINLAND.  ONE MUST MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH ALL THE
PEOPLES OF THE WORLD.  UNDER SUCH CRITERIA, SINCE PERU RECOGNIZES THE
FRG, IT SHOULD CLOSE ITS EMBASSY IN THE COMMUNIST GDR.  THIS MANICHEAN
CRITERION, THIS OBTUSE CRITERION, THIS OUTMODED CRITERION IS NO LONGER
VALID; THE BERLIN WALL HAS BEEN RAZED.  HOW CAN ONE SAY THAT THIS
COUNTRY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND ANOTHER SHOULDN'T?  PERU WILL NOT
ACCEPT ANY IMPERIALIST VETO ON ITS WORLD RELATIONS.  WE HAVE HAD
ENOUGH OF THE 1960'S AND 1970'S WHEN PASSPORTS SAID WE COULD NOT
TRAVEL TO THE SOVIET UNION OR CUBA.  PERUVIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO
TRAVEL WHEREVER THEY WISH, LIKE THEY WISH, AND WHEN THEY WISH.  THIS
IS FREEDOM, AND IT CANNOT BE CURTAILED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
OFF-LIMITS AREAS AROUND THE GLOBE.

   FINALLY, SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO NOW OPPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA HAVE BEEN HONORED, ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS OF
THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT.  THE OTHER DAY I HEARD SOME PEOPLE
SPEAKING VEHEMENTLY ON THIS TOPIC, WHILE SOME OTHER PEOPLE NEARBY HAD
BEEN HONORED GUESTS THERE.  JOURNALISTS CAN SEEK OUT AND DETERMINE HOW
MANY OF THOSE WHO NOW OPPOSE THESE RELATIONS HAVE BEEN HONORED GUESTS
IN NORTH KOREA FOR WEEKS.  NOW, FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEY ARE
OPPOSED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. [END

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] MSGR GREGORIO ROSA
CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SAID TODAY THAT PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S MESSAGE REVEALING THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS
REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE SIX JESUITS' SLAYING REPRESENTS "A DECISIVE
TURN TOWARD THE END OF IMPUNITY" IN THE COUNTRY.

   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID IN HIS SUNDAY HOMILY THAT "THIS HAS AUGMENTED THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO RECOVER THEIR TRUST IN THE
GOVERNMENT'S INSTITUTIONS."

   NEVERTHELESS, IN A STATEMENT GIVEN LATER TO THE MEDIA, THE
AUXILIARY BISHOP EMPHASIZED THAT THE IMPLICATED MILITARY "DO NOT
REPRESENT ISOLATED CASES OF PERSONS WHO VIOLATED THE NORMS OF AN
INSTITUTION, BUT ARE ACTUALLY PART OF A FORMATION AND THOUGHT SCHEME
ACCORDING TO WHICH THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS SOMETHING
SUBVERSIVE."

   ACCORDING TO ROSA CHAVEZ, "THE MILITARY WORLD WRONGLY UNDERSTANDS
THE CHURCH'S MISSION IN THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS."

   "ASKED ABOUT EVENTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES NOT SPECIFIED BY THE
PRESIDENT, ROSA CHAVEZ ANSWERED: "THIS GRAVE ACTION IS THE RESULT OF A
CONSPIRACY--AT LEAST A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE."

   HE EMPHASIZED THAT, CONSEQUENTLY, THE STEP TAKEN YESTERDAY BY THE
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT "IS VERY IMPORTANT, EVEN IF IT IS NOT THE LAST
ONE."

   THE BISHOP RECALLED THAT THIS YEAR IS THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF MSGR
OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S ASSASSINATION, "WHICH HAS YET TO BE SOLVED,"
AND ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO CARRY OUT "ALL THE LEGAL ACTIONS TO
INVESTIGATE THE CASES OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHOSE
LIVES WERE TAKEN BY GUERRILLA GROUPS OR THE ARMY."

   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT THE CHURCH FULLY AGREES THAT THE CRIMES OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SHOULD BE
INVESTIGATED "WITH THE SAME ZEAL" WITH WHICH THE JESUIT PRIESTS'
SLAYING HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED.

   "HOWEVER, WE HAVE ASKED THAT THE INVESTIGATION BE EXHAUSTIVELY AND
THOROUGHLY CARRIED OUT WITHOUT GIVING IT A PROPAGANDISTIC APPEARANCE,"
HE ADDED.

   THE BISHOP EMPHASIZED THAT THE TWO IDEOLOGIES CONFRONTING EACH
OTHER IN EL SALVADOR EQUALLY DISDAIN HUMAN RIGHTS.

   "MARXISM IS THE ROOT OF THE FMLN'S ABUSE AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY
DOCTRINE REPRESENTS THE BASIS OF THE ARMED FORCES' UNACCEPTABLE
REPRESSION," HE SAID.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] THE MAIN REASON FOR COMING UP WITH THIS VERSION WAS TO
[WORDS INDISTINCT] MASTERMINDS OF THE CRIME [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO FIND
OUT WHO THE PERPETRATORS WERE.  WITH THIS VERSION, CRISTIANI AND THE
HIGH COMMAND ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR
THE TRIAL AND TO PLACE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF THE
JESUITS ON MID-LEVEL MILITARY OFFICERS.  THE COLONELS WHO WERE
INVOLVED IN THE CRIME COULD BE SET FREE AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WOULD
ONLY BE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED WITHIN AN
AREA UNDER THEIR COMMAND.

   THIS VERSION OF THE CRIME IS AIMED AT LEAVING THE ARMED FORCES HIGH
COMMAND FREE FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND TO ONLY SLIGHTLY TOUCH THE
MEMBERS OF LA TANDONA, ESPECIALLY COL ORLANDO CEPEDA, WHO WAS THE ONE
WHO SIGNED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE JESUITS, AND COL RENE EMILIO
PONCE, CHIEF OF STAFF.  COL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES, WHO IS A MEMBER OF
LITTLE IMPORTANCE WITHIN LA TANDONA, WAS INDIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE
CRIME.

   HOWEVER, THE [WORD INDISTINCT] IS SELF-EVIDENT.  THE DECISION TO
CARRY OUT AN OPERATION TO KILL POPULAR AND RELIGIOUS DEMOCRATIC
LEADERS WAS MADE BY THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES [WORDS
INDISTINCT] 4 DAYS AFTER THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BEGAN.  THIS OPERATION WAS
PART OF A COMPLETE COUNTEROFFENSIVE PLAN OF THE ARMED FORCES, WHICH
INCLUDED THE MASSIVE USE OF ALL THE FIREPOWER OF THE AIR FORCE AGAINST
POOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE KILLING OF DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AND
CHURCH LEADERS.

   ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WHO WAS TAKEN TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE GENERAL
STAFF FOR SECURITY REASONS AND ASSUMED CONTROL OF THE DEFENSE PLAN,
WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE GENOCIDE PLAN.  U.S. OFFICERS AND ADVISERS WERE
ALSO AT THE GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS AT THE TIME TO DISCUSS AND
APPROVE THIS GENOCIDE PLAN.

   THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED ON THE EVENING OF 16 NOVEMBER.  ALL LABOR
UNION OFFICES IN SAN SALVADOR WERE LOOTED.  THE OFFICES OF
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, POLITICAL PARTIES, AND RELIGIOUS CENTERS
WERE ALSO LOOTED.

   THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED AT THE INSTALLATIONS OF THE UCA.  THE DAYS
THAT FOLLOWED SAW A CONTINUATION OF THE ARRESTS, PERSECUTIONS, AND
ASSASSINATIONS.  THE OFFICES OF ALL THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] WERE
ATTACKED.  ITS LEADERS WERE FORCED TO SEEK REFUGE OR TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY TO ESCAPE THIS MANHUNT.  THIS IS A POLICY FOR WHICH THE HIGH
COMMAND AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THE U.S.  AMBASSADOR AND U.S. EMBASSY PERSONNEL ARE FULLY
AWARE OF THIS.

   THE NEED TO COME UP WITH THIS VERSION COMES FROM THE PRECARIOUS
PREDICAMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE FOUND
THEMSELVES IN IN VIEW OF THE DEBATES TAKING PLACE IN THE U.S.
CONGRESS TO DECIDE THE FATE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR, WHICH IS LINKED TO
THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT
PRIESTS ON 16 NOVEMBER.

U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT HERCULES C-123 CARGO PLANE WAS PARTIALLY
DESTROYED EARLY THIS MORNING WHEN AN INCENDIARY BOMB EXPLODED AT THE
MONTERIA AIRPORT.  MONTERIA IS THE CAPITAL OF CORDOBA DEPARTMENT AND
IT IS LOCATED 490 KM NORTH OF BOGOTA.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MONTERIA POLICE ADVISED AFP VIA TELEPHONE THAT
THE FRONT PART OF THE PLANE, AS WELL AS THE COCKPIT, WERE BURNED WHEN
A BOMB, PLANTED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS, EXPLODED.  NO VICTIMS WERE
REPORTED.

   THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BOGOTA CONFIRMED THAT THE PLANE WAS "SERIOUSLY
DAMAGED" BY THE FLAMES; HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY DID NOT SPECIFY THE
ORIGIN OF THE FIRE.  ACCORDING TO EMBASSY SPOKESMAN PETER SAMSON, THE
PLANE IS THE PROPERTY OF THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNATIONAL
NARCOTICS MATTERS (INM).

   THE PLANE, WHICH WAS RETURNING TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER
FULFILLING A MISSION IN PERU, HAD BEEN PARKED AT THE MONTERIA AIRPORT
FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS.  THE PLANE WAS FORCED TO LAND IN MONTERIA AFTER
ONE OF ITS ENGINES FAILED, THE EMBASSY SPOKESMAN ADDED.

   ACCORDING TO THE MONTERIA POLICE, THE FIRE BROKE OUT AFTER AN
EXPLOSION WAS HEARD.  THE FIREMEN INTERVENED QUICKLY TO PREVENT THE
FIRE FROM SPREADING AND COMPLETELY DESTROYING THE PLANE.

   THE FIRE BROKE OUT AT 0430 (0930 GMT), A FEW HOURS BEFORE TWO C-130 
PLANES--U.S. MILITARY CARGO PLANES--ARRIVED AT BOGOTA AIR FORCE

THE REPORT STATES THAT DURING TODAY'S CLASHES IN CIUDAD DELGADO, LOS
ALPES, GUADALUPE, AND SAN PATRICIO NEIGHBORHOODS, THE TREASURY POLICE
SUFFERED THREE CASUALTIES.  WE INFLICTED TWO CASUALTIES ON THE
TREASURY POLICE IN LOS ALPES NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE 6TH MILITARY
DETACHMENT SUFFERED ONE CASUALTY DURING A CLASH IN SAN PATRICIO
NEIGHBORHOOD.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FORCES HAVE SET UP BARRICADES ON THE
NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD AND POWER LINES HAVE BEEN SABOTAGED.  AS A RESULT
OF THIS SABOTAGE, AN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR DOES NOT HAVE POWER.  WE
HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT TWO TRANSFORMERS WERE DESTROYED ON KM 10 OF THE
NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD, WHERE BARRICADES WERE ALSO SET UP.  THE REPORT
ADDS THAT THE ENEMY SHOWED UP 90 MINUTES AFTER THE BARRICADES HAD BEEN
SET UP AND HEAVY FIGHTING RESULTED.  THE ENEMY TROOPS SUFFERED FOUR
CASUALTIES; OUR FORCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED
PROBLEMS ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD.  AT THIS HOUR, 1613 [2213 GMT],
THE REBEL PRESENCE IN INCREASING ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD.

   ATTENTION: DURING YESTERDAY'S ATTACK, WITH PEOPLE'S ARTILLERY ON
4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, WE INFLICTED EIGHT CASUALTIES.  THESE
EIGHT CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED.

   AT NOON TODAY, CLASHES WITH 1ST MILITARY DETACHMENT TROOPS WAS
REPORTED IN LA CRUZ HILL, SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES JURISDICTION.  WE
REPEAT: TODAY AT NOON, FIGHTING WAS REPORTED IN LA CRUZ HILL, SAN
MIGUEL DE MERCEDES, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.

   THIS HAS BEEN THE LATEST REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED.  THERE IS
FIGHTING IN CIUDAD DELGADO, LOS ALPES, GUADALUPE, SAN PATRICIO, AND
OUR GUERRILLA COLUMNS ARE SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE NORTHERN PART OF
THE CITY.  IT IS NOW 1615 [2215 GMT] AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAS NOT
REACTED.  THIS GIVES US AN IDEA OF HOW LOW MORALE IS AMONG THE
SOLDIERS IN SAN SALVADOR.  THIS NEW BLOW AGAINST THE ENEMY FORCES IN
SAN SALVADOR HAS CAUSED THE MORALE OF THE ENEMY FORCES TO DROP EVEN
FURTHER.

   ATTENTION: WE HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A REBEL AMBUSH
IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR.  THE REPORT ADDS THAT AT 0630
[1230 GMT] TODAY, REBEL FORCES AMBUSHED A VEHICLE TRANSPORTING
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN. THE AMBUSH OCCURRED ON KM 9.5 ON THE NORTHERN
TRUNK ROAD.  THE GUARDSMEN WERE HEADING INTO AN AREA WHERE THE FMLN
REBELS HAVE SET UP BARRICADES.  A POWERFUL GUAZAPA-TYPE MINE AND
RIFLES WERE USED IN THE AMBUSH.  AT LEAST 10 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING A
NATIONAL GUARD OFFICER, WERE INFLICTED.  WE REPEAT: A NATIONAL GUARD
OFFICER IS INCLUDED AMONG THE CASUALTIES WE INFLICTED DURING THIS
AMBUSH CARRIED OUT ON KM 9.5 ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD.

   LIKEWISE, WE HAVE LEARNED THAT FIGHTING CONTINUES IN MEJICANOS,
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CIUDAD DELGADO, AND SOYAPANGO.  HEAVY FIGHTING IS ALSO
BEING REPORTED IN APOPA AND MARIONA.  REBEL FORCES ARE SPREADING OUT
THROUGHOUT THE NORTHERN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR AND THEY ARE FINDING
LITTLE RESISTANCE.  AT 1616 [2216 GMT], THIS HAS BEEN THE REPORT
RECEIVED AT RADIO VENCEREMOS.  WE ARE RECEIVING REPORTS FROM OUR
LIBERATED TERRORITORIES, FROM CHALATE [CHALATENANGO], MORAZAN,
SAN MIGUEL.  GREETINGS TO OUR FORCES IN SAN SALVADOR; ONWARDS FIGHTING
COMRADES; OUR PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING YOU IN SAN SALVADOR.

   BOGOTA, 27 AUG 89 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] THE RESPECTED EL ESPECTADOR
NEWSPAPER HAS REPORTED THAT COLOMBIAN JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE
GREIFF, A KEY OFFICIAL IN THE WAR ON DRUG TRAFFICKING, HAS RESIGNED.

   MEANWHILE, MEDELLIN METROPOLITAN POLICE ANNOUNCED THAT, EARLY THIS
MORNING, UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS PLACED 11 BOMBS IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENT
BANK BRANCHES. SEVEN OF THESE BOMBS EXPLODED, CAUSING DAMAGE, BUT
THERE WERE NO VICTIMS.

   JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF, 32, WENT TO THE UNITED STATES ON
25 AUGUST TO SUBMIT A SPECIFIC PLAN ON THE USE OF A $2-MILLION U.S.
GRANT TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO COLOMBIAN JUDGES.

   EL ESPECTADOR SAID THAT "RUMORS OF A POSSIBLE CABINET RESHUFFLE
GREW, AND IT WAS FULLY CONFIRMED THAT JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE
GREIFF HAD RESIGNED AND WILL STAY FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD IN THE
UNITED STATES."

   A JUSTICE MINISTRY SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE NEWSPAPER
REPORT, BUT A POLITICAL SOURCE OF THE RULING PARTY TOLD REUTER HE HAD
HEARD THE MINISTER WAS GOING TO RESIGN.

   ANOTHER SOURCE SAID GREIFF WILL STAY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 12
DAYS AND THAT SHE WILL TENDER HER RESIGNATION UPON HER RETURN.

   GREIFF, WHO WAS APPOINTED ON 16 JULY, WAS ASKED BEFORE LEAVING THE
COUNTRY IF SHE WAS A WARTIME OR PEACETIME MINISTER.  SHE REPLIED: "I
AM A PEACETIME MINISTER."

   LOCAL NEWS MEDIA AND POLITICAL SECTORS INTERPRETED THIS COMMENT AS
AN ADVANCED NOTICE OF HER RESIGNATION.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 18 MAY 90 (VENEZOLANA DE TELEVISION CANAL 8)
-- [TEXT] GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS PRESENTED TO THE
VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT A PROPOSAL TO RESTRUCTURE THE SAN JOSE
AGREEMENT.  THE PROPOSAL COVERS THE SUPPLY OF OIL AND THE SALE OF
FINISHED PRODUCTS.  ANOTHER POINT INCLUDED IS THE REFINANCING OF THE
GUATEMALAN DEBT WITH VENEZUELA, WHICH TOTALS $200 MILLION.

   THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT'S ACTIVITIES BEGAN TODAY AT MIRAFLORES
PALACE WHEN, PRIOR TO THE SIGNING OF THE TWO AGREEMENTS, THE
VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HELD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH HIS GUATEMALAN
COUNTERPART.  THE PRESIDENTS THEN HELD A FORMAL WORK SESSION WITH THE
PARTICIPATION OF TWO COMMISSIONS AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL.  GUATEMALA,
LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT, ARE
FACING THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HONOR ALL COMMITMENTS ON DEBTS
AS THEY MATURE.  THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT WAS ONE
OF THE POINTS DISCUSSED BY PRESIDENT CEREZO DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE
TODAY AT THE AYACUCHO ROOM OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] WE HAVE PROPOSED A 20-YEAR TERM TO
RESTRUCTURE THE DEBT, WITH A SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AT FOUR PERCENT
INTEREST.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE USUAL PROCEDURE AT THE
VENEZUELAN INVESTMENT FUND NOR IS THIS INCLUDED IN THE SAN JOSE
AGREEMENT.  FOR THESE REASONS, BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT FIT
VENEZUELAN LAW, WE NEED TO DISCUSS AND ADJUST THE TERMS TO THE LAW AND
THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, THERE IS WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THE
TERMS.  WE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME PROPOSAL TO THE
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, FROM WHOM WE EXPECT THE SAME ATTITUDE AND
UNDERSTANDING, AND WE ARE CERTAIN WE WILL HAVE IT. [END RECORDING]

   WITHIN THE FORMAL CEREZO VISIT, TWO IMPORTANT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN
VENEZUELA AND GUATEMALA WERE SIGNED TODAY.  ONE OF THEM IS A
COOPERATION AND FRIENDSHIP AGREEMENT.  ANOTHER IS A SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT IN ENERGY AND MINING MATTERS,
WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN BILATERAL RELATIONS.  AS ENERGY AND MINES
MINISTER CELESTINO ARMAS SAID UPON SIGNING THE AGREEMENTS, THIS WILL
PERMIT CARRYING OUT JOINT OIL EXPLORATION OPERATIONS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARMAS] FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE AREA OF OIL
EXPLORATION, THERE ARE VERY INTERESTING PROSPECTS IN GUATEMALA THAT
COULD RESULT IN GREAT INTEREST FOR GUATEMALA AND FOR VENEZUELA.  WITH
REGARD TO MINING, WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING
SOME PROGRESS IN THE MINING SECTOR IN GUATEMALA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF
HELPING GUATEMALA DISCOVER MINERAL DEPOSITS THAT COULD BE VERY
ATTRACTIVE FOR OUR ECONOMIES. [END RECORDING]

   FOLLOWING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE MIRAFLORES PALACE,
GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO WENT TO THE CELA [ECONOMIC
COMISSION FOR LATIN AMERICA].  THE CEREZO AGENDA INCLUDED A DINNER HE
WILL HOST TONIGHT FOR HIS COUNTERPART CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.

   BOGOTA, 20 AUG 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER AND
SEVEN POLICEMEN WERE KILLED TODAY IN SOUTHERN COLOMBIA WHEN GUERRILLAS
DYNAMITED THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELLING, HUILA DEPARTMENT
AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED.

   THE SOURCES ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO MEMBERS OF THE 17TH FRONT OF
THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA (PRO-SOVIET FARC) WHICH
OPERATES IN THAT REGION, ABOUT 250 KM FROM BOGOTA.

   AFTER AMBUSHING THE PATROL ON A HIGHWAY LEADING TO SAN ANTONIO
BAJO, THE REBELS STOLE THE POLICEMEN'S WEAPONS, WHICH CONSISTED OF 8
RIFLES, 2 GUNS, 1 GRENADE, AND 1,600 CARTRIDGES.

   COMBINED ARMY AND POLICE TROOPS, SUPPORTED BY HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS,
IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THE PURSUIT OF THE REBELS WHO FLED TOWARD THE
EASTERN MOUNTAIN REGION.

   BEIJING (PRC), 16 FEB 90 (SHIJIE ZHISHI) -- [ARTICLE] [SHEN AN]
[TEXT] AT THE END OF 1989 AND AT THE BEGINNING OF 1990, THE UNITED
STATES CONDUCTED TWO MAJOR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN LATIN AMERICA, TO
THE UNANIMOUS CONDEMNATION OF THE NATIONS OF LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER
PARTS OF THE WORLD.  HOWEVER, THE FIGHTERS FOR "FREEDOM," "DEMOCRACY,"
AND "HUMAN RIGHTS" IN WESTERN NATIONS HAVE KEPT QUIET OUT OF FEAR OF
THE NAKED AGGRESSION AND THE WAY OF THE TYRANT.

   ON 20 DECEMBER 1989, SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF U.S.  TROOPS,
EQUIPPED WITH THE MOST UP-TO-DATE WEAPONS, BRAZENLY INTRUDED INTO
PANAMA, TOPPLING THE NORIEGA GOVERNMENT AND FORCING MANUEL ANTONIO
NORIEGA TO BE TRIED IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS U.S. ACT WAS BY NO
MEANS LESS THAN THE SOVIET ACT OF INVADING CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND
KIDNAPPING ITS LEADERS AT THAT TIME.  THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT
ESTIMATED THAT THE U.S. INVASION HAD RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF AT
LEAST 600 PANAMANIAN SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS AND MADE SEVERAL TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS.  MORE THAN 5,000 MILITARY AND
ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT WERE ARRESTED BY
U.S. TROOPS, AND PANAMA SUFFERED ECONOMIC LOSSES OF $10 BILLION.  THE
UNITED STATES OPENLY MANIPULATED THE WORK OF ESTABLISHING A NEW
PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, NATIONAL DEFENSE ARMY, POLICE FORCE, AND OTHER
STATE APPARATUSES, SO MUCH SO THAT IT RUSHED IN AND RAIDED [AS
PUBLISHED] THE EMBASSIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN PANAMA OR DIPLOMATIC
APARTMENTS, AND DETAINED THE DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.
UNDER THE POWERFUL PRESSURE OF WORLD OPINION, SOME OF THE U.S. TROOPS
HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM PANAMA, BUT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TO
PULL OUT ALL ITS TROOPS.

   JUST AFTER ITS INTRUSION INTO PANAMA, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
IMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED, AS SCHEDULED, THE DISPATCH OF A STRONG FLEET OF
WARSHIPS INTO THE CARIBBEAN, CLOSE TO THE COAST OF COLOMBIA, FOR WHAT
WAS CALLED AN ANTIDRUG MANEUVER, INTERCEPTING PLANES AND VESSELS FOR
TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS.  ON 5 JANUARY THIS YEAR, THE UNITED STATES,
IGNORING THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, ORDERED A
FLEET OF FOUR WARSHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER "KENNEDY" AND
NUCLEAR-PROPELLED CRUISER "VIRGINIA," TO SAIL TOWARD THE CARIBBEAN TO
"COMBAT DRUG SMUGGLING."  SUCH A HIGH-HANDED WAY OF IGNORING THE
SOVEREIGNTY AND WILL OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS AND FORCING THE
DEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN FRONT OF THE GATES OF OTHER COUNTRIES EVOKED
FIERCE REACTIONS IN COLOMBIA AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS.
JARAMILLO OSSA, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FROM THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOTIC
UNION, NOTED THAT THE UNITED STATES "VERY NEARLY" INVADED COLOMBIA.
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO WARNED THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT: WITHOUT THE
AUTHORIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT BARCO, NO U.S WARSHIPS
ARE ALLOWED TO DRAW NEAR [AS PUBLISHED] THE WATERS OF COLOMBIA.  IT
ALSO ORDERED ITS NAVAL AND AIR FORCES TO INTENSIFY THEIR SEA PATROLS
TO SAFEGUARD THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE
GOVERNMENTS OF COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA, AND SOME OTHER NATIONS REFUSED TO
JOIN THE PROPOSED U.S. "DRUG-FIGHTING DRILL" IN THE CARIBBEAN.  FACED
WITH SUCH A SITUATION, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD TO ORDER THE
"DRUG-FIGHTING FLEET" TO RETURN TO BASE AND CANCEL THE "DRILL."

   ON THE AFOREMENTIONED ACTS OF THE UNITED STATES, LEADERS OF SOME
LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS COMMENTED: WHILE RELAXING THE TENSION WITH THE
SOVIET UNION, THE UNITED STATES HAS RESERVED THE "RIGHT" TO INTERFERE
BY FORCE IN LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER SMALL AND WEAK COUNTRIES.  THE
PUBLIC MEDIA OF SOME NATIONS SOLEMNLY POINTED OUT: SUCH MOVES OF U.S.
AGGRESSION ARE THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONSISTENT U.S. POLICY OF
INTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF LATIN AMERICA AND ALSO THE EXTENSION OF
WHAT IS CALLED THE REAGAN DOCTRINE, WHICH STARTED IN THE EARLY 1980'S.

   IN U.S. RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA THROUGHOUT THE DECADE OF THE
1980'S, THERE WAS A PROBLEM AFFECTING THE SITUATION AS A WHOLE,
NAMELY, THE ISSUE OF CENTRAL AMERICA, WHICH HAD ALL ALONG BEEN LISTED
IN THE CATEGORY OF EAST-WEST CONFRONTATION BY THE UNITED STATES.  THE
REAGAN ADMINISTRATION EVEN GAVE TOP PRIORITY TO MEETING THE CRISIS IN
CENTRAL AMERICA IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY.

   IN 1981, WHEN REAGAN ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE, THE SITUATION IN
CENTRAL AMERICA STOOD AS FOLLOWS: THE SANDINISTA REVOLUTION HAD WON
VICTORY IN NICARAGUA, THE GUERRILLA WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS ESCALATING,
AND A TURBULENT SITUATION HAD STARTED TO EMERGE IN OTHER CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS DIPLOMACY PURSUED BY THE CARTER
ADMINISTRATION RESULTED IN THE DETERIORATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH A
CERTAIN NUMBER OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS RULED BY JUNTAS.  IN 1977 THE
CARTER ADMINISTRATION SIGNED THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY WITH THE
PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, AGREEING TO RETURN TO PANAMA SOVEREIGNTY OVER
THE CANAL AND THE CANAL ZONE.  BEFORE THE VICTORY OF THE NICARAGUA
REVOLUTION, IN 1979 THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION ABANDONED ITS SUPPORT
FOR THE TYRANNICAL SOMOSA REGIME AND ESTABLISHED NORMAL RELATIONS WITH
THE SANDINISTA REGIME.  [SENTENCE AS PUBLISHED] [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER, SIN] [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR REPORTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL
COMMUNITY THAT THE TERRORIST OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FML].  AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAS
BEEN COUNTERED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS
CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S LIVES
AND POSSESSIONS. THE SITUATION IS UNDER THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES'
CONTROL.

   THE FLMN, WITH A TOTAL DISREGARD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, HAS UNLEASHED AN
INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK ON VARIOUS PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR AND ON THE
CAPITALS OF FOUR DEPARTMENTS BY FIRING VERY POWERFUL WEAPONS AND KILLING
MANY CIVILIANS.  

   THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY REPORTS THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS BECAUSE THE
FMLN ATTACKS ON MILITARY OBJECTIVES HAVE SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED THE
LIVES OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.

   THIS FMLN ATTACK IS TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED BECAUSE THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS ATTENDED THEM
WITH TOTAL POLITICAL HONESTY, TRYING TO FIND MECHANISMS AND RATIONAL
SOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT.  THE FMLN NOT ONLY HAS VIOLATED THE
AGREEMENTS IT SIGNED IN MEXICO CITY, BUT ALSO IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.
IT HAS ALSO BRAZENLY MOCKED THE FEELINGS AND THE DESIRE FOR PEACE
WANTED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THE FMLN TERRORIST ACTIONS HAVE FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE USE
OF ITS LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFEND SOCIETY BY USING THE ARMED FORCES
WHICH HAS BEEN FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO
NOT WANT TO LOSE THEIR LIBERTY AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF TOTALITARIAN
MARXIST-LENINIST SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ONE THE FMLN WANTS TO IMPOSE
RUTHLESSLY.  REPRESENTATIVES FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHO HAVE OBSERVED
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE INCIDENTS CAN FULLY CONFIRM THE FACTS.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN ADDITION TO BEING VICTIMS OF THE FMLN
AGGRESSION, FEEL OUTRAGED BECAUSE THE FMLN STILL HAS THE GALL TO SAY
THAT IT IS SPEAKING IN DEFENSE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO, IN THESE
SAD TIMES, FEEL OUTRAGED BY THE TERRORIST GROUP'S IRRATIONAL ATTACK.

   THE GOVERMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR REQUESTS THAT THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CONDEMN THIS BRUTAL VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
PERPETRATED BY THE FMLN.  IT ALSO ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO
CONDEMN THE HIDEOUS CRIMES THE FMLN TROOPS ARE PERPETRATING AGAINST
CIVILIANS -- WHO FLATLY REFUSE TO HELP THEM -- AND WHO HAVE REJECTED
THEM [3 SECOND BREAK IN TRANSMISSION].  THE GOVERNMENT ALSO REQUESTS
THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY STRONGLY CONDEMN NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT
ORTEGA BECAUSE HE SUPPLIED THE WEAPONS THAT THE TERRORISTS ARE USING
TO MASSACRE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   BOGOTA, 7 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL
COORDINATING BOARD [CNG) ASKED TODAY THAT THE DIALOGUE THE GOVERNMENT
HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL HOLD WITH TWO OF THE SIX ARMED
ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY BE HELD "WITH ALL" [ARMED
GROUPS].

   THE CNG ALSO REQUESTED AN "OPEN AGENDA" FOR ALL OF THESE TALKS AND
PRAISED THE "GOVERNMENT'S RECENT WILLINGNESS TO HOLD TALKS."

   IN ITS REQUEST FOR A "DIALOGUE WITH ALL," THE CNG, THROUGH A
DECLARATION ISSUED "FROM THE COLOMBIAN MOUNTAINS" AND BROADCAST ON THE
MEDIA, STATES: "WE HAVE NAMED A HIGH-LEVEL COMMISSION AND EXPECT THE
GOVERNMENT TO DO THE SAME."

   IN ITS DECLARATION, THE CNG "REITERATES ITS DESIRE TO FIND A
POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT" IN COLOMBIA.  "WE ARE
PLEASED ABOUT THE PATH THAT IS BEING OPENED TOWARD CONSTITUTIONAL
REFORMS THROUGH THE REFERENDUM AND THE PLEBISCITE," THE DOCUMENT ADDS.

   HOWEVER, THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO MAINTAINS THAT "IN VIEW OF THE VARIOUS
APPROACHES SUGGESTED, WE REAFFIRM OUR BELIEF THAT ONLY A NATIONAL
CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WITH BROAD POPULAR PARTICIPATION WILL ENSURE THAT
THE CHANGES DEMANDED BY THE MAJORITIES WILL BE MADE."

   IN ADDITION TO THE NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, "THERE SHOULD
ALSO BE TRUE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTIVE
EXERCISE OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY."

   THE DECLARATION CONDEMNS "THE DIRTY WAR, WHICH, IN THE PAST FEW
DAYS, HAS RESULTED IN THE ASSASSINATIONS OF JUDGES, LEFT-WING
POLITICAL LEADERS, LABOR UNION LEADERS, AND PEASANTS, AND IN THE
ATTEMPTED MURDER OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES."

   THE DOCUMENT IS SIGNED BY JACOBO ARENAS, IDEOLOGUE AND LEADER OF
THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA, AND BY JAVIER ROBLES FROM
THE PRO - MAOIST POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY.  IT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK
THAT THESE GROUPS WILL JOIN THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

   GILFARDO FERNANDEZ FROM THE PRO - INDIAN QUINTIN LAME FRONT AND
VALENTIN GONZALEZ FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS PARTY ALSO SIGNED THE
DOCUMENT.

   THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT -- WHICH, SINCE JANUARY, HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING
WITH THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS REINCORPORATION INTO CIVILIAN LIFE -- AND
THE PRO - CASTRO ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION -- WHICH HAS ALWAYS
REFUSED TO HOLD A DIALOGUE -- ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE CNG.

   HAMBURG (FRG), 16 DEC 89 (DIE WELT) -- [INTERVIEW WITH CHILEAN
PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN BY WERNER THOMAS] [TEXT] DIE WELT: YOUR
THOUGHTS ARE FOCUSED ON CHILE, BUT LET US BRIEFLY LOOK AT EUROPE
NEVERTHELESS.  THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN EAST EUROPE HAS ALSO BEEN
A SENSATION TO CHILE.  WHAT HOPES DO YOU PLACE IN THESE GIGANTIC
RADICAL CHANGES?

   AYLWIN: I THINK THAT THE CHANGES IN EAST EUROPE ARE OF VERY GREAT
IMPORTANCE FOR MANKIND.  THEY GIVE US SATISFACTION AND HOPE.  THE
OPENING OF THE BERLIN WALL SYMBOLIZES THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA IN
RELATIONS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST AS WELL AS THE DESIRE OF THE GERMANS
TO ACHIEVE UNITY AGAIN.  WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS SITUATION LEAD TO A
REDUCTION IN MILITARY SPENDING AND TO CLOSER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE
PEOPLES.

   DIE WELT: WHAT EFFECTS DO YOU SEE FOR A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY SUCH AS
CHILE?

   AYLWIN: I SEE TWO EFFECTS.  FIRST, A SYMBOLIC EFFECT.  CHILE IS
TRADITIONALLY A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.  NOW THE LONG PERIOD OF A
DICTATORIAL REGIME IS ENDING, HOWEVER.  THIS EXPLOSION OF FREEDOM
COINCIDES WITH THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CHILE.  THAT IS A
STIMULATING FEELING.  WE ARE EMBARKING ON THE ROAD OF HUMANITY.
SECOND, THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE DANGER OF COMMUNISM IN OUR
COUNTRY; PEOPLE SAY THAT COMMUNISM COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR DEMOCRATIC
FUTURE.  I THINK THAT THE EVENTS IN EAST EUROPE AND THE SOVIET UNION
DEMONSTRATE THAT COMMUNISM IS NO LONGER A DANGER FOR THE WORLD.  NOR
FOR CHILE.

   DIE WELT: CHILE HAS THE BEST ORGANIZED COMMUNIST PARTY IN LATIN
AMERICA.  HAS THIS PARTY CHANGED?  WHAT WAS ITS REACTION?

   AYLWIN: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SITUATION OF SUCH A MONOLITHIC
AND COHERENT PARTY.  IT WAS ILLEGAL AND WORKED UNDERGROUND FOR A LONG
TIME.  HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY COMMUNIST PARTY CAN IGNORE
THE EVENTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN DOMINATED
BY COMMUNIST PARTIES.  THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERS HAVE
ADMITTED THAT THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROCESS.

   DIE WELT: WHAT RELATIONSHIP DO YOU HAVE WITH VOLODIA TEITELBOIM,
THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY?  DO YOU SPEAK WITH HIM?
DO YOU SEE HIM SOMETIMES?

   AYLWIN: WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BOTH
SENATORS, MEANING PRIOR TO 1973.  WE WERE POLITICAL OPPONENTS, BUT WE
OFTEN TALKED WITH EACH OTHER.  SINCE THEN, WE HAVE MET ONLY ONCE, AT A
POLITICAL FUNCTION.  MY RIVALS IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAVE OFTEN
MISREPRESENTED OUR RELATIONSHIP, AND HAVE DESCRIBED ME AS TEITELBOIM'S
SECRET ALLY.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT PERSUASIONS
CAN TALK WITH EACH OTHER AND CAN REACH AGREEMENT.  THAT HAS BEEN DONE
IN CHILE WITH SOME SUCCESS.

   DIE WELT: THE COMMUNIST PARTY BACKED YOUR CANDIDACY.  WILL IT BE
REPRESENTED IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT?

   AYLWIN: NOT AT ALL.

   DIE WELT: BUT THE FUTURE GOVERNMENT WILL BE A LEFT-CENTER
GOVERNMENT AND WILL REFLECT THE COMPOSITION OF THE OPPOSITION
TODAY.

   AYLWIN: YES, CHILE WILL HAVE A LEFT-CENTER GOVERNMENT.  THE VARIOUS
SOCIALIST CURRENTS WILL BE REPRESENTED.  HOWEVER, THE STRONGEST
MOVEMENT IS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IS IN THE CENTER.

   DIE WELT: DO YOU THINK THAT FOLLOWING THESE ELECTIONS, THE PANORAMA
OF THE OPPOSITION WILL CHANGE?

   AYLWIN: I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.  THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR FAMILIES
IN THE PAST -- THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC FAMILY, THE SOCIAL
DEMOCRATICALLY-ORIENTED FAMILY OF THE OLD RADICAL PARTY, THE SOCIALIST
FAMILY, AND THE FAMILY OF THE RIGHT CENTER.  THEY ALL WANT TO SURVIVE.

   DIE WELT: MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SOCIALIST RICARDO LAGOS IS THE
STRONGEST FIGURE OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.  WHAT ROLE WILL HE PLAY
IN THE FUTURE?

   AYLWIN: HE WILL CONCENTRATE ON PARLIAMENTARY WORK AS A SENATOR.  AS
IS THE CASE IN EVERY PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, HE CANNOT BE A MEMBER OF
THE GOVERNMENT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF CONGRESS.  [CONTINUED]

(M-19) "TEAM OF SPOKESMEN" AT THE NARINO PALACE.  BARCO AND THE M-19
MEMBERS TALKED ABOUT THE PEACE PROCESS STARTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE GUERRILLAS.

   A PRESIDENTIAL PALACE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE GUERRILLA
REPRESENTATIVES DISCUSSED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO SOME OF THE ISSUES TO
BE DEBATED AT THE "WORKING ROUNDTABLES."  THE "WORKING ROUNDTABLES"
COMPRISE DELEGATES OF THE GUERRILLAS, THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE
POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED IN THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS, WHO WILL
EXCHANGE VIEWS ON THE CHANGES THE COUNTRY NEEDS.

   THE M-19 DELEGATES ARRIVED AT THE NARINO PALACE, LOCATED IN
DOWNTOWN BOGOTA, UNDER STRICT SECURITY MEASURES AT 1800 LOCAL TIME
(2300 GMT).

   MEANWHILE, AT THE PEACE VILLAGE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CAUCA
DEPARTMENT, 350 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA, M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO
LEONGOMEZ RELEASED A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH HE ACCUSED THE COLOMBIAN ARMY
OF ATTACKING AN M-19 GROUP ON 26 MARCH.  ACCORDING TO PIZARRO, THE
ATTACK WAS STAGED BY THE MILITARY TO "CREATE OBSTACLES FOR THE PEACE
PROCESS."  HE ADDED THAT COMMANDER MARCO CHALITA, COMMANDER OF THE
M-19'S "SOUTHERN FRONT," WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED IN THE FIGHTING.

   ON 26 MARCH, 9TH BRIGADE TROOPS CLASHED WITH THE "AMANDA RINCON"
GROUP, LED BY CHALITA, IN A RURAL AREA OF PITALITO MUNICIPALITY, HUILA
DEPARTMENT.  DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL MANUEL JAIME GUERRERO PAZ
DESCRIBED THE CLASH AS "AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT."

   PIZARRO SAID IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE PEACE VILLAGE TODAY THAT
THE TROOPS ATTACKED THE REBELS AND THAT "TWO OF OUR COMRADES WERE
KILLED AND THREE OTHERS WOUNDED."

   THE M-19 COMMANDER SAID "HE SHARED THE DEFENSE MINISTER'S
VIEWPOINT," AND HE SAID "OBSTACLES STILL MUST BE OVERCOME" TO ACHIEVE
A NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.

   THE M-19 BEGAN TALKS WITH THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN JANUARY.
FOLLOWING A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT BARCO'S ENVOYS, THEY
AGREED ON THE CREATION OF "ROUNDTABLES."  LAST WEEK, THE M-19 AND
GOVERNMENT MINISTER RAUL OREJUELA MET AT THE PEACE VILLAGE, WHERE THE
GUERRILLAS PRESENTED THE NAMES OF THE DELEGATES THAT WOULD PARTICIPATE
AT THE "ROUNDTABLES," WHICH ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN DELIBERATIONS ON 3
APRIL.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 29 APR 88 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYO BY FRANCISCO VALERIANO GIRON] [TEXT] [BEGIN
RECORDING] [GIRON] IS THERE ANY UNREST BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE LAWS
PASSED BY CONGRESS?

   [AZCONA] NO, THERE IS NO UNREST BECAUSE OF LAWS PASSED BY CONGRESS.
SOME MEASURES THAT HAVE AFFECTED INCOME HAVE BEEN ADOPTED, BUT WE WILL
MAKE PROGRESS ANYHOW.

   [GIRON] WILL YOU ASK THAT SOME OF THESE LAWS BE RECONSIDERED?

   [AZCONA] NO, I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT.  THERE IS, HOWEVER, THE LAW
ON COFFEE TAXES WHICH COULD BE DISCUSSED WITH PRODUCERS BECAUSE THE
LAW-DECREE ON COFFEE IS VERY DRASTIC.  HOWEVER, THE COUNTRY IS MAKING
PROGRESS, AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN VARIOUS SECTORS--COMMERCE,
CONSTRUCTION, AND MANUFACTURING--ARE ON THE INCREASE.  SOME SECTORS
HAVE SOME PROBLEMS, BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO RESOLVE THOSE
PROBLEMS.

   [GIRON] DO YOU HAVE ECONOMIC ADVISERS, MR PRESIDENT?

   [AZCONA] ANY PERSON CONSULTED IS AN ECONOMIC ADVISER.  THE MAIN
ECONOMIC ADVISERS, HOWEVER, ARE THOSE IN THE GOVERNMENT.

   [GIRON] IT IS BEING SAID THAT POLITICALLY SPEAKING YOU HAVE BEEN
LEFT ON YOUR OWN.  IS THIS HOW YOU SEE IT ALSO?

   [AZCONA] NO WAY.  HOW COULD I BE ALONE? ON THE CONTRARY, WE ARE
DOING WELL.  I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO RECEIVE MORE SUPPORT.  I DO NOT
SEE WHY I COULD BE LEFT ALONE.  THERE IS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
EXPERTS.  WE ARE ESTABLISHING RELATIONS WITH THE PARTY, WITH THE MOST
IMPORTANT PEOPLE OF THE PARTY.

   [GIRON] ARE EMPLOYEES GOING TO BE PRESSURED?

   [AZCONA] I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO DO
ANYTHING BECAUSE NO LAW SAYS THAT THE EMPLOYEES OF A GOVERNMENT MUST
SUPPORT ANY PARTICULAR PARTY.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT IF THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH WORKS IN UNISON, AS IT HAS BEEN DOING, THEN ALL MEMBERS OF THE
LIBERAL PARTY WILL BE HAPPY TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARTY TO
GUARANTEE A NEW VICTORY.

   [GIRON] WOULD YOU SUPPORT REFORMS TO THE ELECTORAL LAW?

   [AZCONA] WE DISCUSSED THAT ISSUE TODAY.  APPARENTLY THE NATIONAL
CONVENTION, WHICH IS THE PARTY'S TOP AUTHORITY, HAS APPROVED SOME
REFORMS.

   [GIRON] DO YOU AGREE WITH INTERNAL ELECTIONS TAKING PLACE
SIMULTANEOUSLY [AS HEARD]?

   [AZCONA] I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IF THEY TAKE PLACE IN ONE
SINGLE DAY, BUT WE DID NOT DISCUSS THAT TODAY, AND I DO NOT WANT TO
DISCUSS DETAILS ABOUT THAT.

   [GIRON] DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EITHER YOUR GOVERNMENT OR YOURSELF
COULD HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY HARMED BY THE LATEST CRISIS ENDURED BY THE
COUNTRY?

   [AZCONA] I DO NOT THINK SO.  I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED WILL BENEFIT
THE COUNTRY.  ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE REGRETTABLE, BUT THOSE THAT HAVE
TAKEN PLACE HAVE SHOWN THAT WE IN HONDURAS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO VIOLENCE.
THE SAME DAY INCIDENTS WERE TAKING PLACE HERE, 13 PERSONS DIED IN SAN
SALVADOR AS A RESULT OF A BOMB EXPLOSION.  THE LOSS OF LIVES IS
UNFORTUNATE AND VIOLENCE AGAINST A BUILDING AND FACILITIES NEXT TO THE
U.S. EMBASSY IS REGRETTABLE BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT HELP THE COUNTRY.

   [GIRON] HAVE YOU TALKED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ABOUT AN
INDEMNITY?  IT IS BEING SAID THAT DAMAGE AMOUNTS TO $6 MILLION.

   [AZCONA] NO, WE HAVE NOTHING ABOUT $6 MILLION.  WHAT WE HAVE
RECEIVED IS A NOTE FROM THE U.S. AMBASSADOR THE DAY AFTER THE
INCIDENTS.  THEY ARE ENTITLED TO FILE A PROTEST.  THE NOTE SAYS THAT
LATER THERE WILL BE A [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   HONDURAS SIGNED THE GENEVA CONVENTION ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
GOVERNMENTS WHEN ACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT AGAINST DIPLOMATIC
INSTALLATIONS.

   [GIRON] THE FORCING OF RADIO STATIONS TO JOIN A RADIO NETWORK AND
THE IMPOSING OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF MUCH
CRITICISM AGAINST YOUR GOVERNMENT.

   [AZCONA] I HAVE HEARD SOME CRITICISM BECAUSE OF THE NETWORK.
PERHAPS WE HAD IT FOR A FEW HOURS TOO MANY.  REGARDING THE STATE OF
EMERGENCY, HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED POSITIVELY BECAUSE ONE
MORE CASUALTY WOULD HAVE HAD NEGATIVE EFFECTS.  THE STATE OF EMERGENCY
MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO COOL DOWN, AND THOSE ON THE STREETS
RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES.  I FEEL IT WAS BENEFICIAL.  THE DECLARATION OF
EMERGENCY DECREE WAS BASED ON THE CONSTITUTION AND ON PRESIDENTIAL
AUTHORITY.  CONGRESS WAS INFORMED ABOUT THIS.

   I BELIEVE THIS WAS A POSITIVE MEASURE, AND THIS IS HOW THE PEOPLE
HAVE VIEWED IT, POSITIVELY.

   [GIRON] DO YOU BELIEVE THE SITUATION HAS BEEN OVERCOME?

   [AZCONA] WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE SITUATION IS OVER.  I THINK SO.  I
BELIEVE THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT TEMPERS GOT HOT FOR A MOMENT, AND
THAT SOME SECTORS, WHICH I DO NOT WANT TO NAME BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN
IDENTIFIED BY THE PEOPLE, TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS.  PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE
TRIED TO MAKE POLITICAL GAINS AND THE SITUATION GOT OUT OF HAND.

   I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT EVERYTHING IS MORE OR LESS QUIET.  THE
GOVERNMENT IS TALKING WITH THE VARIOUS SECTORS.  THERE IS A SMALL
STRIKE BY A SMALL GROUP OF HEALTH WORKERS.  CHECKS WITH SALARY
INCREASES COVERING A 4-MONTH PERIOD WILL BE PAID TODAY.  SOME
READJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE TO FAVOR SOME EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE NOT
RECEIVED THE INCREASES WE HAD PROMISED.

   WE WANT TO APPEAL TO HEALTH SECTOR LABOR UNIONS TO SET ASIDE ANY
CONFRONTATIONAL ATTITUDE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS MEETING AND WILL
MEET ALL ITS COMMITMENTS.

   [GIRON] WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE LATEST INCIDENTS WITH
NICARAGUA?

   [AZCONA] THESE ARE NOT THE FIRST INCIDENTS.  I BELIEVE INCIDENTS
WILL CONTINUE HAPPENING.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO
ENFORCE RESPECT FOR THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY.  [END RECORDING]

ATTENTION; PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.  WE HAVE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING REPORT
FROM ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT:

   WE DENOUNCE -- OUR COMRADES HAVE DENOUNCED -- THE ROLE PLAYED BY
THE GREEN CROSS, WHICH HAS BEEN DISLODGING THE POPULATION IN THE
FOLLOWING NEIGHBORHOODS: 27 DE SEPTIEMBRE, CHINCHONTEPEC, AND SANTA
LUCIA, LOCATED IN NORTHERN ZACATECOLUCA.

   THE GREEN CROSS IS SERVING AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR DMIFA [ARMED FORCES
ENGINEERS' MILITARY DETACHMENT] TO DISLODGE THE POPULATION.
SOME DMIFA AGENTS ARE WEARING GREEN CROSS UNIFORMS TO DO THAT JOB.
THEY GO FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE, IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES WITH GREEN CROSS
DOCUMENTS.  THEY ARE ASKING FAMILIES ONE BY ONE TO MOVE OUT, TELLING
THEM THAT THOSE AREAS WILL BE BOMBED.

   WE URGE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE RED CROSS, THE GREEN CROSS, AND
RESCUE TEAMS NOT TO PERMIT THE USE OF INSIGNIAS, UNIFORMS, AND
VEHICLES OF HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS BY ARMY TROOPS.

   THE DISLODGING OF PEOPLE IN SAN SALVADOR AND NOW IN THE 27 DE
SEPTIEMBRE NEIGHBORHOOD IN ZACATECOLUCA IS BEING DONE IN ORDER TO
PROCEED WITH THE BOMBING OF THESE DENSELY POPULATED CIVILIAN
NEIGHBORHOODS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT] [GENERAL
RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS, SALVADORAN DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY
MINISTER] [TEXT] DEAR SALVADORAN PEOPLE, OUR REPUBLIC, OUR SOCIETY,
AND OUR PEOPLE BECAME THE VICTIMS OF A MURDEROUS AND TERRORIST
AGGRESSION 8 DAYS AGO.  THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
CARRIED OUT AN INCURSION IN OUR COUNTRY AND VENTED ALL ITS FURY AND
ALL ITS TERROR AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THIS VIOLENT,
IRRATIONAL, ILLOGICAL, AND SENSELESS ACTION BEGAN 8 DAYS AGO AGAINST
PEACE-LOVING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK, CHOOSE THEIR OWN DESTINY, AND
SEEK THEIR WELFARE.

   ON THIS OCCASION I AM DEEPLY MOVED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S
ATTITUDE, AND, IN MY ROLE AS DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTER, I
HEARTILY CONGRATULATE THEM.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE HAS
REFLECTED THEIR STOICISM, STRONG WILL, AND INDOMITABLE SPIRIT, HOPE,
AND FAITH IN GOD AND THE ARMED FORCES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, YOUR ATTITUDE IN RECENT DAYS HAS BEEN DIGNIFIED
AND IT HAS SET AN EXAMPLE.  IT IS WORTHY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO
HAVE ALWAYS PROVED THEIR FAITH AND WILLINGNESS TO DEFEND A JUST AND
NOBLE CAUSE, THE HOMELAND'S CAUSE.  THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HAS GIVEN
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THE WILL TO LIVE, LOVE, AND ACHIEVE PEACE.

   YOUR ATTITUDE ENCOURAGES US, PLACES US UNDER AN OBLIGATION, AND
URGES US -- AS AN INSTITUTION AT THE SERVICE OF THE PEOPLE -- TO
CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE TO THE END, SO THAT WE MAY ERADICATE FOREVER THE
TERROR, VIOLENCE, AND DISRESPECT THAT THE TERRORIST FORCES HAVE TRIED
TO IMPOSE ON OUR HARD-WORKING AND INNOCENT PEOPLE.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, YOUR ATTITUDE IS EXEMPLARY, AND WE, THE
PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS, ARE PREPARED -- LIKE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN -- TO
SUPPORT AND DEFEND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN ANY EVENT THE
SECURITY, ORDER, TRANQUILLITY, WORK, AND PEACE THAT ALL THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO ENJOY.

   ONWARD, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. AS AN INSTITUTION WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT.
YOUR SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS NECESSARY.  YOU
MUST BELIEVE IN AND TRUST THE ARMED FORCES, BECAUSE WE, WHO ARE ALSO
PEOPLE LIKE YOU, UNDERSTAND THE LEGITIMATE DEMAND AND DESIRE FOR
PEACE, FAITH, AND HOPE WHICH PREVAIL IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF ALL
SALVADORAN CITIZENS -- AND WE ARE PLEASED AND SATISFIED TO DEFEND
THEM.

   THE ARMED FORCES ARE AN INSTITUTION WHICH HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
GUARANTEEING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S WELFARE, AND THEY ARE HIGHLY
ENCOURAGED, DEEPLY PLEASED, AND DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THEIR WORK.
THEY WILL DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND GUARANTEE THEM A FUTURE
WITH DIGNITY, PEACE, WELFARE, AND SECURITY.  [CONTINUED]

   HAVANA (CUBA), 14 NOV 89 (TELE-REBELDE NETWORK) -- [TEXT] GUERRILLA
UNITS ARE FIGHTING SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FORCES A FEW METERS FROM
THEIR GENERAL BARRACKS AND IN THE CAPITAL NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN MARTIN
AND GENERAL ARCE.

   A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT, FMLN, AND BROADCAST BY RADIO VENCEREMOS INDICATES THAT THE
INSURGENT FORCES THIS MORNING PENETRATED PERIPHERAL NEIGHBORHOODS OF
SAN SALVADOR.  THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO SAYS THAT HEAVY FIGHTING IS TAKING
PLACE NEAR THE SAN BENITO POLICE BARRACKS, THE ZONA ROSA, THE NATIONAL
MUSEUM, AND THE INTERNATIONAL FAIR.  RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTS THAT
FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR; IT ALSO DENOUNCED
THE DEATH OF MANY CIVILIANS DUE TO THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS OF THE
GOVERNMENT'S AIR FORCE.

   ACCORDING TO INSURGENT RADIO VENCEREMOS THE PRESENCE OF THE
GUERRILLA FORCES IN THE MAIN CITIES OF THE COUNTRY HAS ENCOURAGED
POPULAR UPRISINGS AND THE GROWING PARTICIPATION OF THE POPULATION IN
THE STRUGGLE.  THE REPORT ADDS THAT THE REBEL UNITS CONTINUE FIGHTING
THE ARMY IN SEVEN OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   BOGOTA, 20 APR 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE HAD
TO STRUGGLE AGAINST MANY OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN'S SKEPTICISM AND
PESSIMISM.  THE FIRST THING THE GOVERNMENT DID WAS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS
BASES TO WAGE A STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS WITH WHATEVER
FIRMNESS AND PERSEVERANCE WAS CALLED FOR.

   WE STRENGTHENED INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATIONS, WE CREATED SPECIAL
PUBLIC COURTS.  WE MODIFIED PENAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES.  WE INTRODUCED
NEW MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND TO PROTECT
CITIZENS.  WE FORMED NEW COMPONENTS TO BOLSTER OUR PUBLIC FORCES. OUR
EFFORTS TOOK QUITE A BIT OF TIME.  ONE CANNOT PROVIDE AN OVERNIGHT
SOLUTION FOR THESE COMPLEX PROBLEMS WITH WHICH YOU ARE ALL VERY
FAMILIAR.

   ONCE THE INSTITUTIONS IN CHARGE OF MAINTAINING PUBLIC ORDER AND
SECURITY WERE STRENGTHENED, WE CONCENTRATED OUR AVAILABLE RESOURCES ON
SOLVING THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE RESULTS
HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY POSITIVE, BOTH IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING -- WHICH IS THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF MANY OF THESE TERRORIST
GROUPS -- AND IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST GANGS OF HIRED ASSASSINS AND
PRIVATE JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS, ALSO KNOWN AS DEATH SQUADS.

   NEVER BEFORE HAD WE ACHIEVED SUCH POSITIVE RESULTS.  I AM SURE THAT
EVEN THOUGH WE WILL FACE DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES, WE WILL CONTINUE
TO WIN THIS BATTLE AGAINST TERRORISM.  TO DATE, WE HAVE DISBANDED 23
GANGS OF HIRED ASSASSINS OPERATING IN ENVIGADO IN ANTIOQUIA
DEPARTMENT, HUICAN IN BOYACA DEPARTMENT, PUERTO LOPEZ AND SAN MARTIN
IN META DEPARTMENT, LA ROCHELA IN SANTANDER DEPARTMENT, AND LLANOS DEL
YARI IN CAQUETA DEPARTMENT.  THESE GANGS OF HIRED ASSASSINS HAD
PARTICIPATED IN MOST OF THE MURDERS OF THE COUNTRY'S LEFTIST LEADERS.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 18 MAY 90 (EL GRAFICO) -- [TEXT] GENERAL HECTOR
GRAMAJO MORALES HAS REPORTED THAT LAST NIGHT'S TERRORIST ACTS WERE
PROBABLY INTENDED TO DAMAGE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS, BUT
ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WENT OFF PREMATURELY.

   HE ADDED THAT ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HIT A WALL OF THE AIR
FORCE INSTALLATIONS AND THE SHOCK WAVE FROM THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED SOME
BUILDINGS.

   ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS, THE ATTACK WAS PROBABLY A
PROPAGANDA PLOY BECAUSE THE DEVICES WERE RUDIMENTARY AND SIMILAR TO
FIRECRACKERS.

   THE TERRORIST ACTIONS SEEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT THE
IRREGULAR GROUPS ARE SHRINKING CONSIDERABLY.  EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THE
FACT THAT A SUBVERSIVE WHO SURRENDERED ON THE SOUTHERN COAST WAS
CARRYING SOME IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE GUERRILLAS ADMITTED
THAT THEY HAD MADE A BIG EFFORT TO SHOW THEIR PRESENCE, BUT THAT
NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL RESULTED AND THEY SUFFERED MANY CASUALTIES
INSTEAD, GRAMAJO SAID.

   WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THESE TERRORIST
ACTIONS ON THE TALKS BEING HELD IN OSLO, NORWAY, GRAMAJO SAID THAT
THOSE WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THE TALKS DO NOT MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH
THE GROUPS THAT CARRY OUT THE TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   AMONG THOSE GROUPS, THERE IS ONE FACTION THAT IS CALLED THE
INTERNATIONAL MILITANT GROUP.  THIS FACTION IS COMPRISED OF PERSONS
WHO LOVE ADVENTURE; THESE PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS
TO ENGAGE IN SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES.

   LIMA, 21 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PERUVIAN NAVY TODAY FORMALLY
DENIED THAT ITS INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAD UNCOVERED A PLOT TO
ASSASSINATE WRITER MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, WHO IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE
FAVORITE CANDIDATE TO WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT WILL BE HELD
ON 8 APRIL.

   CITING AN ALLEGED NAVY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, A TELEVISION STATION
CARRIED A REPORT -- WHICH WAS LATER PICKED UP BY A NEWSPAPER --
TACITLY SUGGESTING THAT THE COMMUNIST TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT (MRTA) AND PROMINENT PEOPLE IN THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT,
INCLUDING PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED PLOT.

   THE NAVY HAS ISSUED AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH IT DENIES THE
ALLEGED SOURCE OF THE DOCUMENT AND STATES THAT THE ALLEGATIONS,
CONSIDERING THE RANK OF THE PERSONALITIES MENTIONED, COULD BE A MATTER
AFFECTING NATIONAL SECURITY.

   THE REPORT ON THE PLOT WAS INITIALLY CARRIED BY CHANNEL FOUR DURING
A POLITICAL PROGRAM.  IT WAS LATER PICKED UP BY THE CENTER-RIGHT WING
NEWSPAPER EXPRESO, ONE OF THE LEADING NEWSPAPERS IN THE COUNTRY.

   ALVARO VARGAS LLOSA, A SON AND SPOKESMAN FOR THE PERUVIAN WRITER,
STATED THAT "WE GIVE GREAT CREDENCE TO THE DOCUMENT SHOWN ON
TELEVISION BUT THE AUTHORITIES SEEM TO HAVE IGNORED IT.  IT CONCERNS
MY FATHER AND IT SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY."

   ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT, THE AUTHENTICITY OF WHICH HAS BEEN
OFFICIALLY DENIED BY THE NAVY, AN MRTA HIT SQUAD WOULD MURDER THE
NOVELIST AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FREDEMO)
AND OTHER PERSONALITIES OF THE CENTER-RIGHT WING COALITION.

   THE REPORT ADDS THAT THE PLOT MAY HAVE BEEN CONCOCTED EARLY IN
DECEMBER LAST YEAR AT A MEETING REPORTEDLY ATTENDED BY PRESIDENT
GARCIA, INTERIOR MINISTER AGUSTIN MANTILLA, TWO SENIOR LEADERS OF THE
RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA), AND BY AN
UNIDENTIFIED MRTA MEMBER.

ARE SUSPECTED OF COLLABORATING WITH THE GANGS OF TERRORISTS THAT
OPERATE IN THE CAPITAL.  THE FOREIGNERS WERE ARRESTED IN THE VICINITY
OF THE ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH, LOCATED ON 63 AVENUE
SOUTH AND OLYMPIC AVENUE IN THIS CAPITAL.  THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED
AS: LUIS PEREZ, FRANCISCO RIERA, AND MARIA ESTER LLERENTE, SPANIARDS;
WINSTON PERCIVAL ZEA MELENDEZ, GUATEMALAN; JOSEPHINE CAMERON VICTOR,
U.S. CITIZEN; KAREN RUDD, CANADIAN; AND MARCELA RODRIGUEZ, COLOMBIAN.

   THE SPANIARDS HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE SPANISH EMBASSY, AND THE
OTHERS WERE TURNED OVER TO THE TREASURY POLICE FOR INVESTIGATION. THE
INITIAL REPORT SAYS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS CONTRAVENED THE IMMIGRATION
LAWS BY MEDDLING IN DOMESTIC POLITICAL AFFAIRS.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 27 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE GUATEMALAN
ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS (AEU), WHOSE TOP LEADERS WERE
KIDNAPPED, MURDERED, OR HAD TO GO INTO HIDING DURING THE LAST FEW
WEEKS, TODAY DEMANDED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S SOLIDARITY TO
CONTAIN THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS SHAKEN THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST
2 MONTHS.

   TWO MEMBERS OF THE AEU COORDINATING BOARD, WHO LAST WEEK WENT INTO
EXILE, SAID THAT IT IS URGENT THAT A PERMAMENT UN RAPPORTEUR BE SENT
TO GUATEMALA TO CERTIFY THE CONTINUAL AND INCREASING HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS IN THE COUNTRY.

   THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ALSO CALLED FOR GOVERNMENTS AND
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO SEND DELEGATIONS TO GUATEMALA AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE, "TO PRESSURE THE VINICIO CEREZO GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE
CAMPAIGN OF TERROR AND THE BLOODBATH BEING PREPARED BY THE ARMY TO
CONTAIN THE STUDENT AND PEOPLES' MOVEMENTS."

   THE AEU REPRESENTATIVES SAID THEY HAD EVIDENCE THAT THE RECENT
KIDNAPPING OF 12 STUDENT LEADERS, OUT OF WHICH 5 WERE LATER FOUND
MURDERED WITH BRUTAL SIGNS OF TORTURE, "WAS DIRECTLY PLANNED AND
CARRIED OUT BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMY.

   THESE SAME STUDENTS BELIEVE THAT VINICIO CEREZO'S CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT "KNOWS WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAMPAIGN OF
TERROR, AND IT WILL NOT TAKE ACTION BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS AN
ACCOMPLICE OF THE MILITARY."

   THE AEU LEADERS, WHO DID NOT DARE GIVE THEIR NAMES BECAUSE THEIR
FAMILIES "COULD SUFFER WORSE CONSEQUENCES IN GUATEMALA," INSISTED THAT
"THE ONLY THING REMAINING FOR GUATEMALANS TO FACE THE TERROR AND
VIOLENCE IS INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY."

   "THE SITUATION IS TERRIBLE.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROSECUTOR HIMSELF
TOLD US THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING TO CONTAIN THIS WAVE OF REPRESSION
AND ADVISED US THAT WE BETTER SEEK INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE," ONE OF THE
EXILED AEU LEADERS SAID.

   ACCORDING TO THEM, THE WAVE OF REPRESSION OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS
AGAINST GUATEMALAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS "IS THE WORST SINCE 1978," WHEN
NUMEROUS UNIVERSITY LEADERS WERE MURDERED, INCLUDING AEU SECRETARY
GENERAL OLIVERIO CASTANEDA, KILLED AT POINT-BLANK RANGE WHILE HEADING
A DEMONSTRATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAPITAL.

   CASTANEDA'S MURDER FORCED THE AEU TO ELIMINATE THE POST OF
SECRETARY GENERAL AND MODIFY ITS STRATEGIES SO ITS TOP LEADERS WOULD
NOT BECOME EASY TARGETS OF REPRESSION.  HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE
LATEST EVENTS, THESE CHANGES SEEM TO HAVE HAD LITTLE EFFECT.

   "BECAUSE NOW THEY CANNOT IDENTIFY ANY PARTICULAR LEADER TO KILL,
LIKE THEY DID WITH OLIVERIO, THIS TIME THEY HAVE ATTACKED US ALL," ONE
OF THE BANISHED LEADERS , WHO ARRIVED IN COSTA RICA LAST WEEKEND,
SAID.

   SINCE 21 AUGUST, WHEN THE CAMPAIGN OF STUDENT KIDNAPPINGS AND
MURDERS BEGAN, OF THE 16 MEMBERS OF THE AEU EXECUTIVE COORDINATING
BOARD, THREE WERE MURDERED, SEVEN ARE STILL MISSING, FOUR HAD TO GO
INTO HIDING, AND TWO WENT INTO EXILE.

   "I WAS TOLD THROUGH A FRIEND: YOUR TURN IS ON 4 SEPTEMBER.  I THEN
HAD TO HIDE UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY," ONE OF THE EXILED
TOLD AFP WITH ANGUISH.

   "WE REALLY DID NOT EXPECT THIS.  WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE
POLITICALLY NEUTRALIZED, BUT NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD ORDER US
KIDNAPPED AND MURDERED," ANOTHER OF THE STUDENTS ADMITTED.

   FOR BOTH LEADERS "THE ARMY'S REPRESSIVE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE AEU
SEEKS TO SCARE THE POPULATION AND STOP THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT THAT
BECAME MOTIVATED FOLLOWING THE LAST TEACHERS' STRIKE ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY."

   HOWEVER, THEY CONCLUDED, "THE ARMY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO END THE
AEU BECAUSE TO DO SO THE ARMY WOULD HAVE TO KIDNAP, MURDER, OR SEND
INTO EXILE THE 60,000 SAN CARLOS UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, THE LARGEST AND
OLDEST UNIVERSITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA."

   BOGOTA, 7 JUL 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS REPORT THAT
GUERRILLAS PRESUMED TO BE MEMBERS OF THE PRO-CASTRO ARMY OF NATIONAL
LIBERATION (ELN) TODAY ONCE AGAIN DYNAMITED THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL
PIPELINE, COLOMBIA'S MAJOR OIL PIPELINE.

   AN ECOPETROL [COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE] SPOKESMAN SAID THAT
THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT KM - 102 OF THE PIPE NEAR BENADIA IN
ARAUCA INTENDANCY, IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.

   THIS ATTACK TAKES PLACE 25 DAYS AFTER A PREVIOUS GUERRILLA ACTION,
WHICH INTERRUPTED THE PUMPING OF CRUDE THROUGH THE 780 - KM LONG
PIPELINE.  ON 16 JUNE, THE ELN DESTROYED THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL
TERMINAL ON COLOMBIA'S ATLANTIC COAST, IN WHAT IS CONSIDERED THE MOST
SERIOUS ATTACK AGAINST COLOMBIA'S PETROLEUM INDUSTRY IN ITS HISTORY.
SINCE THAT TIME, COLOMBIA HAS BEEN FORCED TO SUSPEND AN AVERAGE OF
180,000 OF THE 220,000 DAILY BARRELS OF CRUDE PIPED THROUGH THE
COUNTRY'S LEADING PIPELINE.

   TODAY'S ATTACK IS THE 25TH DURING 1989, AND THE THIRD THIS WEEK,
THE ECOPETROL SPOKESMAN REVEALED.  THE ELN'S ATTACKS HAVE REDUCED THE
NATION'S HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION THIS YEAR BY 20 PERCENT, WITH LOSSES
EXCEEDING $180 MILLION.  THE ELN HAS DYNAMITED THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS
PIPELINE 125 TIMES SINCE JANUARY 1988, CAUSING LOSSES OF MORE THAN
$450 MILLION AS A RESULT OF OIL SPILLS, HALTED PRODUCTION, THE
SUSPENSION OF EXPORTS, AND ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE, THE ECOPETROL SPOKESMAN
ADDED.

   DURING THE 25 YEARS OF ITS ARMED STRUGGLE, THE ELN -- LED BY FORMER
SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ -- HAS INTENSIFIED ITS ATTACKS AGAINST THE
PETROLEUM INFRASTRUCTURE, ARGUING THAT IT PERPETRATES THESE ACTIONS
"TO PREVENT THE EXPLOITATION OF COLOMBIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES."

COLOMBIAN ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION GUERRILLAS.

   MARCELO WAS WRITING AN ARTICLE ON THE KIDNAPPING OF THE THREE
