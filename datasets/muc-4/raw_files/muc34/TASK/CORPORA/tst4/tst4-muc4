   CONCEPCION, 23 AUG 88 (SANTIAGO DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [REPORT]
[MIGUEL ANGEL VALDEBENITO] [TEXT] POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT
UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS PLANTED A BOMB IN FRONT OF A MORMON CHURCH IN
TALCAHUANO DISTRICT. THE BOMB, WHICH EXPLODED AND CAUSED PROPERTY
DAMAGE WORTH 50,000 PESOS, WAS PLACED AT A CHAPEL OF THE CHURCH OF
JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS LOCATED AT NO 3856 GOMEZ CARRENO
STREET.

   THE SHOCK WAVE DESTROYED A WALL, THE ROOF, AND THE WINDOWS OF THE
CHURCH, BUT DID NOT CAUSE ANY INJURIES.

   CARABINEROS BOMB SQUAD PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY WENT TO THE LOCATION
AND DISCOVERED THAT THE BOMB WAS MADE OF 50 GRAMS OF AN-FO [AMMONIUM
NITRATE-FUEL OIL BLASTING AGENTS] AND A SLOW FUSE.

   CARABINEROS SPECIAL FORCES SOON RAIDED A LARGE AREA TO TRY TO
ARREST THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK, BUT THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.

IS, THE NATIONAL PROSECUTOR AND THE TALCAHUANO CRIMINAL COURT, OF THIS
ATTACK.

   LIMA, 20 AUG 88 (EFE) -- [EXCERPTS] THE PROSECUTOR OF THE MILITARY
COURT TRYING THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING OF 124 INMATES
ACCUSED OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HELD IN THE LURIGANCHO PRISON ON 19
JUNE 1986 HAS ASKED FOR 25 YEARS IMPRISONMENT FOR THE PERSON
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING.

FOR GENERAL ROLANDO CABEZAS ALARCON OF THE REPUBLICAN GUARD "FOR
ORDERING THE SHOOTING OF 124 OF THE SAN PEDRO PRISON INMATES
(LURIGANCHO)."

   THE LIMA DAILY EXPRESO SAID THAT THE PROSECUTOR DISCLOSED THAT
"AFTER THEY SURRENDERED, THE INMATES WHO HAD BEEN RIOTING IN THE
INDUSTRIAL WING OF THE PRISON WERE FORCED OUT THROUGH A HOLE IN THE
WALL TO THE BACK YARD, WHERE THEY WERE MURDERED BY TROOPS UNDER THE
COMMAND OF REPUBLICAN GUARD LIEUTENANT OSWALDO MARQUINA."

   ON ORDERS FROM GEN CABEZAS, LT MARQUINA AND THE MEN UNDER HIS

   PROSECUTOR CARBONE ASKED 15 YEARS FOR MARQUINA, WHO ALONE KILLED 22
INMATES. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   ACCORDING TO CARBONE, NO MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO MAKE THE INMATES
STOP RIOTING, NOR WAS AN OPERATION PLANNED TO REGAIN CONTROL OVER
INMATES, AND THE KILLING WAS NOT STOPPED BY THE OFFICERS WHO WERE
THERE.

   PROSECUTOR CARBONE ALSO REQUESTED 6 YEARS FOR GENERAL JORGE
RABANAL, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATION, "BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE
PREVENTED THE MASSACRE HAD HE COORDINATED ACTIONS WITH GEN CABEZAS."

   LIMA, 23 AUG 88 (EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY PERUVIAN MILITARY OFFICIALS
ESTABLISHED A CURFEW IN TINGO MARIA BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE BY PEASANTS
AND COCA GROWERS TO PROTEST THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR COCA FIELDS.

   SINCE 20 AUGUST THE STRIKERS HAVE BEEN BLOCKING THE ROAD LINKING
HUANUCO WITH TINGO MARIA, HUANUCO DEPARTMENT, IN THE NORTHERN JUNGLE
WHERE THERE IS DRUG TRAFFIC ACTIVITY.

   THE STRIKERS ALSO BLOCKED THE MARGINAL DE LA SELVA HIGHWAY,
ISOLATING TOCACHE, UCHIZA, JUANJUI, AND AUCAYACU, WHICH ARE WELL-KNOWN
CENTERS FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   THE STRIKE IS SUPPORTED BY THE SHINING PATH, ACCORDING TO REPORTS
DISCLOSED IN LIMA TODAY.

   THE COCA GROWERS OPPOSE THE USE OF THE HERBICIDE CALLED "SPIKE,"
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO USE TO DESTROY THE CLANDESTINE
COCA PLANTATIONS.

   ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL SOURCES, A GROUP OF TERRORISTS LINKED TO
DRUG TRAFFICKING REPORTEDLY WOUNDED A POLICE OFFICER IN AN ATTACK ON A
POLICE HELICOPTER. TERRORISTS ALSO ATTACKED A CIVIL GUARD POST IN
NUEVO PROGRESO, NORTH OF TINGO MARIA, UCAYALI DEPARTMENT.

OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHO WAS TRIED FOR OFFENDING
CARABINEROS.  THE MILITARY COURT ALSO DECIDED TO RELEASE SANDOVAL ON

THE ATTACK ON GENERAL PINOCHET AND THE KIDNAPPING OF COLONEL CARRENO.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT TORRES OFFICIALLY SUBMITTED A REQUEST FOR THE
EXTRADITION OF THREE CHILEANS ARRESTED NEAR BUENOS AIRES, WHO ARE
REPORTEDLY LINKED TO THE KIDNAPPING OF COL CARRENO. THE SUPREME COURT
MUST NOW PROCESS THAT REQUEST.

   CLANDESTINE, 26 AUG 88 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] AMINTA PLATERO
WAS KILLED WHEN HER CAR WAS HIT BY ANOTHER CAR DRIVEN BY FORMER DEPUTY
PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTER RINALDO GOLCHER. AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT,
GOLCHER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY U.S. MILITARY ATTACHE ANGEL MENENDEZ. THE
INCIDENT OCCURRED AT 0100 ON 26 AUGUST AT THE INTERSECTION OF WEST 1ST
STREET AND NORTH 51ST AVENUE. COL GOLCHER WAS SUPPOSEDLY IN ISRAEL
WHERE HE WAS SENT AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S MILITARY ATTACHE;
HOWEVER, THE WELL-KNOWN LEADER OF THE DEATH SQUADS WAS SEEN AT 0100 IN
DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR ACCOMPANIED BY NONE OTHER THAN THE U.S. MILITARY
REPRESENTATIVE IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS HAPPENED ONLY HOURS AFTER COLONEL
[ADOLFO ARNOLDO] MAJANO'S BODYGUARDS WERE MURDERED.

   THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THIS INCIDENT RAISE SEVERAL
QUESTIONS. WHAT WERE THESE TWO SOLDIERS DOING AT 0100? WHERE WERE
GOLCHER'S BODYGUARDS? WHERE WERE HIS COMPANION'S BODYGUARDS? THE TWO
MEN WERE PROBABLY RETURNING FROM A CORRUPTION CENTER, A NIGHT
CLUB--ONE OF THOSE EXCLUSIVE CLUBS WHERE THE U.S. ADVISERS AND OTHER
U.S. AND SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SPEND THE DOLLARS THEY STEAL
FROM THE FUNDS ALLOTTED TO EL SALVADOR AND WHERE THEY PLAN CRIMES
AGAINST THE PEOPLE.

   MUCH MORE COULD BE SAID; HOWEVER, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE INCIDENT
WAS NO MERE ACCIDENT. MRS PLATERO IS ANOTHER VICTIM OF THE MADNESS
AFFECTING AN ARMY DIRECTED BY U.S.  ADVISERS. THERE IS NOT MUCH
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS INCIDENT AND THE HURLING OF A GRENADE BY A
SOLDIER DRIVEN CRAZY BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TERRORISM PRACTICED BY THE
ARMY ADVISERS AND CHIEFS. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS THAT GOLCHER
WILL NOT BE TRIED FOR THIS NEW CRIME, JUST AS HE HAS NOT BEEN TRIED
FOR THE MANY CRIMES HE HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR AS CHIEF OF THE
REPRESSIVE CORPS AND DEATH SQUADS.

TERRORISTS RETURNED TO CUBA, FROM WHERE THEY TRAVELED TO EUROPE,

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 9 AUG 88 (LA PRENSA) -- [LETTER SENT BY
PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS TO NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT]
DEAR MR PRESIDENT:

   ON THE ROAD TOWARD ACHIEVING PEACE, WE HAVE OFTEN EXPERIENCED
SETBACKS AND DIFFICULT TIMES. POWERFUL FORCES ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFY
VIOLENCE AND WAR EVERY TIME DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS OR COMMITMENTS ARE NOT
FOLLOWED OR MET.

   WHEN THERE IS AN ARMED STRUGGLE AND WHEN THOUSANDS ARE KILLED ON
THE BATTLEFIELD, THOSE WHO PROMOTE VIOLENCE NEVER CONCLUDE FROM THOSE
USELESS KILLINGS THAT WAR IS FUTILE. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PEACE
CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION.

   IT WILL ALWAYS BE EASIER TO RECTIFY MISTAKES WHEN THE WEAKNESSES
ARE POLITICAL OR WHEN ERRORS ARE MADE ON THE ROAD TO PEACE. WE CANNOT
BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE, AND VIOLENCE BORN OF HATRED TAKES A LONG
TIME TO HEAL.

   I BELIEVE, MR PRESIDENT, THAT IT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING IF YOU WERE
TO RECTIFY SOME POLITICAL DECISIONS YOUR GOVERNMENT MADE FOLLOWING THE
UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS AT NANDAIME.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO REOPEN THE
COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA THAT ARE CLOSED. IT IS NECESSARY TO RELEASE THE
PRISONERS AND TO REVOKE THE SENTENCES IMPOSED UPON THEM AS PUNISHMENT
FOR INVOLVEMENT IN THOSE INCIDENTS.  THE PEACE PLAN TO WHICH WE ARE
COMMITTED OBLIGES US TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OUR
MOST SACRED COMMITMENT IS TO CONTINUE PROGRESSING ON THE PATH TOWARD
DEMOCRATIZATION.

   IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS
RESUME NEGOTIATIONS TO SECURE A PERMANENT END TO MILITARY ACTIONS IN
NICARAGUA. THIS COULD VERY WELL BE AN ENCOURAGING EXAMPLE FOR MANY
CENTRAL AMERICAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES. I OFFER YOU OUR COSTA RICAN
TERRITORY FOR THE RESUMPTION OF SUCH NEGOTIATIONS. I ALSO OFFER YOU
ALL THE ASSISTANCE WITHIN MY MEANS TO ENABLE SUCH NEGOTIATIONS TO TAKE
PLACE.

   I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL ATTEND THE UPCOMING INAUGURAL CEREMONY
IN ECUADOR. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A SIGN OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE
OF PEACE, A NOBLE GESTURE TOWARD RODRIGO BORJA, AND WOULD AID IN
STRENGTHENING THE ECUADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IF YOU ATTENDED THE
CEREMONY IN QUITO AFTER REVERSING THE SETBACKS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF
ANTIDEMOCRATIC ACTIONS, SUCH AS PENALIZING THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA
AND DEPRIVING MEN AND WOMEN OF THEIR LIBERTY.

   ONLY IF WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CORRECT OUR MISTAKES AND THE VISION
TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH OUTLINED IN THE PEACE PLAN CAN CENTRAL
AMERICANS PREVENT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR
PEOPLES. A LATIN AMERICAN COMMITMENT TO PEACE ALSO REQUIRES EFFORTS TO
ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY. WE WILL NOT BE GRANTED ANOTHER
POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO FORGE HISTORY. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL
BE A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR RECONCILIATION TO ALLOW TODAY'S YOUTH A
DIFFERENT FUTURE, A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO PUT ASIDE THEIR WEAPONS AND TO
WORK FOR A BETTER FUTURE.

JUDGE HAS ORDERED THE RELEASE OF FORMER CAPTAIN ALVARO SANABRIA, WHO
IS IMPLICATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO,
BECAUSE OF CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS BY A KEY WITNESS. COURT SOURCES
HAVE EXPLAINED, HOWEVER, THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WILL NOW HAVE
TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT THE ACQUITTAL OF THE SOLDIER.

   THE DECISION ISSUED BY JUSTICE ROMEO AURORA ACQUITTING AND ORDERING
THE RELEASE OF THE FORMER CAPTAIN WAS MADE, ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT,
BECAUSE AMADO ANTONIO GARAY REYES--THE ALLEGED DRIVER OF THE PERSON
WHO ASSASSINATED MSGR ROMERO--CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE WITNESS.

   THE JUDGEMENT PRESENTED TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT NOTES THAT THIS
WITNESS HAS MADE STATEMENTS THAT CONTRADICT TESTIMONY HE GAVE AT THE
4TH CRIMINAL COURT 7 YEARS AFTER THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED. FOR THIS
REASON, THE JUDGE, BASED ON ARTICLES 497 AND 498 OF THE PENAL CODE AND
ARTICLE 53 OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURES LAW HAS RULED THAT THERE
IS NO MERIT FOR ARRESTING THE MILITARY MAN, WHO HAS BEEN TRIED IN
ABSENTIA.

   HOWEVER, COURT OFFICIALS HAVE EXPLAINED THAT THIS DOCUMENT ISSUED
BY JUDGE AURORA IS ONLY A REPORT ON HIS RULING, WHICH ACCORDING TO THE
LAW CAN BE EITHER REVOKED OR CONFIRMED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.
FOR THIS REASON, THIS DECISION IS NOT BEING VIEWED AS A FINAL RULING.

[WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT AN OPINION CONTRARY TO THE CONTINUATION OF
GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET AS CHILEAN PRESIDENT WILL PREVAIL IN THE

YEARS OF SUFFERING, INCLUDING TORTURE, KILLINGS, AND HUMILIATION, SAID
NAVARRETE. HE ADDED THAT THE OPPOSITION WILL MONITOR THE BALLOTING,
THUS SAFEGUARDING THE PLEBISCITE FROM ANY FRAUDULENT ACTIONS.

   ON 30 AUGUST, THE TOP AUTHORITIES IN THE CHILEAN REGIME WILL
NOMINATE THEIR CANDIDATE--IT IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT IT WILL BE
PINOCHET--SO THAT THE CITIZENRY CAN VOTE YES OR NO IN THE PLEBISCITE,
THUS DECIDING WHETHER THIS CANDIDATE WILL GOVERN THE COUNTRY FOR THE
NEXT 9 YEARS.

   NAVARRETE ADDED THAT AFTER THE VICTORY OF THE NO VOTE, THE
OPPOSITION WILL ASK FOR ANOTHER PLEBISCITE IN ORDER TO AMMEND THE
CONSTITUTION PROMULGATED BY THE CURRENT REGIME IN 1980 SO AS TO ENSURE
A CALL FOR DEMOCRATIC, FREE, AND OPEN GENERAL ELECTIONS. NEVERTHELESS,
NAVARRETE NOTED: IF WE ARE DEFEATED HONESTLY, WE WILL RESPECT THE
PLEBISCITE'S OUTCOME, ALTHOUGH WE WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE.

KEMPFF TO COURT IN ORDER TO MAKE HIM TELL EVERYTHING HE KNOWS. HE MUST
SAY TO WHOM THE COCAINE LABORATORIES BELONG, HOW MUCH DRUG IT CAN
PROCESS, AND WHOM IT BENEFITS."

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 26 SEP 88 (TELEVISORA NATIONAL) -- [REPORT ON
NEWS CONFERENCE HELD BY ATTORNEY GENERAL CARLOS VILLALAZ, ASSISTANT
ATTORNEY GENERAL MARIO BALLESTEROS, PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES (FDP) G-2
LIEUTENANT COLONEL GUILLERMO WONG, AND NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS
DEPARTMENT (DENI) DIRECTOR LIEUTENANT COLONEL NIVALDO MADRINAN WITH
LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [BEGIN
RECORDING] [MADRINAN] THE PLAN INCLUDED SEVERAL POINTS. THE PURPOSE OF
THIS PLAN WAS TO PRESSURE GENERAL NORIEGA TO RESIGN FROM HIS MILITARY
POST IN LATE AUGUST.

   THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PLAN WERE: TO INTENSIFY AND
SPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA WITHIN THE FDP; TO INTENSIFY AND
SPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA'S COLLABORATORS BY MENTIONING
SPECIFIC NAMES; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND
THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN
COLLABORATORS THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS
UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND NORIEGA ALLIES,
PARTICULARLY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT
HIS GOVERNMENT WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE
HOSTILE TO NORIEGA, ESPECIALLY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA, THAT HE HAD
LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE
FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS THAT DEALT WITH NORIEGA, SUCH AS THE
FMLN AND THE M-19, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME
WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; AND TO MOVE THE ANTI-NORIEGA SECTOR WITHIN THE FDP
TO SUPPORT SPECIFIC ACTIONS AGAINST NORIEGA'S REGIME.

   THE FDP MEMBERS, OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WERE THE TARGETS OF THIS
PLAN.  WE SEE HOW SOME WERE TAKEN IN BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS
PLAN.  THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN WERE GEN NORIEGA, NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN
COLLABORATORS WITHIN THE FDP, SOME CIVILIANS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT
ARE NORIEGA'S ALLIES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA,
AND FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEAL WITH NORIEGA. THEY
IDENTIFIED ALL OF NORIEGA'S VULNERABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE
VULNERABILITIES OF ALL THE TARGETS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED.

   THERE WERE CERTAIN THEMES USED IN THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS,
AND THE MEDIA FELL FOR THEM MANY TIMES. THIS IS WHY WE REPEATEDLY
ASKED THEM NOT TO FALL FOR THIS MISINFORMATION.

   THESE THEMES INCLUDED: BY IMPOSING HIS ARBITRARY NATURE AND
CORRUPTION, NORIEGA IS PERVERTING THE FDP AND PROMOTING THE
DISINTEGRATION OF THAT MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE FDP HAVE BECOME A
MAFIA THAT IS HEADING TOWARD DISGRACE. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT HAS BEEN
DISCUSSED IN LEAFLETS AND MANY PUBLICATIONS.

   BY DISRUPTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AT HIS WHIM, NORIEGA IS
PROVOKING A PROFOUND SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL CRISIS THAT IS
RUINING THE COUNTRY. THIS IS DONE TO HIDE THOSE WHO ARE TRULY
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. THE LONGER NORIEGA
REMAINS IN POWER, THE MORE PROBABLE BECOMES A U.S., CUBAN, OR SOVIET
INTERVENTION.  THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS PROVOKED BY
NORIEGA NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF THE FDP MEMBERS
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

   NORIEGA'S FALL IS INEVITABLE AND THE FDP SHOULD NOT FALL WITH HIM.
TO SAVE THE FDP AND THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, THE FDP MUST REMOVE
NORIEGA FROM OFFICE. THIS IS WHY THERE WERE SIREN SONGS THAT AN
INTERNAL COUP WAS UNDER WAY.

   THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CASE FOR
5 MONTHS AND WE KNOW THE FUGITIVES ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE KNOW
WHERE THEY LEFT FROM. NO ONE CAN DENY THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTAIN U.S.
CITIZENS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION WITH THE PANAMANIAN GROUPS
THAT WERE CAPTURED.

   WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE, THE WEAPONS, THE INSTRUMENTS USED FOR
MISINFORMATION, THE PLANS, AND THE MAPS WITH THE TARGETS FOR VIOLENCE.
IMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO BE KIDNAPPED HAD ALSO BEEN MARKED
ON THESE MAPS. THEY HAD MARKED THE BRIDGES THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED.

   GENTLEMEN, WE KNOW THE POWER OF WEAPONS AND WE KNOW HOW TO USE
THEM.  WE KNOW THE DAMAGE THEY CAN DO. THEREFORE, BEFORE THERE WAS A
VIOLENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR FDP, WE
WENT ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEIR PLANS. IF ARRESTS WERE MADE, IT WAS
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH INEXPERIENCED GROUPS
THAT ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE USED FOR THE PERSONAL BENEFIT OF THOSE
WHO RECEIVED, WITH A SIREN SONG, THE PROMISE OF THE PANAMANIAN
PEOPLE'S $30 MILLION THAT ERIC ARTURO DELVALLE WAS GOING TO USE FOR
SUBVERSIVE ACTS, BLOODY ACTS TO BATHE OUR PEOPLE IN BLOOD, AS IN THE
CASE OF THE STRUGGLE OF OUR BROTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AND CENTRAL
AMERICA.

   WE WILL NOT PERMIT THAT. THAT IS WHY WE DECIDED TO GO ONE STEP
AHEAD AND FOIL THESE PLANS THAT HAVE A CERTAIN PURPOSE AND THAT WOULD
RESULT IN MOURNING AND PAIN FOR PANAMANIAN FAMILIES.

   WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED WERE DAMN WELL
ARRESTED: ALBERTO CONTE, FRED BOYD, AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES SO EDUARDO HERRERA AND FRIENDS CAN LIVE LIKE
KINGS IN THE UNITED STATETS, SO THEY CAN LIVE THEIR LIVES DRINKING
CHAMPAGNE AND EATING PHEASANT.

   EDUARDO HERRERA WAS DISMISSED FROM A DIPLOMATIC POST FOR SMUGGLING
40 BOXES OF WHISKEY PER WEEK INTO ISRAEL.  HE IS THE KIND OF PERSON
PROTECTED BY THE PENTAGON AND ELLIOTT ABRAMS. HE IS ELLIOTT ABRAMS'
HERO.

   THERESA WELLINGTON OF THE [U.S.] EMBASSY IN MEXICO, WHO GAVE THESE
PEOPLE--WHO LEFT PANAMA FOR MEXICO-- THEIR VISAS IN 10 MINUTES BY
ABRAMS' ORDERS, HAS ALSO BECOME ONE OF OUR PEOPLE'S ENEMIES. [END

HEADQUARTERS IN THE CITY OF ARICA WAS ATTACKED. THE PDC'S PREMISES ARE
LOCATED AT 683 SOTOMAYOR STREET, IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF THE CITY. THE
IDENTITY OF THE ATTACKERS IS UNKNOWN.

   THE REPORT WAS FILED BY FORMER CONGRESSMAN HUMBERTO BALZA, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE PDC'S LOCAL CHAPTER, WHO HAS ALSO RECEIVED DEATH
THREATS IN THE PAST FEW HOURS.

   THIS IS WHAT BALZA TOLD RADIO CHILENA'S "PRIMERA PLANA" FEATURE:

   [BALZA] [BEGIN RECORDING] UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS ATTACKED THE
PDC'S PREMISES, LOCATED AT 683 SOTOMAYOR STREET, BREAKING THE WINDOWS
OF THE PREMISES AND TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE DOOR. LUCKILY, OUR GUARD
WENT OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THE ATTACKERS TOOK OFF,
LEAVING ABUNDANT YES-VOTE PROPAGANDA WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE
CANDIDATE. THE ATTACKERS ALSO SHOUTED THREATS AGAINST THE MEMBERS OF
THE PARTY'S BOARD.

   WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD THE ARICA PUBLIC, BUT NOW WE WANT ALL OF THE
CHILEAN PUBLIC TO KNOW, THAT THE SUPPORTERS OF THE YES-VOTE ARE
DESPERATE, BECAUSE THEY SEE THERE ARE NOW MORE NO-VOTE SUPPORTERS THAN
YES-VOTE SUPPORTERS.

   THIS IS WHY THE LATTER ARE THREATENING PEOPLE, WHY THEY ARE TRYING
TO STEAL IDENTITY CARDS, AND WHY THEY ARE RESORTIG TO ANY TYPE OF
ACTION THAT WILL CREATE UNREST IN ORDER TO GIVE CONFIDENCE TO THE
SUPPORTERS OF THE YES-VOTE AND TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE FOR ANY TYPE OF
ACTION TO BE TAKEN ON 5 OCTOBER. [END RECORDING] [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   BOGOTA, 7 OCT 88 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] AN
EXPLOSION HAS DESTROYED A SECTION OF THE MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE RUNNING
FROM BARRANCABERMEJA TO BUCARAMANGA. THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN ALTO DE
SAN PABLO WHILE GASOLINE AND PROPANE GAS WERE BEING PUMPED TO
BUCARAMANGA. WE HAVE A REPORT NOW FROM TERESA RUEDA.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [RUEDA] COMMUNICATIONS TO AND FROM PUERTO
PETROLERO AND BUCARAMANGA HAVE BEEN CUT OFF SINCE EARLY TODAY, AFTER
AN ATTEMPT TO DYNAMITE THE MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE DESTROYED A 100-METER
SECTION OF THE CENTRAL HIGHWAY.

   THE SUPPLY OF GAS TO BUCARAMANGA WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THIS
EVENT. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST 3 DAYS TO RESTORE
NORMAL TRAFFIC, BECAUSE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO USE DYNAMITE TO REMOVE
ROCKS CURRENTLY BLOCKING THE HIGHWAY.

   THE ATTEMPTED SABOTAGE OCCURRED AT THE 65-KM MARK ON THE
BUCARAMANGA - BARRANCABERMEJA HIGHWAY, 20 KM FROM THE PLACE WHERE A
MILITARY CONVOY WAS AMBUSHED LAST WEDNESDAY. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
THAT AN ATTEMPTED SABOTAGE OF THE BUCARAMANGA - BARRANCABERMEJA
MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE, WHICH CARRIES PROPANE GAS, GASOLINE, AND ACPM
[NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] HAS TAKEN PLACE. THE EXPLOSION DESTROYED A
30-METER SECTION OF PIPELINE, AND SPARKED A FIRE THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN
EXTINGUISHED.

   LOSSES CAUSED BY THE SABOTAGE, WHICH HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE
ELN, HAVE YET TO BE ASCERTAINED. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT REPAIRS TO THE
HIGHWAY ALONE WILL COST THE PUBLIC WORKS MINISTRY 5 MILLION PESOS.

   [ISMAEL OROZCO, PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR FOR THE 5TH DISTRICT] WELL,
AFTER INITIAL TALKS WITH ECOPETROL [COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE]
TECHNICIANS TODAY, BEGINNING AT 1700, AFTER THE FIRE IS UNDER CONTROL,

HIS COMPANY $300 MILLION.  WE HAVE THIS REPORT FROM MARIA CLARA
GRACIA.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GRACIA] ECOPETROL HAS LOST 95 BILLION PESOS IN
REVENUES THIS YEAR DUE TO THE 44 TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON -
COVENAS OIL PIPELINE. IN THESE ATTACKS, 13.2 MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE
OIL HAVE BEEN LOST. THE AREAS MOST AFFECTED BY THESE ATTACKS ARE IN
SUCRE, ARAUCA, NORTE DE SANTANDER, AND SANTANDER DEPARTMENTS.

   [REPORTER ALVARO AYALA] DOCTOR, COULD THESE TERRORIST ATTACKS LEAD
TO AN INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES IN COLOMBIA?

   [DR ANDRES RESTREPO LONDONO, PRESIDENT OF ECOPETROL] OBVIOUSLY,
THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN, FACED WITH INCREASING INTERNAL PRODUCTION
COSTS AND FALLING REVENUES, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER
COMPENSATING OUR LOSSES WITH AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC OIL PRICES, BUT
THAT IS A MEASURE WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO ADOPT AT THIS TIME.

   [GRACIA] TODAY'S LANDSLIDE, WHICH DESTROYED A SECTION OF THE
MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE BETWEEN BARRANCABERMEJA AND BUCARAMANGA, HAS
RESULTED IN ESTIMATED LOSSES TOTALLING 1.435 BILLION PESOS. [PASSAGE

HOLOGRAPHIC SURVEYS, WAS REPORTEDLY IN BELIZEAN TERRITORIAL
WATERS--NEAR THE MEDIAN LINE WHERE THE SEA BOUNDARIES OF HONDURAS,
BELIZE AND GUATEMALA MEET--WHEN "A GUATEMALAN GUNBOAT ORDERED THE
SHIP TO STOP." THE INSTRUCTION WAS IGNORED, THE RADIO SAID,
"WHEREUPON THE GUATEMALAN VESSEL FIRED A SHOT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
BRITISH SURVEY VESSEL."

   THE BRITISH DISPATCHED TWO ROYAL AIRFORCE FIGHTER PLANES TO THE
"GENERAL AREA AND ONCE THE BRITISH HARRIERS APPEARED AT THE SITE OF
THE INCIDENT, THE BRITISH COMMUNICATED BY TELEPHONE WITH GUATEMALAN
AUTHORITIES," THE RADIO REPORTED. AGREEMENT WAS REACHED FOR THE
GUATEMALAN VESSEL TO WITHDRAW FROM THE AREA.

   BRITISH AUTHORITIES HAVE TAKEN UP THE MATTER WITH GUATEMALA AND
TRUST THAT GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES WILL TAKE MEASURES TO ENSURE "THAT
AN UNFORTUNATE AND DANGEROUS INCIDENT" WHICH OCCURRED ON SUNDAY
"WILL NOT RECUR," THE RADIO SAID.

   IN EARLY OCTOBER THE GUATEMALAN NAVAL PATROL IN THE SAME GENERAL
AREA IN THE SOUTH OF BELIZE, SEIZED A HONDURAS REGISTERED BOAT ALONG
WITH ITS HONDURAN CREW AND FIVE BELIZEANS INCLUDING FIVE FISHERMEN AND
A MARINE BIOLOGIST WHO WERE CONDUCTING DEEP SEA FISHING RESEARCH IN

GOVERNMENT APPROACHED GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES.  BELIZE PRIME MINISTER
MANUAL ESQUIVEL LATER TOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THE HONDURAN VESSEL
WAS IN GUATEMALAN WATERS WHEN IT WAS SEIZED.

   RELATIONS BETWEEN BELIZE AND GUATEMALA HAVE BEEN STRAINED BY THEIR

   BOGOTA, 17 OCT 88 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE LEFTIST NATIONAL LIBERATION
ARMY (ELN) KIDNAPPED TWO SOLDIERS IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA IN THE PAST FEW
HOURS. THIS BRINGS TO 24 THE NUMBER OF MILITARY MEN HELD BY REBELS.

   ACCORDING TO 2D BRIGADE COMMANDER GENERAL JUAN SALCEDO LORA, THE
SOLDIERS ARE ARTILLERY BATTALION MEMBERS AND WERE KIDNAPPED WHILE
WORKING ON A HIGHWAY IN POPONTE, IN THE NORTHERN CESAR DEPARTMENT.

   MEANWHILE, AN OFFICER AND FOUR POLICEMEN ARE EXPECTED TO BE
RELEASED IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THE FARC KIDNAPPED THESE MEN 6 WEEKS
AGO WHEN THE REBELS ATTACKED MINCA IN THE SIERRA NEVADA DE SANTA MARTA
AREA.

   AN OFFICIAL COMMITTEE, FORMED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FROM THE
NATIONAL REHABILITATION PLAN AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND
MEMBERS OF THE "DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE COMMISSION"--A MULTIPARTY
ORGANIZATION THAT SEARCHES FOR POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TO COLOMBIA'S
PROBLEMS--WAS CONTACTING THE REBELS TODAY TO WORK OUT THE FINAL
DETAILS OF THE FIVE MILITARY MEN'S RELEASE.

   THE REMAINING 17 POLICEMEN--TAKEN BY THE REBELS DURING AN ATTACK ON
NORTHERN SAN PABLO MUNICIPALITY ON 5 OCTOBER--ARE STILL HELD BY THE
REBELS. TALKS FOR THEIR RELEASE HAVE NOT MOVED FORWARD BECAUSE THE
ARMY REFUSES TO ACCEPT THIRD PARTIES AS MEDIATORS.

   CLANDESTINE, 19 OCT 88 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [EXCERPTS] ATTENTION:
THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE URBAN COMMAND HAS BRILLIANTLY SABOTAGED A
COMMERCIAL BUILDING BELONGING TO THE BOURGEOISIE IN THE ESCALON
NEIGHBORHOOD, CAUSING HEAVY ECONOMIC LOSSES TO THE IDLE CLASS. AT
LEAST 37 BUSINESSES WERE DESTROYED.

   THE SAME URBAN COMMAND CARRIED OUT OTHER SABOTAGE AT THE [NAME
INDISTINCT] PARKING LOT--SPECIFICALLY, IN THE PINK ZONE, OR ACTUALLY
IN WHAT SHOULD BE CALLED THE RED ZONE. OTHER SABOTAGE TOOK PLACE AT
THE LANCER MOTEL NEAR APOPA.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE, THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE URBAN COMMAND STATES THAT ON
15 SEPTEMBER, A LENGTHY ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS TO CREATE A NEW
POLITICAL-MILITARY GROUP--IN WHICH 25 DELEGATIONS REPRESENTING
NEIGHBORHOOD COMMANDS PARTICIPATED--ENDED WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE URBAN COMMAND.

   THE COMMUNIQUE WARNS THE ARMY HIGH COMMAND, ITS OFFICERS, CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC AND ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] OFFICIALS, AND
U.S. ADVISERS THAT THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE URBAN COMMAND IS A WEAPON THAT
WILL BE USED AGAINST THEM WHEREVER THEY MAY BE--AT HOME, WORK, AND AT
RECREATION AND CORRUPTION CENTERS. IN ADDITION, THEIR PROPERTY HAS
BEEN DECLARED PERMAMENT MILITARY TARGETS UNTIL THEY STOP THE BLOODSHED
AGAINST THE PEOPLE. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE FMLN'S PEDRO PABLO CASTILLO URBAN
COMMAND EXECUTED AN AIR FORCE OFFICER AS PART OF THE "MURDER THE
CRIMINALS" OPERATION AGAINST REPRESSION, THE MASSACRE IN SAN VICENTE,
AND THE PERSECUTION OF THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY.

   THE EXECUTION OF AN AIR FORCE PILOT OFFICER WAS CARRIED OUT IN SAN
SALVADOR'S LAS BRISAS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE CAN IMAGINE THE HAPPINESS OF
OUR PEOPLE UPON HEARING THE NEWS THAT ONE OF THE CRIMINALS AMONG
CRIMINALS--THAT IS, ONE OF THE PILOTS WHO HAVE BOMBED VILLAGES AND
CANTONS THROUGHOUT OUR FATHERLAND--WAS KILLED AS A RESULT OF
REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE. FROM NOW ON, BOMBS WILL NOT ONLY EXPLODE IN THE
VILLAGES OF CHALATENANGO, CABANAS, USULUTAN, MORAZAN, AND NORTHERN SAN
MIGUEL; MORE POWERFUL BOMBS WILL NOW EXPLODE MORE FREQUENTLY IN THE
ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS, THAT IS, IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF
THE RICH, IN THEIR RECREATION CENTERS, MANSIONS, AND WHEREVER ELSE
THEY MAY GO.

   LIMA, 5 OCT 88 (EL COMERCIO) -- [EXCERPT] HUANCAYO -- TWO ARMY
MEMBERS WERE KILLED AND TWO OTHERS WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE BY A GROUP OF
TERRORISTS WHO THIS MORNING INTERCEPTED TWO BUSES ON THE MARGINAL
HIGHWAY, 30 KM WEST OF SATIPO AND 280 KM NORTHEAST OF HUANCAYO.

   APPROXIMATELY 30 HEAVILY ARMED TERRORISTS, INCLUDING 6 WOMEN,
BLOCKED THE HIGHWAY WITH STONES AND TREE TRUNKS AT 0600 TO INTERCEPT A
BUS OWNED BY THE LOBATO CO., ANOTHER BUS OWNED BY THE LOS ANDES CO.,
AND TWO TRUCKS LOADED WITH FRUIT AND LUMBER. THE VEHICLES WERE
TRAVELING FROM SATIPO TO HUANCAYO.

   THE TERRORISTS MADE THE PASSENGERS GET OFF THE BUSES AND THEN
EXAMINED THEIR IDENTIFICATION CARDS. FOUR OF THE PASSENGERS, WHO
TURNED OUT TO BE ARMY MEMBERS DRESSED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES, WERE
SEPARATED FROM THE GROUP.

   TWO OF THOSE IDENTIFIED AS SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IMMEDIATELY, WHILE
THE OTHER TWO, APPARENTLY ARMY OFFICERS, WERE TAKEN AS HOSTAGES TOWARD
ATALAYA, IN A MONTAINOUS REGION. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   BOGOTA, 24 OCT 88 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO MILITARY SOURCES,
A BLOODY GUERRRILLA OFFENSIVE TODAY LEFT 35 GUERRILLAS AND 5 SOLDIERS
DEAD, 6 CIVILIANS WOUNDED, AND 5 BRIDGES PARTIALLY DESTROYED.

   THE OUTBREAK OF THE VIOLENCE COINCIDED WITH THE REPLY FROM ALL THE
REBEL GROUPS TO AN OFFICIAL PEACE PLAN AND WITH THE CONFIRMATION BY
THE LABOR FEDERATIONS THAT THEY WILL HOLD A GENERAL STRIKE ON THURSDAY
DESPITE GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO PREVENT IT.

   THE SO-CALLED NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNG) PROPOSED
TO PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO THE HOLDING OF A SUMMIT BETWEEN THE REBEL
LEADERS AND THE GOVERNMENT, DEFENSE, AND ENERGY AND MINES MINISTERS AT
A PLACE AND DATE TO BE AGREED UPON.

   THE DOCUMENT PROPOSED THAT THE MEDIATOR OF THE DIALOGUE BE THE
DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE COMMISSION [COMISION DE CONVIVENCIA
DEMOCRATICA], HEADED BY MSGR DARIO CASTRILLON, PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN
AMERICAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE. THE DOCUMENT IS VIEWED AS THE CNG'S
OFFICIAL REPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE PLAN.

   GUERRILLAS OF THE FARC AND THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY (EPL)
ATTACKED FOUR TOWNS IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA, LEAVING 17 GUERRILLAS AND 2
SOLDIERS DEAD AND 3 BRIDGES PARTIALLY DESTROYED.

   THE DEFENSE MINISTRY REPORTED THAT FARC GUERRILLAS AMBUSHED A
MILITARY CONVOY IN HUILA DEPARTMENT, KILLING THREE SOLDIERS. IT ALSO
REPORTED THAT THREE REBELS WERE KILLED IN CLASHES IN SOUTHERN
COLOMBIA.

   IT ADDED THAT NINE GUERRILLAS OF THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION
WERE KILLED IN CLASHES WITH TROOPS OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE ON THE
BORDER OF ANTIOQUIA AND CHOCO DEPARTMENTS AND THAT SIX FARC REBELS
WERE KILLED IN CAQUETA DEPARTMENT.

   SUSPECTED GUERRILLAS DYNAMITED AT DUSK A BRIDGE IN BOGOTA'S URBAN
CENTER, INJURING SIX PEOPLE. THE BRIDGE DID NOT SUSTAIN MAJOR DAMAGE.
ANOTHER BRIDGE WAS BLOWN UP IN SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.

   MILITARY SOURCES SAID THESE WERE REBEL ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE
STRIKE AND THEY CHARGED THAT WORKERS, PEASANTS, AND BUS DRIVERS ARE
BEING THREATENED TO FORCE THEM TO JOIN THE STRIKE.

   PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO HEADED A MEETING OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY
COUNCIL TO ADOPT MEASURES TO PREVENT DISORDERS DURING THE PLANNED
STRIKE AND TO GUARANTEE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FOR THE PEOPLE.

   THE GOVERNMENT AND THE WORKERS YESTERDAY BROKE OFF THEIR TALKS
AFTER BEING UNABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON AN INCREASE OF THE MINIMUM
WAGE AND ON A FREEZE IN THE PRICES OF STAPLES.

   THE STRIKE, CALLED BY THE UNITED WORKERS CONFEDERATION AND THE
GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF LABOR, WILL PROTEST THE FACT THAT THE
GOVERNMENT HAS NOT REPLIED TO LABOR DEMANDS THEY PRESENTED IN MAY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 24 OCT 88 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT BY
ISABEL RUIZ ON STATEMENTS BY NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA)
LEADER SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ] [EXCERPTS] [PASSAGE OMITTED] [OCHOA]
[BEGIN RECORDING] WE ARE FACING AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE CAUSED BY
THE FMLN, WHICH SHOWS ITS MILITARY WEAKNESS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
THE FMLN IS SUPPOSEDLY ATTACKING MILITARY TARGETS, BUT NEITHER A JAIL
NOR A SHOPPING MALL IS A MILITARY TARGET. COMMERCIAL AREAS OR
AMUSEMENT PLACES ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS. CAR BOMBS WENT OFF IN SUCH
PLACES LATELY. THEY WENT OFF AT A CHAIN OF [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND AT A
SHOPPING MALL. THE FMLN'S STRATEGY IS SIMPLY TO INCREASE ITS TERRORIST
ACTIONS.

   FOR THAT REASON, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
DESCRIBES THE FMLN AS A GROUP IN ARMS, BECAUSE THEY ARE MERELY
TERRORIST CRIMINALS. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THERE IS POLITICAL WEAKNESS, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOT GIVEN
CLEAR MISSIONS. WE SEE THE ACTIONS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE
SECURITY CORPS ARE FRUSTRATED, BECAUSE THEY SPEND TIME, EFFORT, AND
MEN CAPTURING TERRORISTS WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASES
THEM FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS.

   I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT MUST APPLY THE LAWS MORE FORCEFULLY AND
STOP DECEIVING THE POPULATION WITH WORDS SUCH AS DEMOCRATIZATION AND
WITH ITS GREAT POLITICAL DEMAGOGY. [END RECORDING]

   FINALLY, OCHOA PEREZ CRITICIZED THE MEETING COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT
OSCAR ARIAS WILL HOLD WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND
TODAY. HE SAID OSCAR ARIAS IS NOT THE RIGHT PERSON TO DEAL WITH
SALVADORAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

   SANTIAGO, 16 OCT 88 (EL MERCURIO) -- [TEXT] THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ
PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR) WILL DEVELOP A NEW FORM OF STRUGGLE CALLED THE
"NATIONAL PATRIOTIC WAR," "WHICH WILL START AT ANY MOMENT."

   THIS INFORMATION WAS DISCLOSED YESTERDAY TO EL MERCURIO BY FPMR
SPOKESMAN VICTOR DIAZ CARO, WHO SAID THAT THE TRUCE DURING THE
PLEBISCITE WAS TO PREPARE THE PHASE THEY ARE NOW STARTING.

   HE ALSO CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT IN BRUSSELS THIS WEEK BY FPMR
INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN MARCELO REYES.

   DIAZ CARO, WHO HAS CONFESSED TO BEING ONE OF THE SNIPERS WHO
PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK ON PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET, IS CURRENTLY
UNDER ARREST IN THE SANTIAGO PRISON, AND, TOGETHER WITH VASILY CARILLO
NOVA, HE IS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN FOR ONE OF THE FACTIONS OF THIS
EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION.

   DIAZ CARO, WHO WAS ARRESTED IN LATE 1986 BY THE POLICE, ANNOUNCED
THAT IN "A MATTER OF HOURS" THEY WILL START SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS. HE
EXPLAINED THAT THIS NEW PHASE OF ARMED STRUGGLE WILL BE CARRIED OUT
"FROM ARICA DOWN TO MAGALLANES."

   AT THE SAME TIME HE REFERRED TO THE RESULTS OF THE PLEBISCITE,
STATING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY RESPECT THOSE WHO VOTED "NO," "THE ONLY
ASPECT OF THE VICTORY OF THE `NO' WE ACCEPT IS THAT PINOCHET LEAVE
POWER."

   IN REFERRING TO THE FPMR'S CHANGE OF STRATEGY, DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED
THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE DURING A MEETING OF THE ORGANIZATION'S
LEADERS LAST APRIL.

   OF THIS OCCASION THEY DISCUSSED THE LINE THAT THE TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION SHOULD FOLLOW. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE IDEA OF
AN "ARMED REBELLION," WHICH PREVAILED UNTIL THEN. THE MAIN
CHARACTERISTIC OF THAT IDEA WAS THAT THE ORGANIZATION SERVED TO
COMPLEMENT CLASS STRUGGLE (AS IT DID IN ITS ORIGIN IN 1983), TO
SUPPORT THE PEOPLE'S REBELLION TO PARALYZE THE COUNTRY AND TO
PERPETRATE ATTACKS AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED REGIME.

   DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY DECIDED TO REPLACE
THE REBELLION WITH THE SEARCH FOR A PATRIOTIC UNITY GOVERNMENT. HE
SAID THAT "WE REALIZE THAT OUSTING THE REGIME IS SUBJECT TO
NEGOTIATIONS UNDER A PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT."

   ACCORDING TO DIAZ CARO THIS IS WHEN THEY REALIZED THE "NEED FOR A
`TRUCE' BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO PLAN GREATER STEPS."

   HE ADDED THAT "THIS IS WHEN WHAT WE CALL THE `NATIONAL PATRIOTIC
WAR' SURFACED. THE MAIN ISSUE OF THIS WAR IS THE ARMED STRUGGLE; WE
ARE NO LONGER A MERE COMPLEMENT TO THE PEOPLE. IT REPRESENTS A
QUALITATIVE STEP FORWARD AND ENTAILS GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES."

   DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT THIS NEW PHASE WILL REQUIRE A GREATER
QUANTITY OF WEAPONS, MORE MEN, AND ALL THE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO
OPERATE. HE SAID THAT THE MONTHS OF TRUCE WERE USED TO FULFILL THESE
NEEDS.

   THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY ALSO DECIDED ON
THE NEED TO ESTABLISH A NON-ISOLATED ACTION.  "WE THOUGHT THAT
ACTIONS IN SANTIAGO, CONCEPCION, AND VALPARAISO WOULD BE THE SOLUTION,
BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE."

   DIAZ CARO EXPLAINED THAT "THIS IS WHY WE NOW REALIZE THAT THE
STRUGGLE SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT FROM ARICA DOWN TO MAGALLANES,
THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY AND IN VARIOUS FORMS." [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 OCT 88 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE AMNESTY
INTERNATIONAL REPORT, WHICH CLAIMS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE INVOLVED
IN THE MURDER OF CERTAIN SALVADORAN CITIZENS?

   [DUARTE] I UNDERSTAND THAT AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HAS TO PREPARE A
REPORT EVERY YEAR, AND THE ORGANIZATION INCLUDES WHATEVER VIEWS IT
CHOOSES IN THE REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION OBVIOUSLY STATES ITS VIEWS IN
THE REPORT.  SALVADORANS DO THINGS ACCORDING TO THE LAW. IF ANY
SALVADORAN OR FOREIGNER HAS EVIDENCE [OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS],
THEN IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURTS.  THAT IS THE LOGICAL AND
LEGAL WAY FOR US TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION; THAT IS WHAT WE ALWAYS DO
IN ALL SUCH CASES.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A SPECIAL
REPORT CLAIMING THAT SOME DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS HAVE DESERTED AND
IMPLICATED SEVERAL RIGHT-WING MEMBERS IN THE MURDER OF MSGR OSCAR
ARNULFO ROMERO AND OTHER SALVADORANS.

   [DUARTE] WE ARE ANALYZING THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN THOSE CASES.
YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY ANALYZED THE CASES. I RELEASED
INFORMATION ONLY WHEN THE EVIDENCE WAS DULY INVESTIGATED AND
CORROBORATED. WE ARE PROCESSING A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION, BUT I
DO NOT WANT TO DISCUSS IT IN DETAIL BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD
HINDER THE INVESTIGATION.

   [REPORTER] IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TWO VIDEO RECORDINGS IN WHICH
THE TWO DESERTERS GIVE THEIR NAMES AND DETAILS AND THAT THESE
RECORDINGS ARE BEING ANALYZED BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND
THE GOVERNMENT?

   [DUARTE] WE ARE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING THE CASE. THAT IS WHY I
SAID THAT I WOULD NOT LIKE TO REVEAL ANY DETAILED INFORMATION--BECAUSE
THIS MIGHT HINDER THE INVESTIGATION.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, THE AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT STATES
THAT DEATH SQUADS--WHICH ARE REPORTEDLY COMPOSED OF SOLDIERS AND
POLICEMEN--ARE BEING REACTIVATED AT A TIME WHEN THE ARMED FORCES
OPPOSE YOUR POLICIES.

   [DUARTE] I DO NOT THINK SO. MY GOVERNMENT'S POLICY REMAINS
UNCHANGED. WE ADVOCATE THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY. I
THINK THIS IS ALWAYS EVIDENT.  EVERY DAY THIS IS DEMONSTRATED BY
EVENTS. [WORDS INDISTINCT] FILM ABOUT GUERRILLA COMMANDERS, WHICH
REPRESENTS SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN AND DISTORTS THE PEOPLE'S VIEWS.
NEVERTHELESS, WE KNOW THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS MUST PREVAIL AND
THEREFORE WE DO NOT INTERVENE. YOU WILL NOT FIND ANOTHER COUNTRY THAT
DOES THIS, YET WE ARE DOING SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD
DEFEND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS ABOVE ALL.

   [REPORTER] HOW MUCH CREDENCE DO YOU GIVE THE AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL
REPORT?

   [DUARTE] THE REPORT IS VALID INSOFAR AS THE FACTS ARE ALL THERE.
HOWEVER, I [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE WAY IN WHICH THE FACTS ARE
INTERPRETED. THE FACTS ARE INTERPRETED ACCORDING TO AMNESTY
INTERNATIONAL'S OWN [WORD INDISTINCT]. WE ALSO RECEIVED REPORTS FROM
RED CROSS INTERNATIONAL [WORDS INDISTINCT] EACH CASE. EACH CASE IS
INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY.  THE UNITED NATIONS HAS ITS OWN OPINION; THE
OAS HAS ITS OWN OPINION. EACH ONE ISSUES A REPORT, AND WE USE THAT
INFORMATION AS THE BASIS FOR OUR INVESTIGATIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS, WHICH IS THE MAIN ISSUE. [END RECORDING]

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 27 OCT 88 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA TODAY RELEASED A PROVISIONAL REPORT ON THE
DAMAGE CAUSED BY HURRICANE JOAN AND ANNOUNCED AN "IMMINENT CONTRA"
ATTACK AGAINST NICARAGUA.

   ACCOMPANIED BY FIVE FSLN NATIONAL DIRECTORATE COMMANDERS--HUMBERTO
ORTEGA, BAYARDO ARCE, VICTOR TIRADO, CARLOS NUNEZ, AND TOMAS
BORGE--AND MEMBERS OF HIS CABINET, ORTEGA ADDRESSED MEMBERS OF THE
DIPLOMATIC CORPS ACCREDITED IN NICARAGUA AND THE FOREIGN PRESS TO
REQUEST MORE INTERNATIONAL AID FOR THE NICARAGUANS AFFECTED BY
HURRICANE JOAN.

   ORTEGA ALSO ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR ITS MEDIATION IN
LIGHT OF A NEW ATTACK BY 3,000 "CONTRAS" WHO, ACCORDING TO ORTEGA,
ARE AT THE HONDURAN BORDER READY TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK AGAINST HIS
PEOPLE "IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME."

   "THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST DEMAND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
FORGET ITS PLAN TO ATTACK NICARAGUA.  THE CONTRAS HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED
BY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AND ARE READY TO ATTACK AT ANY MOMENT,"
THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ADDED.

   "WE KNOW THAT THE REBELS HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO HINDER THE
RECONSTRUCTION WORK THAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY
THE HURRICANE. THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN ORDERED TO SABOTAGE THE COFFEE
HARVEST ACTIVITIES. THE BIGGEST HELP THE YANKEE GOVERNMENT COULD GIVE
THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WOULD BE TO STOP THE ATTACK," THE PRESIDENT
STRESSED.

   ORTEGA ANNOUNCED THAT WHILE HIS COUNTRY WAS BEING HIT BY HURRICANE
JOAN, THE CONTRAS CARRIED OUT ATTACKS AND KILLED FIVE CIVILIANS.

   REGARDING THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE HURRICANE, ORTEGA SAID THAT THIS
COMING WEEK, AN ECLA TEAM WILL ARRIVE IN MANAGUA TO MAKE "FINAL"
EVALUATIONS ON THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY JOAN LAST WEEK.

   INTERNATIONAL AID "IS NECESSARY AND URGENT BECAUSE THE SITUATION
IS CHAOTIC," ORTEGA ADDED, STRESSING THE ROLE PLAYED BY CUBA IN
HELPING HIS PEOPLE.

   HE SAID THAT CUBA SENT 24 PLANES TO NICARAGUA WITH FOOD, MEDICINE,
AND MEDICAL TEAMS; MEXICO SENT 2 PLANES; AND SPAIN, GREAT BRITAIN,
PANAMA, AND BELGIUM EACH SENT ONE; FOR A TOTAL OF 2,052 TONS OF AID.

   GIVING A PROVISIONAL REPORT ON THE DAMAGE, ORTEGA SAID THERE WERE
116 DEAD, 178 INJURED, 110 MISSING, AND 29,152 HOUSES DESTROYED AS
WELL AS DAMAGE TO AGRICULTURE AND FISHING.

   HE STRESSED THE DAMAGE TO THE ECOLOGY BECAUSE THOUSANDS OF HECTARES
OF FOREST WERE DESTROYED. HE SAID THAT EUROPEAN TECHNICIANS WILL
TRAVEL TO NICARAGUA NEXT WEEK TO EVALUATE THE DAMAGE.

   ORTEGA SAID THAT TO FACE THE HURRICANE, THE COUNTRY USED THE
DEFENSE SYSTEM IT WOULD USE TO REPEL A MILITARY ATTACK AND THAT THANKS
TO THIS, MANY HUMAN LIVES WERE SAVED.

   BOGOTA, 29 OCT 88 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [REPORT ON
NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO BY UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTERS FOLLOWING CONCLUSION OF GROUP OF EIGHT MEETING IN PUNTA DEL
ESTE, URUGUAY]

   [TEXT] THE SECOND MEETING OF THE SO-CALLED GROUP OF EIGHT CONCLUDED
TODAY IN PUNTA DEL ESTE, URUGUAY. AFTER THE URUGUAY DECLARATION WAS
SIGNED, THE PRESIDENTS HOSTED A NEWS CONFERENCE. COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT
VIRGILIO BARCO ANSWERED A URUGUAYAN JOURNALIST'S QUESTION ON THE
CURRENT SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] THE SITUATION IN YOUR COUNTRY IS VERY
SERIOUS. THOUSANDS ARE DEAD, PARAMILITARY DEATH SQUADS GO UNPUNISHED
DESPITE THEIR MURDERS OF PATRIOTIC UNION [UP] MEMBERS AND POPULARLY
ELECTED LEGISLATORS. MR PRESIDENT, HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS SITUATION
AND HOW CAN YOU RECONCILE THE SITUATION EXISTING IN YOUR COUNTRY WITH
YOUR AFFIRMATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRACY? THANK YOU.

   [BARCO] I DO NOT BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS RELEVANT TO THE
COMPOSITION AND PURPOSE OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEETING.  THE QUESTION
ARISES FROM A LACK OF INFORMATION. COLOMBIA IS A DEMOCRACY, SUPPORTED
BY A PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES.  THE SOLDIERS ARE COLOMBIANS WHO ARE
COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE. THEY ARE
YOUTHS FROM ALL GROUPS, FROM THE RURAL AREAS, THE CITIES, AND FROM ALL
POLITICAL PARTIES. THE OFFICERS ARE PROFESSIONALS, AND THEY DO NOT
FOLLOW MILITARIST DOCTRINES.

   THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED--MAY I ADD ON AN
INDIVIDUAL AND PERSONAL BASIS--IN ANY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE
UNDER INVESTIGATION, WILL BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE A MILITARY COURT, AND
MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXPELLED. CIVIL COURTS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF
SOME OF THOSE CRIMES, AND SOME ARREST WARRANTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED.
MILITARY JUSTICE AUTHORITIES ARE ALSO CONDUCTING LEGAL ACTIONS. [END
RECORDING]

   DURING THE SAME NEWS CONFERENCE THIS MORNING, PRESIDENT BARCO
NOTIFIED JOURNALISTS THAT LAST THURSDAY'S STRIKE HAD BEEN AN ATTEMPT
BY ARMED REBEL GROUPS AGAINST DEMOCRACY. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PRESS
CENSORSHIP DECREE WAS NO LONGER VALID.

   SAN SALVADOR, 11 NOV 88 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [REPORT] [ELMER
GOMEZ] [TEXT] [GOMEZ] PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE CALLED ON THE
COUNTRY'S POLITICAL PARTIES THAT WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE UPCOMING
ELECTIONS TO PROTECT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THE REPUBLIC. DUARTE
MADE THIS CALL DURING HIS SPEECH OPENING THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL FAIR
OF EL SALVADOR, IN WHICH 25 COUNTRIES ARE PARTICIPATING.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PEACE LOVER, AND
THAT IS WHY IT GRIEVES ME TO SEE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CURRENT
SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND CRISIS. I, HOWEVER, BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS WILL BE STRENGTHENED. I BELIEVE THE MINDS OF MEN WILL BE
TRANSFORMED POSITIVELY, AND IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLES--EVEN THE MOST
POLARIZED ONES--WILL BE DEFINITELY SOLVED BY THE CIVILIZED MEANS OF
THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.

   I CALL ON ALL POLITICAL PARTIES TO STRENGTHEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL
PROCESS AND PUT THE SACRED INTERESTS OF THE NATION BEFORE ANY OTHER
INTERESTS BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT THE REPUBLIC AND
CONSOLIDATE THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION THAT BELONGS TO ALL SALVADORANS.

   I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A CALL TO ALL GROUPS SO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS,
WHICH WILL CULMINATE WITH THE ELECTION OF A NEW PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR,
DEVELOPS WITH THE SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR THAT CORRESPONDS TO COURAGEOUS
PEOPLE, WHO WISH TO SHOW THE WORLD THEIR POLITICAL MATURITY AND THEIR
DESIRE TO LIVE IN PEACE.

   THE ELECTORAL PROCESS WILL SLOWLY CONSOLIDATE. I BELIEVE SOONER
THAN LATER, GOOD JUDGEMENT WILL PREVAIL IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE
BEEN DRIVEN MAD BY BARBARISM. [END RECORDING]

   [GOMEZ] PRESIDENT DUARTE ALSO SAID THE FMLN WILL NOT STOP THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THAT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION IS DIFFERENT FROM
THE ONE PRESENTED BY FMLN COMMANDERS JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS AND LEONEL
GONZALEZ DURING THEIR LATIN AMERICAN TOUR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] IT IS TRUE THAT THE ENEMIES OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL GO ON CONDUCTING THEIR TERRORIST AND
DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS. THOSE ACTIONS, HOWEVER, WILL NOT AT ALL AFFECT
THE PROGRESS MADE BY OUR DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLE. THE TRUTH IS THAT OUR
CRISIS IS AS LARGE AS THE EFFORT WE HAVE MADE TO FACE IT. THAT EFFORT
GOES BEYOND OUR BORDERS AND REACHES THE ENTIRE WORLD.

   THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGES THAT BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE IN EL
SALVADOR ARE [WORD INDISTINCT] AND HAVE BEGAN TO SHOW THEIR RESULTS,
DESPITE THE DESPERATE ACTIONS THE FMLN-FDR IS CONDUCTING ABROAD IN
ORDER TO COUNTER THE RESULTS OF THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE.

   THE FOREIGNERS WHO CAME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS FAIR AS WELL AS THE
DISTINGUISHED OAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATES WILL CONFIRM THAT THE
SALVADORAN SITUATION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT CIRCULATED ABROAD AND
DISSEMINATED AS PART OF AN FMLN -FDR DISINFORMATION PLAN.

   THE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR LOCAL SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS HAVE SAID
ABROAD THAT THERE IS REPRESSION IN EL SALVADOR.  ONLY A GOVERNMENT
THAT IMPOSES ITSELF BY FORCE ON ITS PEOPLE CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A
REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT. OUR COUNTRY NEVER ENJOYED SO MUCH FREEDOM AS
NOW AND ITS RULERS WERE NEVER CHOSEN SO FREELY AS THEY ARE NOW. [END
RECORDING]

   [GOMEZ] [WORD INDISTINCT] PRESIDENT DUARTE SAID THE 18TH OAS
REGULAR MEETING REPRESENTS THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES' SUPPORT FOR
THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   BERLIN (FRG), 6 NOV 88 (ADN/ND) -- [TEXT] AT A NEWS CONFERENCE IN
BERLIN ON FRIDAY [4 NOVEMBER], VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, MEMBER OF THE
POLITICAL COMMISSION AND SECRETARIAT OF THE PCCH CENTRAL COMMITTEE,
GAVE A REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN CHILE FOLLOWING THE REFERENDUM. HE
SAID THAT THE PEOPLE'S RESOLUTE "NO" IN THE REFERENDUM ON 5 OCTOBER
MUST NOW BE FOLLOWED BY THE OVERTHROW OF PINOCHET AND THE RETURN TO
DEMOCRACY. THE FORMER SENATOR SAID THAT THE MOST URGENT CONDITION FOR
THE PATH INTO THE FUTURE IS THE CREATION OF A BROAD UNITY OF ALL
OPPOSITION FORCES WHICH CAN WIN A VICTORY OVER PINOCHET. HE SAID THAT
THE COMMUNIST PARTY ALSO CONSIDERS COOPERATION, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE
SOCIALISTS, A DECISIVE STEP.

   HE SAID THAT QUITE A FEW THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN CHILE THROUGH THE
BROAD MASS MOVEMENT. HIGH OFFICERS WHO SERVED THE DICTATOR MOST
LOYALLY HAVE HAD TO RESIGN NOW UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC
PUBLIC. IN ADDITION, IT HAS JUST BEEN REPORTED THAT EL SIGLO, THE
COMMUNIST PARTY NEWSPAPER, WILL BE PUBLISHED AGAIN LEGALLY.

   ASKED ABOUT THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF THE STRUGGLE, TEITELBOIM SAID
THAT THE PROGRESSIVE FORCES IN CHILE, WHO HAD TO PAY A HIGH PRICE FOR
THEIR RESISTANCE IN THE PINOCHET'S 15-YEAR RULE, CONTINUE TO BE
EXPOSED TO PERSECUTION, IMPRISONMENT, AND THREATS OF MURDER. THE
COMMUNIST PARTY, WHICH HAS HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CASUALTIES AND
MISSING AND TORTURED PEOPLE SINCE THE DICTATORSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED,
CONTINUES TO BE BANNED.

   NONETHELESS, THE COUNTRY IS CAUGHT UP IN A WAVE OF MOBILIZATION OF
THE PEOPLE. VOLODIA TEITELBOIM CONFIRMED THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY
SUPPORTS THE DEMAND MADE BY THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE TO HOLD THE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS PROMISED BY THE MILITARY JUNTA FOR LATE 1989 AT
AN EARLIER DATE, AND TO NOMINATE A COMMON PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. IN
ADDITION, THE CONSTITUTION--ON THE BASIS OF WHICH PINOCHET INTENDS TO
CONTINUE IN OFFICE UNTIL MARCH 1990 DESPITE HIS DEFEAT THROUGH THE
REFERENDUM--MUST BE ABOLISHED TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE ON THE
COUNTRY'S FUTURE IN FREEDOM.

   VOLODIA TEITELBOIM PAID TRIBUTE TO THE GDR'S CONSISTENT POSITION IN
WORD AND DEED AS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WITH THE
CHILEAN PEOPLE. HE SAID THAT HUNDREDS OF PATRIOTS FROM HIS COUNTRY
HAVE FOUND A TEMPORARY HOME IN THE GDR, WHERE THEY CAN LIVE AND WORK.

MILITARY REGIME BY "ALL FORMS OF STRUGGLE." THE MIR REJECTED THE
STRATEGY OF DIALOGUE ADVOCATED BY THE OPPOSITION'S DEMOCRATIC SECTORS.

   THE MIR ADDED THAT IT WILL "TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY SITUATION" AND
THAT IT WILL USE THE ELECTORAL PROCESS BY REGISTERING A LEFTIST PARTY.

   MIR SPOKESMAN JECAR NEGHME TALKED TO THE PRESS YESTERDAY ABOUT THE
RESOLUTIONS APPROVED AT THE LATEST MIR CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING HELD
ON 6 AND 7 NOVEMBER.  HE SAID THAT IT WAS THE FIRST MEETING HELD IN
CHILE SINCE JULY 1973.

   NEGHME STATED THAT IN ADDITION TO POLITICAL ISSUES, THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE ALSO PAID HOMAGE TO RAUL PELLEGRIN AND CECILIA MAGNI,
MEMBERS OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT WHO WERE KILLED
RECENTLY.

   IN A PUBLIC COMMUNIQUE, THE MIR CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION PARTIES
FOR "NOT LISTENING TO THE NATIONAL CLAMOR FOR PINOCHET'S
RESIGNATION" AND FOR GIVING PRIORITY TO "A STRATEGY OF SHADY DEALS
AT THE TOP LEVEL."

   THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS: "ALTHOUGH THE DOCUMENT RELEASED BY THE 16
POLITICAL PARTIES FOCUSES ON SOME OF THE PEOPLE'S DEMANDS, ITS MAIN
DEFECT IS THAT BY INCLUDING THE DEMANDS AS PART OF A NEGOTIATING
STRATEGY AND BY MAKING THE MOBILIZATION TASKS UNCLEAR, THE DEMANDS OF
THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WILL NOT BE HEARD."

   THE MIR ALSO SAID THAT NEXT YEAR IT WILL STRUGGLE FOR THE IMMEDIATE
END OF THE REGIME AND THE CONSTITUTION, THE CREATION OF A PROVISIONAL
GOVERNMENT, THE ELECTION OF A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, THE STRENGTHENING
OF THE UNITED LEFT, AND THE PREPARATION OF A "DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR
PROGRAM" FOR THE COUNTRY.

   THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THE MIR WILL
PROMOTE A TACTIC "TO DESTABILIZE THE REGIME, TO MAKE THE INSTITUTIONS
ILLEGITIMATE, TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY, AND TO ACCUMULATE GREATER
FORCE."

   THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THE MIR WILL USE "THE LIMITED
POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN ELECTIONS BEGINNING IN 1988." THIS IS
WHY THE MIR SUPPORTS THE REGISTRATION OF A LEFTIST PARTY: TO PREVENT
THE EXCLUSION OF THE LEFT AND "TO PROMOTE THE GAINS OF THE PEOPLE."

   QUITO, 27 NOV 88 (VOZ DE LOS ANDES) -- [TEXT] GOVERNMENT MINISTER
ANDRES VALLEJO YESTERDAY AGAIN DENIED THE CLAIM OF COMMANDERS JOAQUIN
AND JAVIER OF THE ALFARO LIVES DAMMIT SUBVERSIVE GROUP THAT THEY HAVE
MET WITH HIM. THE REBEL LEADERS MAINTAIN THEY HAVE MET ON FIVE
OCCASIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF CONSULTATIONS AND
COORDINATION PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA. ACCORDING TO THEM,
ONE OF THE MEETINGS INVOLVED MINISTER VALLEJO HIMSELF, WHO REPORTEDLY
INTRODUCED THEM TO A DELEGATE OF PRESIDENT BORJA FOR FURTHER TALKS.

   NEVERTHELESS, VALLEJO DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING
TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE COUNTRY.
FEBRES-CORDERO'S ADMINISTRATION REFUSED TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE ALFARO
LIVES DAMMIT AND FREE HOMELAND MONTONERAS GUERRILLA GROUPS BECAUSE IT
CONSIDERED THEM TO BE TERRORIST GROUPS; IT ACTUALLY ATTACKED THESE
GROUPS TO THE POINT OF ALMOST ELIMINATING THEM.

   VALLEJO POINTED OUT THAT HOLDING TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS WOULD BE
A POSITIVE STEP. HE RECALLED THAT THE COLOMBIAN ADMINISTRATION OF
BELISARIO BETANCUR BEGAN A DIALOGUE WITH GENUINE REVOLUTIONARY ARMIES
TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THAT COUNTRY. HE ASKED: WHY CAN WE NOT HOLD TALKS
HERE, WHERE THE GUERRILLAS ARE STILL AT AN EMBRYONIC PHASE?

   THE POSSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT-GUERRILLAS TALKS HAS BEEN VIEWED
DIFFERENTLY. NATIONAL CONGRESS PRESIDENT WILFRIDO LUCERO SAID ON 25
NOVEMBER THAT THE CONGRESS IS NEITHER TASKED NOR EMPOWERED TO HOLD
TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS. LUCERO REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE ALLEGED
TALKS, SAYING THAT HE HAS RECEIVED NO INFORMATION IN THIS REGARD. HE
ADDED: THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF OTHERS;
IT IS NOT A CONCERN OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS.

   ACCORDING TO JULIO CESAR TRUJILLO, A FORMER PRESIDENT OF POPULAR
DEMOCRACY, TALKS WITH GUERRILLAS WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE
THEY HAVE USEFUL IDEAS, SOME OF WHICH COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. HE ADDED
THAT NOT EVERYTHING ADVOCATED BY THE GUERRILLAS CAN BE CARRIED OUT
BECAUSE THERE ARE OBSTACLES FACING THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE CURRENT
RULERS.

   MEANWHILE, THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY OF FORMER PRESIDENT LEON
FEBRES-CORDERO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THIS POSSIBILITY. IT WILL MEET
TOMORROW TO DISCUSS THE TOPIC AND ISSUE AN STATEMENT. MARCO LARA,
PRESIDENT OF THAT PARTY AND PUBLIC INFORMATION SECRETARY DURING THE
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THIS.

   WHILE IN QUITO [AS HEARD], COMMANDERS JOAQUIN AND JAVIER ARE
PROPOSING A BROAD AND DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH RODRIGO BORJA'S REGIME; IN
GUAYAQUIL, LEADERS JUAN CUBIA AND EDGAR PRIAS, BOTH IN PRISON, AND
PATRICIO BAQUERIZO ARE REJECTING A DEMAND THAT THE MOVEMENT RESPECT
THE LAW.

   BOGOTA, 28 NOV 88 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [REPORT]
[MARIA CLARA GRACIA] [TEXT] IN VENEZUELA, AUTOPSIES HAVE BEEN
PERFORMED ON 9 OF THE 14 FISHERMEN--INCLUDING 2 COLOMBIANS--KILLED IN
EL AMPARO. THE AUTOPSY REPORTS ARE BEING WIDELY DISCUSSED.  THE
INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY
INVOLVE THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES.

   COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTER JULIO LONDONO PAREDES HAS REQUESTED
COORDINATED ACTIONS BY THE TWO COUNTRIES TO PREVENT SUCH BORDER
INCIDENTS.

   IT WAS ADMITTED THAT THE REMAINS OF THE FISHERMEN WERE EXHUMED OVER
THE WEEKEND. SEVEN OF THEM WERE EXHUMED ON 26 NOVEMBER AND SIX ON 27
NOVEMBER IN VENEZUELA. THE JUDICIAL REPORT STATED THAT THERE WERE NO
GUERRILLA CLASHES AND THAT EACH WAS KILLED BY A COUP DE GRACE OF THE
VENEZUELAN ARMY.

   THE VENEZUELAN INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION ENTRUSTED WITH CLARIFYING
THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY AUTHORITIES' REASONS FOR SLAUGHTERING 14
FISHERMEN ON 22 OCTOBER IN EL AMPARO DIRECTLY INVOLVE THE SECURITY
ORGANIZATIONS.

   THE AUTOPSIES PERFORMED ON NINE BODIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT THE
PEASANTS OF THE BORDER AREA DID NOT HAVE AN ARMED CLASH WITH THE
MILITARY. ON THE CONTRARY, THEY WERE SHOT AT A DISTANCE LESS THAN 1
METER, WHICH IS WHAT THE TWO SURVIVORS SAID FROM THE BEGINNING. THOSE
SURVIVORS HAVE NOW REQUESTED ASYLUM IN CARACAS FROM THE MEXICAN
GOVERNMENT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LONDONO] WE HOPE SUCH INCIDENTS WILL DECREASE
AND THAT THE VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES ALONG THE BORDER WILL COORDINATE
WITH THE COLOMBIAN CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES ANY ACTIONS FOR
PRESERVING--NOT ONLY THE LIVES OF THE COLOMBIANS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE
BORDER--PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY IN THE BORDER AREA. [END RECORDING]

   BECAUSE 2 OF THE 14 MURDERED FISHERMEN WERE COLOMBIANS, LONDONO
PAREDES STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL MAINTAIN ITS INITIAL STAND OF
DEMANDING COMPENSATION FOR THE RELATIVES OF THE DEAD COLOMBIANS. THE
GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO AWAIT AN OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION FROM VENEZUELA ON
THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS ON THE EL AMPARO SLAUGHTER.

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 88 (TCS TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [ROBERTO
REPRESA] [TEXT] COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS, COMMANDER OF THE
ARMY'S 3D BRIGADE IN SAN MIGUEL, HAS STATED THAT THE ARMED FORCES IS
NOT INVOLVED IN DEATH SQUAD ACTIONS AND THAT SUCH ACTIONS ARE CONTRARY
TO THE INSTITUTION'S REGULATIONS. VARGAS WAS REFERRING SPECIFICALLY TO
THE MURDER OF THREE PEASANTS IN MORAZAN, OF WHICH THE ARMY IS BEING
ACCUSED:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VARGAS] OUR VALUES AND THE VALUES OF THE SYSTEM
WE DEFEND DO NOT ALLOW US TO EXECUTE, KIDNAP, OR STEAL. THE SYSTEM
STATES WE ARE TO COMPLY WITH OUR LAWS AND LET THE RESPONSIBLE
INSTITUTIONS DETERMINE GUILT OR INNOCENCE. WE CANNOT BE JUDGE AND JURY
IN SUCH SITUATIONS.  [END RECORDING]

   THE MOST RECENT CASE FOR WHICH THE ARMY IS BEING BLAMED IS THE
MURDER OF THREE PEASANTS IN YAMABAL CANTON, MORAZAN, ON 12 NOVEMBER.
VARGAS DENIED ARMED FORCES COMPLICITY IN THESE MURDERS AND STATED THAT
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS MUST INVESTIGATE IN CASES OF THIS NATURE SO
THEY CAN PRESENT EVIDENCE AND ACCUSE A SPECIFIC SECTOR. HE ADDED THAT
HE HAS EVIDENCE THE ARMY WAS NOT PRESENT IN YAMABAL CANTON ON THE DAY
OF THE TRIPLE MURDER:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VARGAS] I DIRECTLY ACCUSE THE FMLN AND TELL THE
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ACCUSING THE ARMED FORCES TO
INVESTIGATE THE FMLN. THE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS MUST NOT ACCEPT
DIALECTIC CONCLUSIONS SUCH AS THE ONES MADE BY THE CRIMINAL JOAQUIN
VILLALOBOS, WHO SAID WE EXECUTED AND [WORDS INDISTINCT]. THEY ARE NOT
GOD. THEY TALK AS IF THE WORLD BELONGED TO THEM.  THERE ARE LAWS AND A
LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN THIS COUNTRY.  OUR SYSTEM HAS A LEGAL FRAMEWORK,
AND WE HAVE TO BASE OURSELVES ON IT. THERE ARE HUMANITARIAN
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BECOME CORRUPT AND HAVE BECOME ACCOMPLICES OF
THE FMLN'S MURDER; THEY REMAIN SILENT AND DO NOT DEFEND JUSTICE, LAWS,
AND PRINCIPLES. REGARDING THIS CASE, I ACCUSE THE FMLN OF THESE
DEATHS. WE HAVE EVIDENCE THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTS
PRESENTLY BEING REPORTED IN THE NORTHWESTERN ZONE. [END RECORDING]

   COL VARGAS ALSO CRITICIZED THE WORK DONE BY SOME HUMANITARIAN
ORGNIZATIONS AND SAID THEY USE HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN EXCUSE TO PROTECT
SECTORS THAT SHARE THEIR IDEOLOGY.

   LIMA, 31 OCT 88 (EFE) -- [TEXT] TWENTY-SIX PEOPLE, FOUR OF WHOM ARE
POLICEMEN, WERE INJURED IN A BOMB EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED BEFORE DAWN
ON 30 OCTOBER. THE BOMB WAS PLACED IN A DANCE HALL IN AYACUCHO, A CITY
LOCATED SOUTH OF LIMA.

   THE LOCAL PRESS TODAY REPORTED THAT THE POLICE HAVE ATTRIBUTED THE
ATTACK TO TERRORISTS WHO USED A HOME-MADE BOMB CALLED "RUSSIAN
CHEESE." THIS BOMB IS MADE UP OF POWDER, TACKS, PIECES OF IRON, AND
STEEL WIRE. IT EXPLODES WHEN IT TOUCHES THE FLOOR.

   AYACUCHO WAS THE SITE OF A SIMILAR EXPLOSION ON 3 JULY WHEN SEVERAL
UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE HURLED EXPLOSIVES AT A DANCE HALL WHERE THE MUSIC
GROUP "LOS SHAPIS" WAS PLAYING. THE "LOS SHAPIS" MUSIC GROUP HAS
RECEIVED DEATH THREATS FROM THE "SHINING PATH" GUERRILLA GROUP
BECAUSE THE LATTER BELIEVES "LOS SHAPIS" PLAY ALIENATING MUSIC.

   ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, THE "SHINING PATH," WHICH BEGAN ITS
ACTIVITIES IN AYACUCHO IN MAY 1980, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF
ABOUT 12,000 PEOPLE AND MATERIAL LOSSES ESTIMATED AT $10 BILLION.

   LIMA, 28 OCT 88 (EFE) -- [TEXT] EEC AND ANDEAN GROUP OFFICIALS HAVE
HELD MEETINGS AT THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD HEADQUARTERS TO PROGRAM
ACTIVITIES AIMED AT INCREASING TRADE TIES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS.

   ACCORDING TO WHAT THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD, A
TECHNICAL-COMMUNITY INTEGRATION ORGANIZATION, REPORTED TODAY, THE
POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT WERE ADOPTED BY THE ANDEAN-EUROPEAN JOINT
COMMISSION IN THE MEETINGS HELD IN BRUSSELS IN APRIL ARE NOW BEING
IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE HOLDING OF THESE TALKS.

   THE FIRST MEETING IN LIMA WILL BE TO DISCUSS FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES
SUCH AS THE BETTER USE OF THE GENERALIZED PREFERENTIAL RATES SYSTEM
THAT IS IMPLEMENTED BY THE EEC, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ACTIVITIES TO
PROMOTE TRADE, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANDEAN EXPORTS.

   THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE AGREEMENTS NOT ONLY ENCOMPASS THE
STRENGTHENING OF TRADE TIES, BUT ALSO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND
ECONOMIC COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT.

   PETER HEISLER, THE CHIEF OF THE EEC DELEGATION, SAID THAT THIS
MEETING SHOWS "OUR WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE."

   ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PROVIDED BY THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD,
IN 1986 THE ANDEAN GROUP, COMPRISED OF BOLIVIA, ECUADOR, COLOMBIA,
PERU, AND VENEZUELA, RECORDED A DEFICIT OF $266 MILLION IN ITS TRADE
WITH EEC COUNTRIES.

   THIS DEFICIT IN ANDEAN TRADE, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED SINCE
1982, WHEN THE FOREIGN DEBT CRISIS EXPLODED IN ANDEAN GROUP COUNTRIES,
IS CAUSED BY THE FALL BY ALMOST 23 PERCENT OF ANDEAN EXPORTS, WHICH IN
1988 TOTALED $3.847 BILLION.

   THIS DEFICIT IS ALSO CAUSED BY AN INCREASE OF 18 PERCENT IN ANDEAN
IMPORTS FROM EEC COUNTRIES, WORTH $4.113 BILLION.

   BETWEEN 1970 AND 1986, THE ANDEAN GROUP ACCUMULATED A TRADE DEFICIT
OF $2.175 BILLION WITH THE GROUP OF 12.

   DURING THIS PERIOD, ANDEAN EXPORTS TOTALED $54.795 BILLION, WHILE
IMPORTS TOTALED $56.970 BILLION.

   THE COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD
MEMBERS AND EEC COUNTRIES WAS SIGNED ON 17 DECEMBER 1983 IN CARTAGENA,
COLOMBIA.

   LATER, THE CONGRESSES OF ALL THE COUNTRIES COMPRISING THE ANDEAN
GROUP APPROVED THE AGREEMENT WHILE NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THEM,
PARTICULARLY REGARDING TRADE, HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE SINCE APRIL 1988.

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 NOV 88 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
NATIONAL POLICE DIRECTOR COLONEL CARLOS MAURICIO GUZMAN AGUILAR AT
NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS, SAN SALVADOR, BY AN UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTER] [EXCERPTS] [BEGIN RECORDING] [GUZMAN] I HAVE BEEN WORKING
JOINTLY WITH THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF--NOT JUST THIS WEEK BUT
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. I HAVE TO ADD THAT NOT ONLY THE NATIONAL POLICE
ARE INVOLVED, BUT THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES AND THE MILITARY CORPS
STATIONED HERE IN SAN SALVADOR. WE HAVE REINFORCEMENTS FROM THE
COUNTRYSIDE AND ARE WORKING ON A JOINT PLAN TO HELP MINIMIZE TERRORIST
ATTACKS THAT THEY WILL TRY TO CARRY OUT AND ARE CARRYING OUT AT THIS
VERY MOMENT.

   JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR A
DEMONSTRATION THAT IS TO BEGIN AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.  THERE WILL
BE STUDENTS TOGETHER WITH UNTS [NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS]
MEMBERS, WHO ARE GOING TO MARCH THEIR USUAL ROUTE AND END UP AT THE
PARK ACROSS FROM THE CATHEDRAL.

   I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS AS
LONG AS THEY OBEY THE LAW. AS I SAID A FEW DAYS AGO, WE DO NOT WANT
CONFRONTATIONS WITH ANYONE.  WHAT THEY WANT IS TO CONFRONT POLICE AND
PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES FOR THE SAKE OF CREATING A MARTYR, AND WE ARE
UNWILLING TO OBLIGE THEM IN THIS ENDEAVOR. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   [REPORTER] THE ATTACK AGAINST THE NATIONAL GUARD SEEMS LIKE A
CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE SECURITY CORPS. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE
NATIONAL POLICE ARE ON ALERT FOR AN ATTACK IN VIEW OF THE ATTACKS
AGAINST THE NATIONAL GUARD AND THE TREASURY POLICE?

   [GUZMAN] AS I SAID BEFORE, THIS IS NOT NEW FOR US, AND WE ARE
MAKING PLANS. YOU NOTICE THAT THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS IS CLOSE TO
HOMES. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN USULUTAN AND IN SAN FRANCISCO MORAZAN
WHERE THESE PEOPLE ATTACKED WITHOUT CARING WHETHER THEY DESTROYED
PRIVATE PROPERTY OR HOMES--EVEN KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS. WE ARE NOT
EXEMPT FROM THIS HERE. WE HAVE A STRATEGY. WE EVEN BELIEVE THERE IS A
POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTACK FROM INSIDE THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS--IT IS
VERY POSSIBLE, THEY HAVE DONE IT BEFORE. I REMEMBER WHEN THEY BOMBED
THE SERVICE STATION HERE, DESTROYING THREE OR FOUR VEHICLES, AND THEY
ALSO PLACED BOMBS INSIDE THE GENERAL DIRECTORATE OFFICE. WE ARE DOING
ALL WE CAN TO TRY TO AVOID THESE PROBLEMS. WE ARE READY TO FACE ANY
SITUATION. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   [REPORTER] WHAT PLANS HAVE YOU MADE FOR THE UPCOMING OAS GENERAL
MEETING, AND WHAT SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES WILL THE NATIONAL POLICE
HAVE IN REGARD TO THIS MEETING?

   [GUZMAN] YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THESE ARE MAINLY MILITARY PLANS WHICH
WE CANNOT VERY WELL DISCLOSE IN ADVANCE.  IF I STARTED GIVING OUT THIS
INFORMATION, I WOULD BE EXPOSING OUR SECURITY OPERATION FOR THE
MEETING. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WE ARE TAKING THIS SITUATION VERY
SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE REINFORCEMENTS FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE. NOT ONLY IS
THE NATIONAL POLICE INVOLVED, BUT THE PUBLIC SECURITY CORPS, AS WELL
AS OTHER UNITS THAT HAVE COME FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE TO SUPPORT THIS
COMMON EFFORT. [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 NOV 88 (TCS TELEVISION) -- [INTERVIEW WITH DEFENSE
MINISTER GENERAL CARLOS VIDES CASANOVA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS]

   [EXCERPTS] [REPORTER] DEAR LISTENERS, THE MINISTER HAS ARRIVED AND
WE WELCOME HIM AND THANK HIM FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN THIS SEGMENT.
GOOD MORNING.

   [VIDES] GOOD MORNING.

   [REPORTER] VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED RECENTLY AND THE PEOPLE ARE
EXTREMELY WORRIED. WHAT ARE THE ARMED FORCES DOING TO GUARANTEE THE
PEOPLE'S WELFARE?

   [VIDES] THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S CONCERN ABOUT INCREASED TERRORIST
VIOLENCE IS UNDERSTANDABLE. WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT TERRORIST ACTS
ALWAYS ESCALATE WHEN IMPORTANT EVENTS ARE EXPECTED. THIS DOES NOT
HAPPEN ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY; WE RECENTLY SAW IT IN SEOUL, BEFORE THE
OLYMPICS, WHEN GROUPS RESORTED TO VIOLENCE TO PROVOKE THE AUTHORITIES
AND PREVENT AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT FROM TAKING PLACE.

   AN OAS MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY IN A FEW
DAYS. THE EVENT IS BEING THREATENED BY A NUMBER OF ACTS, PARTICULARLY
TERRORIST ACTS IN THE SAN BENITO, MAX DIAZ, ESCALON, AND SAN FRANCISCO
NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WILL PROTEST AGAINST
THE OAS MEETING IF THEY CAUSE TERROR IN THOSE AREAS.

   WE ARE EXPECTING FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM LATIN AMERICA, CENTRAL
AMERICA, AND THE UNITED STATES, WHOM THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE WILL CALL
OFF THE MEETING BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. THAT IS THE
MAIN REASON FOR THE INCREASED VIOLENCE.

   YOU HAVE SEEN THAT WE HAVE INCREASED PATROL OPERATIONS RECENTLY.
PATROLS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT AROUND THE VOLCANOES NEAR SAN
SALVADOR. SECURITY MEASURES ARE ALSO BEING IMPLEMENTED ON THE
PERIPHERY OF SAN SALVADOR AND AROUND THE MEETING VENUE, BUT I CANNOT
GIVE YOU THE DETAILS. THERE IS ALSO A COMPLETE SECURITY PLAN FOR THE
OFFICIALS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE OAS MEETING.

   WE ARE READY TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INCIDENT TO A MINIMUM.
HOWEVER, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND I MUST ADMIT THERE IS ALWAYS
THE POSSIBILITY OF SABOTAGE OR A TERRORIST ACT. THIS DOES NOT
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT WILL AFFECT THE SECURITY MEASURES IN THE AREA
OF THE MEETING. FOR EXAMPLE, A BLACKOUT CAN BE CAUSED BY CUTTING OFF
AN ELECTRIC LINE IN A DISTANT AREA.

   [REPORTER] GENERAL, THE FMLN'S ATTACKS HAVE NOT BEEN SO
OVERWHELMING IN THE PAST, YET NOW THOSE ATTACKS ARE ATTAINING
CONSIDERABLE MILITARY SUCCESS. DO THE FMLN'S MILITARY ACTIONS MEAN IT
IS SUPERIOR TO THE ARMED FORCES?

   [VIDES] WE CANNOT CONCEIVE THEIR MILITARY SUPERIORITY UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE NOTICED THE GUERRILLA LEADERS ARE CURRENTLY
VISITING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE CONTADORA GROUP
MEMBERS. THEY ARE TRYING TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR READING A STATEMENT AT
THE OAS MEETING, AND THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO PRESSURE THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT INTO NEGOTIATING WITH THEM. THIS PROVES THE REBELS HAVE
FAILED MILITARILY, AND THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY OUR
LARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT AND
USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE REBELS HAVE TRIED TO BRING THE WAR TO URBAN AREAS.  HOWEVER,
THE PLANS OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS--I SHOWED YOU THE DOCUMENTS ON THEIR
FIRE PLAN IN ANOTHER MEETING--DID NOT INCLUDE THE TYPE OF TERRORIST
ACTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN LATELY. INSTEAD, THEY PLANNED A GENERAL
UPRISING AND STRIKE BEFORE THE ELECTIONS.

   THIS PROVES, AS I SAID, THAT THE SUBVERSIVES COULD NOT DEVELOP
THEIR FIRE PLAN. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT SEVERAL ACTS BUT THEY HAVE
FAILED TO ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED RESULTS.  THIS IS LIKE HAVING A CINEMA
SHOW A MOVIE EVERY DAY WITH NO-ONE TURNING UP TO SEE IT.

   THE SUBVERSIVES ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF EVENT RIGHT
NOW TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF MILITARY STRENGTH, SO THE OAS WILL PASS
A RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING NEGOTIATION TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT.

   FURTHERMORE, THE REBELS ARE TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS AND BOYCOTT OUR NEXT ELECTIONS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE
DEMORALIZED BY TERRORISM AND LACK THE WILL TO PARTICIPATE IN POLITICS,
WHICH MAKES THE ELECTION RESULTS UNSATISFACTORY. [CONTINUED]

OF A 5-YEAR TERM OF OFFICE WHICH BEGAN IN 1985.

   THE PROVISIONS APPROVED BY CONGRESS AMEND 6 ARTICLES IN SECTION 8,
VOLUME 2 OF THE PERUVIAN PENAL CODE, ADDING MORE SEVERE SENTENCES AND
THE MEANS FOR EXPANDING COURT ACTIONS AGAINST SUBVERSION.

   A PRISON TERM OF 20 YEARS OR MORE WILL BE IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO
CAUSE ANXIETY, ALARM, OR TERROR AMONG THE POPULATION OR ANY PART OF
IT, ACTS AGAINST A PERSON'S LIFE OR HEALTH, OR ACTS AGAINST PRIVATE OR
PUBLIC PROPERTY IF SUCH ACTS IMPAIR THE COMMUNITY'S BASIC SERVICES.

   IN ALL CASES, THE INSTIGATORS OR MASTERMINDS, THE PRINCIPALS IN THE
SECOND DEGREE, AND THE ACCOMPLICES WILL RECEIVE THE SAME SENTENCES AS
THE PERPETRATORS.

   MORE SEVERE SENTENCES HAVE ALSO BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR CASES IN WHICH
A PERPETRATOR BELONGS TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT USES TERRORISM AS A
MEANS TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, INCLUDING THE MAOIST "SHINING PATH"
ORGANIZATION AND THE MRTA.

   SUPPORTING, APPROVING, OR PRAISING TERRORIST ACTS CAN BE PUNISHED
WITH PRISON TERMS OF 5 YEARS OR MORE, AND A 5-YEAR PRISON TERM HAS
BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE CRIME OF MAKING, PURCHASING, STEALING, OR
STORING WEAPONS OR EXPLOSIVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF TERRORISM.

   MORE THAN 12,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN PERU IN SUBVERSIVE AND
ANTI-SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS SINCE THE "SHINING PATH" ORGANIZATION BEGAN
ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980. MORE THAN $10 BILLION IN MATERIAL LOSSES
HAVE BEEN REGISTERED AS WELL.

   BOGOTA, 17 NOV 88 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [REPORT]
[RAUL GUTIERREZ] [TEXT] A NEW DIPLOMATIC RIFT HAS ARISEN BETWEEN
COLOMBIA AND THE NEIGHBORING REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA FOLLOWING A PROTEST
NOTE SENT BY OUR FOREIGN MINISTRY TO THE VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTRY.
THE NOTE DENOUNCES THE MASSACRE OF 14 FISHERMEN, INCLUDING TWO
COLOMBIANS WHOM THE VENEZUELAN ARMED FORCES ACCUSED OF BEING
SUBVERSIVES.

   THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT DECIDED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SCOLDED BY
COLOMBIA, SO THE VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SENT A NOTE TO OUR
FOREIGN MINISTRY WHICH SAID THAT VENEZUELA REJECTED THE TERMS USED IN
THE COLOMBIAN PROTEST NOTE.

   COLOMBIA HAS SENT 17 FOREIGN MINISTRY NOTES TO VENEZUELA IN THE
PAST 2 YEARS, ALL CONCERNING INCIDENTS THAT HAVE DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY AFFECTED COLOMBIAN CITIZENS.  ONLY 2 OF THE 17 PROTEST
NOTES HAVE RECEIVED A REPLY, AND THEY NEVER INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF
THE INVESTIGATIONS REQUESTED BY OUR GOVERNMENT.

   THE LAST NOTE REPRESENTS A PROTEST FROM OUR GOVERNMENT FOR THE
MURDER OF JOSE ANTONIO AREGUA AND JUSTO PASTOR CEBALLOS ON 29 OCTOBER.
THEY WERE ASSASSINATED ALONG WITH 12 VENEZUELAN CITIZENS WHEN THE
VENEZUELAN ARMY MISTOOK THEM FOR NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY REBELS IN
CANO COLORADA, ARAUCA DEPARTMENT, ALONG THE VENEZUELAN BORDER.

   EVEN THOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES MADE
A MISTAKE, THE COUNTRY'S REPLY TO THE NOTE WAS SPITEFUL AND
UNSATISFACTORY. THIS REPRESENTS THE WORST DIPLOMATIC INCIDENT BETWEEN
THE TWO COUNTRIES SO FAR THIS YEAR.

   ILDEGAR PEREZ, VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR TO COLOMBIA, PERSONALLY
REFERRED TO THE STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PEREZ] LET US SAY THAT RELATIONS AT THIS POINT
ARE DELICATE, BUT I WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE THEM AS CRITICAL OR
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. [END RECORDING]

   THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT HAS ORDERED THAT THE TWO SURVIVORS OF THE
29 OCTOBER MASSACRE AT THE BORDER BE TRIED. MOREOVER, THE DISPUTE
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS BEING EXPLOITED IN THE VENEZUELAN
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.  VERY FEW, HOWEVER, DARE TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE SITUATION.

   [VENEZUELAN DEPUTY JUVENCIO PULGAR] [BEGIN RECORDING] WE HAVE
DISPUTES AND WE SHOULD NOT COVER THEM UP. COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA HAVE
THINGS TO PROTEST ABOUT, BUT ONLY A DIALOGUE WILL LEAD TO AN AGREEMENT
TO SETTLE THESE DISPUTES. [END RECORDING]

[TEXT] [CONTINUED]

   THE INFLATION `BOGEYMAN'

   THIS ENTIRE PANORAMA CHANGED WITH THE NO VOTE VICTORY.  AND WITH IT
CHANGED THE POLICIES AND TOOLS THAT BUCHI'S TEAM WILL HAVE TO RESORT
TO UNTIL LATE 1989 AND THAT ARE NOW MUCH MORE DEPENDENT THAN BEFORE ON
THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. ONE OPTION IS TO KEEP ON DOING
"MORE OF THE SAME," TO IGNORE THE NEW CONTEXT THAT HAS DEVELOPED
SINCE 5 OCTOBER, TO DEFUSE THE MONETARY TIME BOMB AND TO APPLY A TIGHT
TOURNIQUET TO THE ECONOMY TO PREVENT RENEWED OUTBREAKS OF HIGHER
PRICES.

   THE INFLATION "BOGEYMAN" IS BEGINNING TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE FELT
(THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, CPI, IS EXPECTED TO BE UP 1.3 TO 1.5
PERCENT THIS MONTH), AND EXPLANATIONS ABOUND. GERARDO ACEITUNO, THE
HEAD OF THE FORECASTING WORKSHOP OF THE LABOR ECONOMY PROGRAM,
ATTRIBUTES THE MOUNTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES TO THE IMPACT OF THE
WAGE HIKE AND HIGHER INTERNATIONAL INTEREST RATES ON DOMESTIC PRICES.
HE RECALLS THAT THE PRICES OF FARM PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN "VIRTUALLY
FROZEN FOR A YEAR" AND THAT THIS EXPLAINS THE HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE
WHOLESALE PRICE INDEX, WHICH FELL ONE PERCENT DURING THE PAST 12
MONTHS, AND THE CPI, WHICH ROSE 12 PERCENT DURING THE SAME PERIOD.
"THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED, EXCEPT IF BUSINESSMEN WANTED
TO SACRIFICE THEIR PROFIT MARGINS, WHICH HAVE SO FAR NOT BEEN
AFFECTED, BECAUSE THE VAT WAS CUT."

   JUAN VILLARZU, IN CONTRAST, PLACES MOST OF THE BLAME FOR THE
INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ON THE EXCESSIVE QUANTITY OF MONEY. ODDLY
ENOUGH, HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTY THAT DEVELOPED AFTER THE VICTORY OF
THE NO VOTE IS PRESUMABLY HAVING AN EFFECT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE
"MINI-ADJUSTMENT."  HE REPORTS THAT SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED
BUSINESSMEN ARE POSTPONING THEIR INVESTMENT PLANS, AND THUS THEIR
DEMAND FOR CREDIT HAS FALLEN OFF. THE DILEMMA FACING THEM AND OTHER
"ECONOMIC AGENTS" IS WHETHER TO SPEND THE MONEY OR TO DEPOSIT IT.
THE CENTRAL BANK COMES INTO PLAY HERE, BECAUSE "NOT HAVING TO COMPETE
WITH THE BANKS, IT CAN BEGIN SOAKING UP SOME OF THE MONEY IN
CIRCULATION WITHOUT BOOSTING INTEREST RATES TOO MUCH. MOREOVER, THEY
ARE ALREADY QUITE HIGH: 5 PERCENT FOR 90-DAY OPERATIONS, AS AGAINST
4.2 PERCENT DURING THE FIRST HALF." IN ADDITION, IT COULD RESORT TO
ITS SIZABLE MONETARY RESERVES AND "BURN UP" FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON
HIGHER IMPORTS TO ABSORB SOME OF THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY.  "I'M THINKING
ABOUT DEVALUATIONS (OF THE PESO) SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE ONES THIS
YEAR."

   OPTIONS AFTER THE NO VICTORY

   IN ANY EVENT, THE LARGE MASS OF MONEY IN CIRCULATION AND THE
EXISTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES (WHATEVER THEIR CAUSE) "CONSTITUTE AN
EXPLOSIVE SITUATION," WHICH ACCORDING TO VILLARZU THE GOVERNMENT WILL
NOT IGNORE. BECAUSE "IF IT HAS ANY POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT LEFT, IT
IS THE VICTORY OVER INFLATION." AND THE TIGHTENING UP WILL BE EVEN
MORE SEVERE IF THE FINANCE MINISTER INSISTS ON ACHIEVING A 5-PERCENT
RISE IN THE CPI IN 1989, AS THE DRAFT BUDGET SENT TO THE JUNTA CALLS
FOR. EVEN THE CENTRAL BANK REGARDS THIS GOAL AS DANGEROUS. A
HIGH-LEVEL CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE SAID THAT "IT IS VALID TO AIM FOR
AN INFLATION RATE LIKE THAT IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT WE HAVE TO
BE CAREFUL BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT (WHICH WOULD TRIGGER A HEAVY
CONCENTRATION OF SPENDING) REMAINS HIGH."

   ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC CARD ARE THE ALREADY
VISIBLE AND STRONG PRESSURES THAT THE RIGHT HAS BEGUN TO APPLY SO THAT
THE GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE SPENDING IN 1989 OR AT LEAST NOT REDUCE
IT. THE RIGHT ALSO WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARE MORE
POPULIST IN NATURE OR THAT HAVE LESS VISIBLE EFFECTS ON VOTERS.
SIGNIFICANTLY, EXPERTS ON BUCHI'S OWN TEAM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE
ADMITTING THAT POLITICAL DEMANDS CAN BE GIVEN TO SOME EXTENT WITHOUT
IGNORING CERTAIN PRINCIPLES.  GAINING GROUND, AS A RESULT, ARE AN
INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE ("TO PAVE THE WAY FOR HIGHER PAY IN
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE") AND FURTHER CUTS IN THE VAT (THE RUMOR OF A CUT
TO 12 PERCENT WAS ALREADY MAKING THE ROUNDS BEFORE THE PLEBISCITE) AND
IN THE TAX ON CAPITAL.  BUT THE PRIVATIZATION OF ENTERPRISES IS STILL
STRONGLY SUPPORTED AS WELL. EVERYTHING POINTS IN THE SAME DIRECTION:
"REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT SECTOR AND, AT THE SAME
TIME, NARROW THE MANEUVERING ROOM ON TAXES FOR A GOVERNMENT DIFFERENT
FROM THIS ONE." IF IT IS SIMILAR, SO MUCH THE BETTER. [CONTINUED]

   THE GUERRILLAS TURN TERRORIST

   THE PRESIDENT OF PATRIOTIC UNION, BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, FEELS
THAT THE SANCTION IMPOSED ON THE TWO URABA UNIONS LAST WEEK WAS UNFAIR
BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THAT THE STRUGGLE OF THE WORKERS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE PHENOMENON OF VIOLENCE IN THE ZONE.

   JARAMILLO ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT THE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN URABA
HAVE SHIFTED FROM SUBVERSION TO ABSURD ACTS OF TERRORISM AND VANDALISM
THAT CANNOT BE COMPARED TO ACTS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY.

   THE LEFTIST LEADER DESCRIBED THIS TERRORIST ESCALADE AS ONE OF THE
MAJOR OBSTACLES TO THE REGION'S ACHIEVING THE SOCIAL PACT THAT IT
URGENTLY NEEDS.

   THE CONGRESSMAN FELT THAT THE SHUTDOWN OF THE UNIONS HAS DEPRIVED
THEM OF SPOKESMEN AND HE RECALLED THAT URABA HAS ACHIEVED ITS WEALTH
THROUGH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST GOVERNMENT
INVOLVEMENT.

   MORE SELF-CRITICISM

   SENATOR ALBERTO ROJAS PUYO, ONE OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION CONGRESSMEN,
CONTENDED YESTERDAY THAT THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CUT,
JORGE CARRILLO, OUGHT TO HELP PROMPT THE LEFT TO MAKE A SERIES OF
RECTIFICATIONS.

   ROJAS SAID: "JORGE CARRILLO'S LETTER OF RESIGNATION AS PRESIDENT
OF THE CUT CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT PROPOSALS NOT ONLY FOR THE
ORGANIZATION BUT ALSO FOR ALL DEMOCRATIC FORCES. I AM GLAD THAT HIS
RESIGNATION WAS NOT ACCEPTED AND I SEE IN THIS DEVELOPMENT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE FORCES OF THE LEFT WILL BEGIN A SERIOUS PROCESS
OF REFLECTION AND NECESSARY RECTIFICATION SO THAT THEIR STRUGGLES ARE
UNDERSTOOD AND TAKEN UP BY THE WORKING CLASS AND THE PEOPLE AT LARGE.

   "SOME OF CARRILLO'S PROPOSALS ARE, WITHOUT DOUBT, DEBATABLE, BUT
THE INDISCRIMINATE MIX OF ACTIONS IS UNQUESTIONABLY DOING GREAT DAMAGE
TO THE COUNTRY AND, MOST OF ALL, TO THE LEFT. A CLEAR LINE MUST BE
DRAWN IN WORD AND IN DEED WITH RESPECT TO VIOLENCE. THE FACT THAT SUCH
CRUCIAL ASPECTS FOR COLOMBIA'S DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT WERE DEBATED
WITHIN A MAJOR LABOR FEDERATION SHOWS THAT THIS CLASS CAN PLAY A
GUIDING ROLE FOR THE PEOPLE AT LARGE.

   "THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALONG WITH THE NECESSARY REFORMS, THE
UNITY OF THE FEDERATION AND ITS CAPACITY FOR ALLIANCES AND GRASSROOTS
MOBILIZATION EMERGE STRENGTHENED."

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 88 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [JOEL
BURGOS] [TEXT] COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN OF THE SALVADORAN
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] APPEARED BEFORE THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TODAY.
THE ASSEMBLY OFFERED TO LOOSEN LEGAL [WORD INDISTINCT] ON THE ARMED
FORCES TO WIN THE WAR.

   SOME GROUPS BELIEVE THE COUNTRY ENTERED A CRISIS WITH THE 15
OCTOBER 1979 MILITARY COUP. SINCE THEN, EL SALVADOR HAS SUFFERED A
CIVIL WAR THAT IS GETTING WORSE AND CAUSING MORE CASUALTIES. THERE ARE
NOW TWO DISTURBING CHANGES IN THE WAR: FIRST, CORPSES ARE BEING DUMPED
ON THE ROADSIDE, WHICH REMINDS US OF THE EARLY 1980'S WHEN DEATH
SQUADS WERE ACTIVE. SECOND, URBAN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS INCREASING.
THE ARMED FORCES ARE JUSTIFIABLY CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE ISSUES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] I NEVER TALK ABOUT DEATH SQUADS. I TALK
ABOUT VIOLENCE AND THE ACTIONS OF THE RIGHT- AND LEFT-WING GROUPS. THE
ARMY IS DETERMINED, AND IS MAKING ALL THE NECESSARY EFFORTS, TO
COUNTER THOSE VIOLENT ACTIONS, REGARDLESS OF WHICH GROUPS CARRY THEM
OUT. [END RECORDING]

   COL PONCE MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY DEFENSE AND
PUBLIC SECURITY COMMITTEE TODAY.

   AFTER 8 YEARS, THE WAR SEEMS TO BE ENDLESS. ARENA [NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] BELIEVES THAT A SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS COULD BE
THE FORMATION OF A COMMON FRONT THAT WILL SET UP A NATIONAL STRATEGY
AND ALSO LOOSEN LEGAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE ARMED FORCES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARENA DEPUTY SIGIFREDO OCHOA] WE MUST SET UP A
NATIONAL STRATEGY, BECAUSE WE CANNOT LET THE GUERRILLAS KILL US. I
THINK THAT WE MUST ACT WITHIN THE LAW. I THINK WE MUST LOOSEN THE
LEGAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE ARMY, BECAUSE THE ARMY CAN BE EFFECTIVE BUT
HAS ITS HANDS TIED. [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN ITS OWN COUNTRY, IT HAS BEEN
REJECTED FOR HAVING DEFENDED COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS [WORDS INDISTINCT],
WHICH IN [WORD INDISTINCT] ITSELF IS CONSIDERED AS [WORDS INDISTINCT].
WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW CAN IT DEFEND A CRIMINAL POSITION. IT IS TIME
FOR US TO RALLY AROUND A SINGLE PURPOSE. [END RECORDING]

   THERE CAN STILL BE A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS.  CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FIDEL CHAVEZ MENA SAID
HE WILL SEEK A DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT. MEANWHILE, ARENA
WILL MAKE ITS OWN PROPOSAL TO THE FMLN.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [OCHOA] THE PDC PROMISED TO ACHIEVE PEACE. THAT
IS AN ILLUSION. THAT IS WHAT THE PDC CANDIDATE IS PROPOSING.  CHAVEZ
MENA HAS BEEN IN THE GOVERNMENT FOR YEARS, AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT
CHANGE ITS STRATEGY. THAT PROPOSAL IS MERELY A SMOKESCREEN.

   WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS. WE MUST SIT DOWN TO TALK WITH
THE REBELS WITHIN A STRICT TIME LIMIT AND WITHOUT SO MUCH DEMAGOGY. WE
ARE WILLING TO TALK WITH THE FMLN-FDR. WE WANT TO MAKE A PROPOSAL TO
THEM--NOT AN ARENA PROPOSAL, BUT A NATIONAL PROPOSAL. [END RECORDING]

WITH SENATOR ALVARO LEYVA DURAN BY MARIA CLARA GRACIA, IN PROGRESS]
[TEXT] [BEGIN RECORDING] [LEYVA] ...OVER THE RED TELEPHONE AND SECOND,
ALL HOSTILITIES HAVE UNILATERALLY ENDED ON ALL FARC FRONTS.  THE
GOVERNMENT ONCE ASKED ME WHY THEY DO NOT BEGIN A UNILATERAL END OF
HOSTILITIES IF THEY HAVE GOODWILL. HERE IT IS. I CANNOT DO ANY MORE; I
HOPE THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT LET THIS OPPORTUNITY PASS.

   [GRACIA] DO YOU BELIEVE TALKS SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THE GUERRILLA
GROUPS?

   [LEYVA] THE TRUTH IS THAT I PROPOSED SOMETHING TO THE GOVERNMENT,
THE POLITICAL PARTIES, AND THE GUERRILLAS.  WHAT YOU CALL TALKS IS
NOTHING MORE THAN THE GUERRILLAS' REPLY TO THE PROPOSAL--THE SAME WAY
AS [FORMER PRESIDENT] DR TURBAY, SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY PRESIDENT
DR FABIO VALENCIA, AND DR JARAMILLO OSSA OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION DID.
THE CARDINALS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE PROPOSAL, AND THE M-19 AND
FARC HAVE REPLIED. IN FACT, THEY WENT EVEN FURTHER; THEY UNILATERALLY
ENDED HOSTILITIES.  NOW THE BALL IS IN THE GOVERNMENT'S COURT.

   [GRACIA] TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT AFTER AGREEING NOT TO, FOR
EXAMPLE, CARRY OUT ANY AMBUSHES AGAINST TROOPS, THE GUERRILLAS
CONTINUED; THEY BROKE THE AGREEMENT. DO YOU THINK WE CAN AGAIN TRUST
THESE STATEMENTS?

   [LEYVA] I CANNOT MEASURE THE CONFIDENCE THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO
OTHERS. THE ONLY THING I KNOW IS THE GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING PEACE, SO I
IMAGINE THIS IS PRECISELY THE WAY. THE SUSPICION THAT THE GOVERNMENT
MIGHT HAVE OF THEM IS THE SAME AS YOU MIGHT HAVE, BUT IF THE
GOVERNMENT SEEKS PEACE, HERE IS WHERE THEY CAN FIND IT, WITH A
PRELIMINARY END TO HOSTILITIES ON ALL FRONTS. THIS IS WHAT [FARC
GENERAL SECRETARY] JACOBO ARENAS WROTE IN A LETTER THAT WAS NOT
ADDRESSED TO ME BUT TO THE FORMER PRESIDENTS OF COLOMBIA. [END

EXTREMISTS AMBUSHED AND KILLED 68 PEASANTS IN THE LOCALITY OF BALCON,
200 KM NORTH OF THE SOUTHERN CITY OF AYACUCHO.

   A PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL UNIT WAS COMBING THE AREA IN SEARCH OF
GUERRILLAS WHEN IT WAS AMBUSHED ON 22 NOVEMBER, THE NEWSPAPER EXPRESO
REPORTED TODAY.

   THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE HAS HIT PERUVIAN TOURIST ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE
CITY OF HUARAZ, CAPITAL OF THE ANCASH DEPARTMENT, WHERE FOUR INNS AND
HOTELS WERE BOMBED LAST NIGHT, DAMAGING THE BUILDINGS AND INJURING AN
18 YEAR-OLD GIRL.

   IN CUSCO, 1,000 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, A BUS [AS RECEIVED] HEADING
TOWARD MACHU PICHU WENT OUT OF CONTROL AS THE RESULT OF SABOTAGE AND
FELL INTO A 60-METER RAVINE. THE WIVES OF THE JERSEY CITY, UNITED
STATES, AND CUSCO MAYORS DIED IN THIS ACCIDENT.

   LEFTIST SENATOR ENRIQUE BERNALES BALLESTEROS, PRESIDENT OF THE
SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND STUDY OF TERRORISM AND
VIOLENCE, HAS NOTED THAT THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE HAS CLAIMED THE
LIVES OF 21 PEOPLE PER DAY DURING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER. HE SAID THAT
THE INCREASED VIOLENCE CAN BE TRACED TO ACTIONS BY THE TERRORIST
GROUPS SHINING PATH AND TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA).
THESE ATTACKS WERE REPRESSED BY THE FORCES OF ORDER.

   SENATOR BERNALES REPORTED THAT 630 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN VIOLENT
ACTS IN NOVEMBER AND THAT 1,775 HAVE BEEN KILLED OVER THE PAST 12
MONTHS.

   BERNALES SAID THAT 403 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN NOVEMBER AS A RESULT
OF VIOLENT ACTS, INCLUDING 147 CIVILIANS, 165 PRESUMED TERRORISTS, 65
ARMED FORCES MEMBERS, AND 26 DRUG TRAFFICKERS. A TOTAL OF 227 PEOPLE
WERE KILLED IN URBAN VIOLENT ACTS.

   SENATOR BERNALES ADDED THAT A TOTAL OF NEARLY 13,000 PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN KILLED SINCE THE TERRORIST VIOLENCE BEGAN IN 1980.

   BERNALES EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE FACT THAT 67 PERCENT OF THE
PEOPLE KILLED IN VIOLENT ACTS INVOLVED YOUTHS WHO WERE BETWEEN 15 AND
29 YEARS OF AGE. HE ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH GUIDELINES TO
COUNTER THIS SOCIAL PHENOMENON.

   AMID THIS BLOODY AND DESTRUCTIVE SITUATION, THE PERUVIAN EPISCOPAL
CONFERENCE HAS MADE A CHRISTMAS APPEAL, ASKING THAT--WITHOUT IGNORING
"THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION"--FOR A TRUCE "FOR PEACE,
RECONCILIATION, AND TRANQUILLITY" TO PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY.

   THE BISHOPS SAID: "RECALLING HE WHO PREVAILED OVER DEATH, WE CALL
UPON THOSE WHO HAVE RESORTED TO VIOLENCE AND KILLINGS AS A SOLUTION TO
THE EVILS OF SOCIETY, TO ALLOW THE CITIZENS FOR WHOM THEY CLAIM TO
STRUGGLE TO LIVE LIKE BROTHERS."

NOVEMBER. MEANWHILE, THE FMLN REBELS HAVE SAID THEY INFLICTED 991
CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY--INCLUDING DEAD AND WOUNDED--AS A RESULT OF
THEIR ATTACKS, HARASSMENT, AND AMBUSHES DURING THE SAME PERIOD.

   THE MILITARY REPORT SAYS 93 FMLN GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND 115
WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF NATIONWIDE COUNTERINSURGENCY MILITARY
OPERATIONS DURING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER.

   THE REPORT ADDED THAT DURING THE SAME PERIOD, THE ARMY CONFISCATED
105 HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES, 2 M-60 MACHINEGUNS, 20 REVOLVERS OF VARIOUS
CALIBERS, MORE THAN 55,000 CARTRIDGES, 168 FRAGMENTATION GRENADES, 236
MINES, 9 COMMUNICATION RADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL FOR
HOMEMADE BOMBS.

   THE MILITARY REPORT ADDED THAT DURING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER,
GUERRILLAS KILLED 43 PEASANTS, KIDNAPPED 32, AND CAUSED THE DEATH OF 6
PEOPLE AND CRIPPLED 23 OTHERS AS A RESULT OF MINE EXPLOSIONS.

   IN THE WAR AGAINST PUBLIC PROPERTY--THE PILLAR OF A WAR
ECONOMY--THE MILITARY SOURCE REPORTED THAT SIX MAYORIAL OFFICES AND
SIX NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFICES WERE
DAMAGED IN VARIOUS TOWNS AND SIX JUNCTION BOXES WERE SABOTAGED.

   IN ADDITION, 4 TRAINS BELONGING TO THE SALVADORAN NATIONAL
RAILROAD, FENADESAL, WERE BLOWN UP, AND 10 VEHICLES AND 5 BUSES WERE
PARTIALLY DAMAGED.

   REGARDING DAMAGE TO THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, THE FMLN KNOCKED DOWN
46 TOWERS AND 136 HIGH-TENSION POWER POLES AND DAMAGED 11
TRANSFORMERS.

   HAVANA, 3 DEC 88 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
FRANCISCO VILLAGRAN, MEMBER OF THE URNG POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC
COMMISSION, BY PEDRO MARTINEZ] [TEXT] [MARTINEZ] THERE IS A SUBJECT OF
INTEREST TO RADIO HAVANA LISTENERS: THE URNG'S HUMANIZATION OF THE WAR
POLICY.

   [VILLAGRAN] RIGHT NOW, THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION, ON
DIRECTIONS FROM THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND, IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO
HUMANIZE THE WAR SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY BY SHOWING
RESPECT FOR THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, WHICH GUATEMALA SIGNED.

   WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THE REPRESSIVE WAR THE ARMY HAS BEEN
WAGING AGAINST THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE POPULATION HAS
REACHED LEVELS OF EXTREME CRUELTY, INCLUDING INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS
AND THE USE OF DEFOLIANTS IN CONFLICT ZONES WHERE CIVILIANS LIVE.

   THERE IS THE PARTICULAR SITUATION IN WHICH NEITHER THE GUATEMALAN
ARMY NOR THE GOVERNMENT TAKE ANY WAR PRISONERS. THIS MAKES US BELIEVE
THAT THE CRUELTY USED AGAINST CIVILIANS AND PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE
ARMED CONFLICT IS A VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.

   [MARTINEZ] DOES THE URNG HAVE ANY PRISONERS AT THIS MOMENT?

   [VILLAGRAN] YES. WE HAVE SENT A NOTE TO THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
COMMISSION SO IT CAN HANDLE THE CASE OF SOLDIER CARLOS PEREZ LOPEZ,
WHO WAS CAPTURED WOUNDED IN THE SAN MARCOS REGION, NEAR GALVEZ. HE HAS
BEEN GIVEN MUCH MEDICAL ATTENTION. NOW THAT HE HAS FULLY RECOVERED, WE
ARE THINKING ABOUT PUBLICLY RETURNING THIS GUATEMALAN, AND WE ARE
ASKING THE RECONCILIATION COMMISSION TO TAKE MEASURES THROUGH THE
INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS [IRC] TO RECEIVE THIS MAN IN THE FRAMEWORK OF
THE HUMANIZATION PROCESS.

   [MARTINEZ] WILL THIS BE THE FIRST TIME THE URNG WILL MAKE THIS KIND
OF CONTACT WITH THE IRC?

   [VILLAGRAN] THE IRC HAS HAD LOCALIZATION PROBLEMS.  THERE HAS BEEN
THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS A NATIONAL RED CROSS. CONTACT WITH THE IRC
IS POSSIBLE IF THERE IS A PRESENCE OF THIS ORGANIZATION THAT FUNCTIONS
BASED ON INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. NOW THAT THE IRC IS PRESENT, THE
WORK IS BEING FACILITATED.

   THE CONTACT WITH THE IRC IS AT THE INITIATION LEVEL.  HOWEVER, I
BELIEVE THESE CONTACTS WILL BE VERY USEFUL IN THE FUTURE, ESPECIALLY
FOR PERSONS NOT INVOLVED IN THE ARMED CONFLICT.

   [MARTINEZ] I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF WE CLOSE THIS INTERVIEW
WITH YOU REPEATING THE NAME OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY SOLDIER WHO IS
BEING HELD BY THE URNG AND WHOM THE GUERRILLA FORCES ARE PREPARED TO
TURN OVER TO THE IRC.

   [VILLAGRAN] YES. HIS NAME IS CARLOS LOPEZ PEREZ [AS HEARD].

   [MARTINEZ] THANK YOU, VILLAGRAN.

   BOGOTA, 15 NOV 88 (SEMANA) -- [EXCERPTS] [PASSAGE OMITTED] IT WAS
BARELY NOON WHEN A MAN WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED ON A FLIGHT FROM MEDELLIN
WENT INTO THE NATIONAL BOOKSTORE TO BUY SOME NEWSPAPERS.  MEANWHILE,
HIS BODYGUARD-CHAUFFEUR WAITED FOR HIM IN THE LOBBY. THE MAN WITH THE
NEWSPAPERS, A CATTLEMAN NAMED GUSTAVO DE JESUS ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ, HAD
JUST LEFT THE BOOKSTORE WHEN THE TROUBLE STARTED. ESCOBAR WAS
PREPARING TO GO TO HIS CAR WHEN A MAN APPROACHED HIM.  THE MAN, AROUND
35 YEARS OLD AND 5 FEET 9 INCHES TALL, TOOK OUT A 7.65 CALIBER PISTOL
AND BEGAN FIRING. PANIC SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE TERMINAL AS PEOPLE THREW
THEMSELVES ON THE FLOOR TO AVOID BEING SHOT.

   ESCOBAR IMMEDIATELY FELL TO THE FLOOR AS HIS ATTACKER TRIED TO
ESCAPE THROUGH ONE OF THE EXITS. APPARENTLY, HE DID NOT TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT THE PRESENCE OF THE BODYGUARD, WHO HAD ENOUGH TIME TO DRAW HIS
GUN AND SHOOT THE AGGRESSOR, WHO DIED AT THE SCENE. ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ
WAS TAKEN TO THE SAN PEDRO CLAVER CLINIC, WHERE HE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD
ON ARRIVAL. BUT THE TRAGIC EVENT DID NOT END THERE. A 20-YEAR-OLD
WOMAN WHO WAS AT THE AIRPORT, MARIA FLOREZ GUTIERREZ, WAS SERIOUSLY
WOUNDED AND HER CONDITION WAS LISTED AS SERIOUS WHEN THIS EDITION WENT
TO PRINT.

   EARLY DETAILS DID NOT CLARIFY THE MOTIVATION FOR THE ATTACK.
ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS FOUND IN HIS CLOTHING, IN ADDITION TO HIS
ACTIVITIES AS A CATTLEMAN, GUSTAVO DE JESUS ESCOBAR WAS A LEGAL
ADVISOR IN CONGRESS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS DENIED BY SPOKESMEN FROM THAT
INSTITUTION. THINGS TOOK ANOTHER TURN THAT EVENING, WHEN THE
TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAM 24 HOURS REPORTED THAT ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ WAS
THE COUSIN OF PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA. THIS GAVE RISE TO THE SUPPOSITION
THAT THE ATTACK WAS LINKED TO THE SERIES OF KILLINGS IN THE SO-CALLED
"CARTEL WAR."

   AS TO THE ATTACKER, NEITHER HIS REAL MOTIVES NOR HIS IDENTITY WERE
KNOWN AT THE END OF THE WEEK. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   BOGOTA, 10 DEC 88 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] THE
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT MEDIATORS IN A DIALOGUE WITH THE
GUERRILLAS, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA HAS SAID. THE
OFFICIAL ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THE
POLITICIANS OR GUERRILLAS WHO ATTEND THE REGIONAL TALKS WHICH ARE
TAKING PLACE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER ALSO WARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT
CHANGE ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE REBELS AND THAT ANY MEETINGS IN SEARCH
OF PEACE WILL ONLY TAKE PLACE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLA
LEADERS. EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT RESPONDED TO SENATOR
ALVARO LEIVA'S PROPOSAL, WHICH CALLS FOR A TOP-LEVEL COMMISSION TO
HOLD TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, THE FARC AND THE M-19 GUERRILLAS HAVE
ALREADY ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF
SUCH A COMMISSION, THEY WOULD IMMEDIATELY ORDER A TRUCE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PARDO] THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT ASSUME THAT
RESPONSIBILITY WITH PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS. OUR PEACE INITIATIVE CALLS
FOR A DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH GUERRILLAS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO A
RECONCILIATION, ONCE THE RIGHT CONDITIONS ARE PRESENT. THIS POSITION
REMAINS UNCHANGED.

   [REPORTER] DOES THIS MEAN SENATOR ALVARO LEIVA'S PROPOSAL HAS NOT
BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT?

   [PARDO] NO, THE GOVERNMENT WILL RESPOND TO DR LEIVA'S PROPOSAL IN
THE NEXT FEW DAYS. HIS PROPOSAL HAS BROUGHT ABOUT POSITIVE RESULTS IN
THE SENSE THAT THE FARC AND M-19 HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR DESIRE TO
SUSPEND TERRORIST ACTS. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ANNOUNCE A FORMAL RESPONSE
TO THIS PROPOSAL IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. [END RECORDING]

   MEANWHILE, FORMER PRESIDENTS BELISARIO BETHANCOURT AND MISAEL
PASTRANA BORRERO URGED THAT A COMMISSION BE FORMED FOR TALKS WITH THE
REBELS, WHICH THEY CONSIDER THE BEST CHANCE FOR PEACE.

ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT MAYOR HECTOR AREVALO OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC], WHO WAS ELECTED MAYOR IN A TOWN IN SAN VICENTE
DEPARTMENT LAST MARCH, RESIGNED BECAUSE OF DEATH THREATS FROM
SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.

   AREVALO IS THE FIRST MAYOR TO RESIGN AS A RESULT OF FMLN THREATS.
THE FMLN CLAIMS MAYORS ARE PART OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN
CONDUCTED BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY.

   AREVALO, 39, WAS REPORTEDLY THREATENED WITH DEATH BY THE
GUERRILLAS, WHO ALSO ORDERED HIM TO LEAVE THE TOWN OF SANTA CLARA, 65
KM EAST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   AFTER ANNOUNCING HIS RESIGNATION, AREVALO SAID: "I WANT TO LIVE

AND CHILDREN WHO NEED ME."  AREVALO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT HE CANNOT
LEAVE SANTA CLARA, A TOWN OF APPROXIMATELY 10,000 PEOPLE, BECAUSE HE
CANNOT AFFORD TO DO SO.

   THE FMLN ALSO CLAIMS THAT IN MANY TOWNS IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN EL
SALVADOR, AN AREA OVER WHICH IT CLAIMS TO HAVE MORE CONTROL THAN THE
ARMY, THERE ARE TWO POWER CENTERS: ONE IS THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT, AND
THE OTHER IS THE GOVERNMENT. THE FMLN HAS STATED THAT IT WILL NOT
ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL THAT REGION.

   THUS FAR THIS YEAR, THE FMLN HAS KILLED EIGHT PDC AND RIGHTIST
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE MAYORS IN SANTA ANA, MORAZAN, SAN
MIGUEL, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS.

   SANTIAGO, 10 NOV 88 (QUE PASA) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED]

   VARYING INTENTIONS

   THE PROGRAM FOR LEGAL ACTION CERTAINLY RAISES DIFFERENT
EXPECTATIONS AMONG THE PARTNERS IN IU. THERE HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT THAT
IN RECENT DAYS. ALL INDICATIONS ARE, INDEED, THAT BECAUSE TIME IS
RUNNING SHORT THEY WILL START UP WITHOUT MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION. TO PUT
IT MORE CLEARLY, THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THEY WILL WAIT UNTIL THINGS
ARE UNDER WAY BEFORE TRYING TO PUT THEIR OWN MARK ON THE NEWBORN.

   CHRISTIAN LEFT [IC] WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THIS SIGNAL. THE
RESOLUTIONS OF ITS PLENUM, MADE PUBLIC ON 28 OCTOBER, CLEARLY REVEALED
THAT IT INTENDED TO UNIFY THE ENTIRE LEFT IN THE FORMATION OF THE NEW
POLITICAL ENTITY. IN PASSING, THEY SENT A MESSAGE TO THEIR MEN WHO
WERE INVOLVED IN THE PPD [PARTY FOR DEMOCRACY]: THEY HAVE TO DECIDE
BETWEEN MEMBERSHIP IN ONE OR THE OTHER, BUT NOT BOTH.  THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT MAPU [UNITED POPULAR ACTION MOVEMENT]-BARRUETO IS NOT
ADDRESSING WITH THE SAME EARNESTNESS. THEY APPARENTLY SEEK TO TAKE
PART IN EVERY GROUP THERE IS, WHETHER IT IS CALLED THE PPD, COSONO
[SOCIALIST COMMAND FOR THE NO] OR LEFTIST PARTY.

   THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PEOPLE WENT EVEN FURTHER. AT NO TIME DID THEY
CONCEAL THEIR WISH THAT LUIS MAIRA PRESIDE OVER THE NEW PARTY.

   THE PLENUM OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY [PS]-ALMEYDA WAS, OF COURSE, THE
MOST EAGERLY ANTICIPATED. AS ON OTHER OCCASIONS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO
SET THE TONE FOR THE JOCKEYING BY THE LEFT. THEY AMBITIOUSLY FELT THAT
THIS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE SOME STRATEGIC OBSTACLES, SORT OF
LIKE KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE: REGISTRATION AND THE
SOUGHT-AFTER SOCIALIST UNITY.

   PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THEY HELD THEIR PLENUM, WHERE ON 28 AND 29
OCTOBER THEY DISCUSSED THE ADVANTAGES OF REGISTERING THEIR OWN PARTY,
IN OTHER WORDS, RESPONDING ONCE AND FOR ALL TO THE INITIATIVES OF THE
NUNEZES, WHO TOOK OVER THE PPD, THE ONLY LEGALLY RECOGNIZED SOCIALIST
GROUP.  OTHERS THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WISER TO PROMOTE A PARTY IN
THE "SOCIALIST SPACE," BRING TOGETHER THERE CHRISTIAN LEFT,
MAPU-BARRUETO AND THE SMALL SOCIALIST GROUPS THAT STILL EXIST, IN
OTHER WORDS, COSONO AS A PARTY. THIS STAND OBVIOUSLY GAVE PRIORITY TO
SOMETHING OF A LEADING POLITICAL ROLE AND KEPT THE PC AT A DISTANCE.

   THE OPTION OF REGISTERING A BROAD LEFT-WING GROUP WAS ALSO RAISED
AT THE PLENUM; TO MANY THIS ENTAILED A CERTAIN "SACRIFICE" OF
PREDOMINANCE BY THE SOCIALISTS.

   THE PS-ALMEYDA ULTIMATELY OPTED FOR A "CONSENSUS" VOTE, OF WHOSE
PUBLIC VERSION THERE WERE SEVERAL INTERPRETATIONS.  THERE WAS TALK OF
"THE REGISTRATION OF A LEGAL INSTRUMENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
SOCIALIST SPACE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE GRASSROOTS FORCES AND OF THE
PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST INDEPENDENTS WHO HAVE SO FAR BELONGED TO
UNLEGALIZED PARTIES." THE INTENTION OF THE SOCIALIST LANGUAGE WAS
CLEAR, BUT THE PARTY DID NOT CLOSE RANKS WITH A BROAD LEFT-WING
ALLIANCE. THE EMPHASIS WAS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER.

   WHAT WAS NOT MADE PUBLIC WAS THAT THE POLITICAL VOTE OF "THE MORE
THAN 50 AND FEWER THAN 100 PARTICIPANTS" SPOKE OF GIVING PRIORITY TO
SOCIALIST LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW PARTY. THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOW
FOCUSING ON THIS. [CONTINUED]

PROFESSOR AT THE WESTERN CAMPUS OF THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.

   THE GUERRILLAS STATED THAT THE DEAD WOMAN WAS ACTIVE WITHIN THE
RANKS OF THE FMLN AND THAT HER ALIAS WAS "MARIANELA." THEY ADDED
THAT HER DEATH WAS A "REVOLUTIONARY EXECUTION" BECAUSE SHE WAS
CONSIDERED A TRAITOR TO THE ORGANIZATION.

   BOGOTA, 14 DEC 88 (LA PRENSA) -- [COMMUNIQUE FROM THE FARC TO
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THIS YEAR,
THE NATION HAS BEEN DISCUSSING PEACE IN A WAY SELDOM HEARD OF BEFORE.
ALL COLOMBIANS, INCLUDING ILLUSTRIOUS FORMER PRESIDENTS, THE MEDIA,
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, POLITICAL PARTIES, THE REBELS, AND THE NATION AT
LARGE, HAVE BEEN VOICING THEIR STRONG DESIRE FOR RECONCILIATION IN THE
HOMELAND.

   WE REBELS HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED PEACE HIGHLY. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE
ALWAYS CLEARLY REITERATED THIS IDEA. TO SET THE PROPER FRAME OF MIND,
WE WILL RECALL WHAT WAS SAID IN THE LA URIBE AGREEMENT ON 28 MARCH
1984:

   "TO ENSURE PEACE IN THE NATION--WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE
FOR THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE'S PROSPERITY--AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT BASED ON LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, THE FOLLOWING IS HEREBY
AGREED UPON.

   "1. THE FARC AND EP [POOR PEOPLE'S ARMY] WILL ORDER A CEASE-FIRE
AND THE SUSPENSION OF ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS IN ALL FRONTS THROUGHOUT
THE COUNTRY AS OF 0000 ON 28 MAY 1984.

   "2. THE FARC AND EP WILL AGAIN CONDEMN AND NOT ALLOW KIDNAPPINGS,
EXTORTION, AND TERRORISM IN ALL THEIR FORMS.  FARC-EP WILL HELP
ELIMINATE THESE PRACTICES BECAUSE THEY ARE AN ATTACK ON LIBERTY AND
HUMAN DIGNITY."

   IN ADDITION, THE M-19 AND EPL [PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY] REACHED
THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT: "... WE BELIEVE THE
CESSATION OF ARMED CLASHES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THE REBELS IS
AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE POLITICAL,
ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL REFORMS THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE NEED AND
DESIRE. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE HIGHEST INTERESTS OF THE HOMELAND, THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS HAVE REACHED THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT: THE
NEGOTIATION AND DIALOGUE COMMISSION, THE EPL GENERAL COMMAND, AND THE
M-19 HIGH COMMAND HAVE AGREED ON A CEASE-FIRE. ONCE THIS IS CARRIED
OUT, A GREAT NATIONAL DIALOGUE WILL BEGIN, DEVELOP, AND CONCLUDE.
THROUGH THIS DIALOGUE, ALL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SECTORS WILL BE ABLE
TO EXPRESS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SEARCH FOR PEACE BASED ON SOCIAL
JUSTICE.

   "CONSEQUENTLY, THE EPL GENERAL COMMAND AND THE M-19 HIGH COMMAND
HEREBY ORDER ALL FRONTS, COLUMNS, AND UNITS TO CEASE FIRING AND
SUSPEND ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS AS OF 1300 ON 30 AUGUST."

   THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER OF THESE ACCORDS IS NOW WORTH
CONSIDERING. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN COLOMBIANS SAID THESE ACCORDS
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS HAD BECOME THE COUNTRY'S NEW
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.

   THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR USELESS RECRIMINATIONS, BUT FOR A SERIOUS
EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHO IS TO BLAME BECAUSE THE ACCORDS WENT PARTIALLY
UNFULFILLED. ANYWAY, CONSIDERING THESE ACCORDS WILL NOT HARM THE
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY. WE HEREBY REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO TALK WITH
YOUR GOVERNMENT TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE COUNTRY'S
PROBLEMS.  THIS WILLINGNESS TO TALK IS SHARED BY ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF
THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD AND IS PART OF THE
CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THREE GUERRILLA SUMMIT MEETINGS.

   WE FULLY AGREE WITH THE PEACE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY SENATOR ALBERTO
LEYVA DURAN. WE FIND IT CLEAR, SIMPLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, AND COMPLETE.
THIS IS WHY WE WROTE THIS LETTER, MADE OUR LATEST STATEMENTS, AND HAVE
GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR A UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE AS THE BEST CHRISTMAS
GIFT FOR OUR PEOPLE.

   LIMA, 20 DEC 88 (EFE) -- [REPORT] [FRANCISCO FIGUEROA] [TEXT] THE
PERUVIAN GOVERNING PARTY, APRA, TODAY ENDED A CONFLICTIVE PARTY
CONGRESS ON A NOTE OF DEFEAT FOR PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, AND WITH THE
EMERGENCE OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER LUIS ALVA CASTRO AS NEW PARTY
LEADER.

   THE APRA CONGRESS ELIMINATED THE POST OF PARTY PRESIDENT, WHICH WAS
CREATED FOR ALAN GARCIA IN 1985, CONSOLIDATING HIS POSITION AS PARTY
LEADER FOLLOWING A DECISIVE VICTORY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF
THAT YEAR.

   ACCORDING TO SOME CRITICS WITHIN THE PARTY, THE PERSONALISM THAT
HAD CHARACTERIZED GARCIA'S UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP SINCE 1982 WAS THUS
ENDED.

   LUIS ALVA CASTRO, 46, FORMER PRIME MINISTER AND ECONOMY MINISTER AS
WELL AS FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, WAS ELECTED BY A
LARGE MARGIN AS THE NEW SECRETARY GENERAL, A POST WHICH REGAINED THE
HIGHEST STATUS IN THE PARTY. ALVA CASTRO CAPITALIZED ON THE INTERNAL
DISSIDENCE AND ON THE PARTY'S DISENCHANTMENT WITH ALAN GARCIA AS A
RESULT OF THE DETERIORATION OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION,
WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE WORST CRISIS IN THIS CENTURY AND IS BLAMED ON
THE CHIEF OF STATE'S "STUBBORNNESS" IN NOT CHANGING HIS
NATIONALISTIC AND POPULIST POLICY LINE."

   THE NEW CADRE ELECTED AT THE 16TH APRA CONGRESS IS IN FAVOR OF A
"CHANGE IN ORIENTATION" IN THE PARTY'S MANAGEMENT AND IN THE PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE REMAINING 18 MONTHS OF THE APRA'S TERM IN
OFFICE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT ALAN GARCIA AND ALVA CASTRO MAY REACH AN
AGREEMENT ON THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE RUN UNTIL 1990, WHEN THE
CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL TERM WILL END FOLLOWING NEW GENERAL ELECTIONS.

   GARCIA ALSO LOST THE PRESIDENCY OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION THAT
SETS THE PARTY'S POLITICAL LINE. THIS POST WAS WON BY LUIS ALBERTO
SANCHEZ, 88, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NATION AND ONE OF THE
MAINSPRINGS IN THE CHANGEOVER OPERATION WITHIN THE APRA.

   THE OTHER ELECTIVE POSITIONS WERE FILLED WITH APRA MEMBERS WHO DO
NOT FOLLOW GARCIA'S LINE. THUS, THE PRESENCE OF ALAN GARCIA WITHIN THE
PARTY WAS REDUCED TO BEING MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION IN HIS
CAPACITY AS FORMER PARTY SECRETARY GENERAL.

   TWO DAYS AGO, THE PERUVIAN CHIEF OF STATE RESIGNED THE APRA
PRESIDENCY, UPSET OVER CRITICISM DIRECTED AT HIM DURING THE OPENING OF
THE PARTY CONGRESS. HE THUS RESPONDED TO OBVIOUS SIGNS THAT THE PARTY
PRESIDENT POST WOULD BE ELIMINATED.

   THE APRA HAD THOUGHT ALAN GARCIA WOULD BE A VERY CAPABLE HEIR TO
VICTOR RAUL HAYA DE LA TORRE, THE PARTY'S FOUNDER AND HISTORICAL
LEADER, WHO DIED IN 1979. THREE AND ONE-HALF YEARS AFTER GARCIA'S
ELECTION VICTORY, THE PARTY DISQUALIFIED GARCIA FOR THE ROLE OF HAYA
DE LA TORRE'S SUCCESSOR BECAUSE OF HIS ERRORS AND HIS FAILURE TO
RECTIFY HIS GOVERNMENT LINE.

   FOLLOWING THE TRADITION INITIATED BY ALAN GARCIA, NEW APRA LEADER
LUIS ALVA CASTRO WILL BE SWORN IN AS SECRETARY GENERAL THIS COMING
FRIDAY BEFORE THE TOMB OF HAYA DE LA TORRE IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF
TRUJILLO, THE APRA'S MAIN BASTION.

   THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, MARKED BY 2,000-PERCENT INFLATION AND A
20-PERCENT RECESSION FROM OCTOBER 1987 TO OCTOBER 1988, IS COMPOUNDED
BY SOCIAL INSTABILITY AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE, WITH KILLINGS AVERAGING
FOUR PER DAY.

   AN INTERNAL POLITICAL STORM HIT THE APRA 16TH NATIONAL CONGRESS,
AND VICE PRESIDENT SANCHEZ SAID THAT HE CANNOT RECALL ANYTHING
SIMILAR.

   DURING THE LAST SESSION OF THE CONGRESS, THREE YOUTHS WERE INJURED
IN A MELEE AMONG APRA PEOPLE. OTHER PARTY MEMBERS WERE HIT ON THE HEAD
WITH HANDGUN BUTTS, AND THREE NEWSMEN--WHO HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO
ATTEND THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONGRESS--WERE ATTACKED.

JUSTIFIES THE OPERATION AND REITERATES THAT "THE FPMR HAS NOT GIVEN
UP ITS DECISION TO CARRY OUT ITS SENTENCE OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR
THIS INDIVIDUAL."

   THE ISSUE ALSO PUBLISHES AN EDITORIAL CONFIRMING THE NEED TO
REINVIGORATE THE "NATIONAL PATRIOTIC WAR." REMEMBERING THE FPMR
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY, THE EDITORIAL URGES THE MILITANTS "TO CONTINUE THE
ARMED FIGHT AGAINST TYRANNY."

   A REPORT THEN REVIEWS THE MOST IMPORTANT TERRORIST ATTACKS
PERPETRATED IN 1988. THE REPORT EMPHASIZES THE AMBUSH ON CARABINEROS
PATROLS, THE OCCUPATION OF LO QUENES AND AGUA GRANDE VILLAGE, AND
RETIRED COLONEL ROJAS LOBOS' EXECUTION.

   SOME PAGES ARE DEDICATED TO RAUL PELLEGRINI, ALIAS "COMMANDER
RODRIGO," AND OTHER FPMR "HEROES," INCLUDING CECILIA MAGNI, ALIAS
"COMMANDER TAMARA."

   THE ISSUE, WHICH WAS DISTRIBUTED A FEW DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS,
INCLUDES A PAMPHLET WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MANUFACTURE BOMBS, AND
POEMS URGING THE PEOPLE TO JOIN THE SUBVERSION AND THE ARMED FIGHT.
