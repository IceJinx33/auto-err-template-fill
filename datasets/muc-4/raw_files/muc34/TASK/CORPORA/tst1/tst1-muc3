   GUATEMALA CITY, 4 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GUATEMALA ARMY
DENIED TODAY THAT GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE "SANTO TOMAS" PRESIDENTIAL
FARM, LOCATED ON THE PACIFIC SIDE, WHERE PRESIDENT CEREZO HAS BEEN
STAYING SINCE 2 FEBRUARY.

   A REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE "CERIGUA" NEWS AGENCY -- MOUTHPIECE OF
THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG) -- WHOSE MAIN
OFFICES ARE IN MEXICO, SAYS THAT A GUERRILLA COLUMN ATTACKED THE FARM
2 DAYS AGO.

   HOWEVER, ARMED FORCES SPOKESMAN COLONEL LUIS ARTURO ISAACS SAID
THAT THE ATTACK, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF A CIVILIAN WHO WAS
PASSING BY AT THE TIME OF THE SKIRMISH, WAS NOT AGAINST THE FARM, AND
THAT PRESIDENT CEREZO IS SAFE AND SOUND.

   HE ADDED THAT ON 3 FEBRUARY PRESIDENT CEREZO MET WITH THE
DIPLOMATIC CORPS ACCREDITED IN GUATEMALA.

   THE GOVERNMENT ALSO ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE DESCRIBING THE REBEL REPORT
AS "FALSE AND INCORRECT," AND STRESSING THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NEVER
IN DANGER.

   COL ISAACS SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE "LA EMINENCIA"
FARM LOCATED NEAR THE "SANTO TOMAS" FARM, WHERE THEY BURNED THE
FACILITIES AND STOLE FOOD.

   A MILITARY PATROL CLASHED WITH A REBEL COLUMN AND INFLICTED THREE
CASUALTIES, WHICH WERE TAKEN AWAY BY THE GUERRILLAS WHO FLED TO THE
MOUNTAINS, ISAACS NOTED.

   HE ALSO REPORTED THAT GUERRILLAS KILLED A PEASANT IN THE CITY OF
FLORES, IN THE NORTHERN EL PETEN DEPARTMENT, AND BURNED A TANK TRUCK.

   SAN SALVADOR, 18 FEB 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] HEAVY FIGHTING WITH AIR
SUPPORT RAGED LAST NIGHT IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR WHEN MEMBERS OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] ATTACKED AN
ELECTRIC POWER SUBSTATION.  ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, A
SOLDIER GUARDING THE SUBSTATION WAS WOUNDED.

   THE FIRST EXPLOSIONS BEGAN AT 2330 [0530 GMT] AND CONTINUED UNTIL
EARLY THIS MORNING, WHEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS REQUESTED AIR SUPPORT AND
THE GUERRILLAS WITHDREW TO THE SLOPES OF THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO,
WHERE THEY ARE NOW BEING PURSUED.

   THE NOISE FROM THE ARTILLERY FIRE AND HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS WAS HEARD
THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL AND ITS OUTSKIRTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CROWDED
NEIGHBORHOODS OF NORTHERN AND NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR, SUCH AS
MIRALVALLE, SATELITE, MONTEBELLO, AND SAN RAMON.  SOME EXPLOSIONS
COULD STILL BE HEARD THIS MORNING.

   MEANWHILE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CITIES OF SAN MIGUEL AND
USULUTAN, THE LARGEST CITIES IN EASTERN EL SALVADOR, HAVE NO
ELECTRICITY BECAUSE OF GUERRILLA SABOTAGE ACTIVITY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 APR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] EL SALVADOR'S SUPREME
COURT OF JUSTICE HAS RELIEVED JUDGE HECTOR LARIOS OF HIS DUTIES AS
JUDGE AND NOTARY BECAUSE HE ORDERED THE RELEASE OF A BAND OF ALLEGED
KIDNAPPERS.

   THE NEW JUDGE, RICARDO MEJIA, OVERTURNED THE RULING TO RELEASE THE
EIGHT PEOPLE ACCUSED OF KIDAPPING AT LEAST SIX WEALTHY SALVADORANS IN
THE EARLY 1980'S.

   SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO ANNOUNCED
LARIOS' DISMISSAL AND SUSPENDED HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW.  "BASED
ON A REVIEW OF LARIOS' IRREGULAR RULING, ONE CAN CONCLUDE THAT HIS
BEHAVIOR IS UNBECOMING AN OFFICIAL WORTHY OF THE SUPREME COURT'S
TRUST.  WE ARE DISMAYED BY THAT JUDGE'S CONDUCT," HE NOTED.

   MOREOVER, MEJIA OVERTURNED THE RULING ORDERING THE RELEASE OF
ORLANDO LLOVERA BALLET, LIEUTENANT ISIDRO LOPEZ, MAJOR ALFREDO
JIMENEZ, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE KIDNAPPING RING.

   LARIOS DECIDED ON FRIDAY TO RELEASE THE MEMBERS OF THE KIDNAPPING
RING, WHICH INCLUDED SOME ARMY OFFICERS AND SYMPATHIZERS OF THE
RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA), WHICH WON THE 19
MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   "THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE SUPREME COURT HAS LEVIED THIS KIND OF
SANCTION IN A CASE SETTING A PRECEDENT IN JUDICIAL CORRUPTION," A
COURT OFFICIAL ASSERTED, REFERRING TO LARIOS' DISMISSAL.  LARIOS IS
ALSO ACCUSED OF RELEASING MEMBERS OF A DRUG TRAFFICKING RING SOME
YEARS AGO.

   BECAUSE THE RULING ON THE KIDNAPPERS WAS OVERTURNED, "THE CASE GOES
BACK TO THE LOWER COURTS," THE NEW JUDGE SAID.

   THE KIDNAPPERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN UNDER ARREST SINCE APRIL
1986, WERE ACCUSED OF KIDNAPPING SEVERAL BUSINESSMEN FOR HIGH SUMS OF
MONEY.

   LARIOS'S RULING IN FAVOR OF THE KIDNAPPERS PROMPTED A BITTER
REACTION FROM GOVERNMENT, POLITICAL, AND PROFESSIONAL SECTORS.  THE
NATIONAL AD COUNCIL, REPRESENTING NEWS MEDIA ANNOUNCERS, HAS URGED
THAT THE KIDNAPPERS BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW "SO
THAT THOSE WHO PROFIT FROM THE SUFFERING OF OTHERS ARE PUNISHED."

   BOGOTA, 30 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [TEXT] LAST
NIGHT'S TERRORIST TARGET WAS THE ANTIOQUIA LIQUEUR PLANT. FOUR
POWERFUL ROCKETS WERE GOING TO EXPLODE VERY CLOSE TO THE TANKS WHERE
300,000 GALLONS OF THE SO-CALLED CASTILLE CRUDE, USED TO OPERATE THE
BOILERS, IS STORED. THE WATCHMEN ON DUTY REPORTED THAT AT 2030 THEY
SAW A MAN AND A WOMAN LEAVING A SMALL SUITCASE NEAR THE FENCE THAT
SURROUNDS THE PLANT. THE WATCHMEN EXCHANGED FIRE WITH THE TERRORISTS
WHO FLED LEAVING BEHIND THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL THAT ALSO INCLUDED
DYNAMITE AND GRENADE ROCKET LAUNCHERS. METROPOLITAN POLICE PERSONNEL
SPECIALIZING IN EXPLOSIVES, DEFUSED THE ROCKETS. SOME 100 PEOPLE WERE
WORKING INSIDE THE PLANT.

   THE DAMAGE THE ROCKETS WOULD HAVE CAUSED HAD THEY BEEN ACTIVATED
CANNOT BE ESTIMATED BECAUSE THE CARIBE SODA FACTORY AND THE GUAYABAL
RESIDENTIAL AREA WOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN AFFECTED.

   THE ANTIOQUIA LIQUEUR PLANT HAS RECEIVED THREATS IN THE PAST AND
MAXIMUM SECURITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRACTICED IN THE AREA. SECURITY WAS
STEPPED UP LAST NIGHT AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE LIQUEUR INDUSTRY IS THE
LARGEST FOREIGN EXCHANGE PRODUCER FOR THE DEPARTMENT.

WITH LIEUTENANT COLONEL RICARDO WHEELOCK, CHIEF OF THE NICARAGUAN
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] HOW ABOUT THE SANDINIST
SOLDIERS THAT ALLEGEDLY [WORDS INDISTINCT].  NO SANDINIST SOLDIERS ARE
BEING HELD BY THE CREW OF THAT BOAT?

   [WHEELOCK] THAT IS WHAT I SAID.  FURTHERMORE, ONE OF THE BOATS WITH
50 CREW MEMBERS HAS SHOWN UP IN HONDURAS AND IT IS WHAT IS CAUSING
THIS PROBLEM.

   [REPORTER] THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH SOME COLOMBIANS CONCERNING
CONTRABAND, RIGHT?

   [WHEELOCK] WE ARE THERE TO PROTECT THE FISHING RESOURCES AND TO
PREVENT ANY TYPE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, GUN RUNNING OR ANY MERCHANDISE
CONTRABAND.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] HOW DID THE MUTINY OCCUR?

   [WHEELOCK] FROM THE TIME THEY WERE CAPTURED AND ON THE WAY TO CORN
ISLAND, ONE OF THE OFFICERS ON BOARD WAS CARELESS.  THEN, THE COOK AND
THE CAPTAIN DISARMED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS, TOOK AWAY HIS RIFLE, AND
THEY KILLED HIM.  THE CREW THEN AVAILED ITSELF OF THIS INCIDENT TO
RISE UP IN MUTINY.  THE CAPTAIN WAS STRANGLING ONE OF THE OFFICERS
WHEN ANOTHER OFFICER PULLED UP GUN ON HIM.  HE IS THE CAPTAIN WHO RAN
THE SHIP AGROUND IN A CORAL REEF.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE SHIPOWNERS
WILL HAVE TO PAY A FINE AND AFTER THE FINE IS PAID, THEY MUST COMPLY
WITH ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THE BOAT AND CREW ARE RETURNED TO
THEM.

   BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [EXCERPTS]
THE EXTRADITABLES TODAY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF
ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, WHICH
OCCURRED THIS MORNING IN MEDELLIN.  THE CRIMINAL ATTACK ON THE OFFICER
OCCURED A SCANT 1 MONTH AFTER THE MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT
GOVERNOR ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR.

   A POLICEMAN WAS KILLED AND ANOTHER POLICEMAN WOUNDED DURING THE
TERRORIST ATTACK.  COL QUINTERO DID NOT HAVE A POLICE ESCORT BY HIS
OWN BEHEST.  COL QUINTERO WAS DIRECTING OPERATIONS AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF DEATH THREATS.
HERE IS A REPORT BY GLADYS VARGAS FROM MEDELLIN.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VARGAS] THIS MORNING ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER
COL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO LEFT HIS RESIDENCE TO BEGIN HIS DAILY
TASKS AT ANTIOQUIA POLICE HEADQUARTERS.  AS THE VEHICLE DROVE THROUGH
THE AMERICA NEIGHBORHOOD, SEVEN BLOCKS FROM WHERE ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR
ANTONIO ROLDAN WAS KILLED, THE VEHICLE THAT COL QUINTERO WAS IN -- A
WHITE NISSAN PATROL VEHICLE WITH LICENSE PLATES ME-7847 -- DREW TO A
STOP IN FRONT OF A RED LIGHT AT THE CARRERA 80 CROSSING.  SEVERAL
INDIVIDUALS IN A GRAY MAZDA 626 VEHICLE, WITH LICENSE PLATES MI-1630,
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO FIRE VOLLEYS OF SUBMACHINEGUN
FIRE AGAINST COL QUINTERO, WHO DIED INSTANTLY.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   COL QUINTERO DID NOT HAVE A POLICE ESCORT.  JUST 8 DAYS AGO HE
DECIDED TO DISMISS THE ESCORT, BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO
BE KILLED IF THERE WERE AN ATTACK ON HIM.  ONLY COL QUINTERO AND A
POLICE DRIVER WERE IN THE VEHICLE.

   THE JUDGE OF THE 76TH DISTRICT COURT, WHO DIRECTED THE REMOVAL OF
THE BODY, SAID THAT SEVERAL TYPES OF WEAPONS WERE USED IN THE ATTACK
AND MORE THAN 100 SHOTS WERE FIRED. [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END RECORDING]

THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF FARMING, COMMERCIAL,
INDUSTRIAL, AND FINANCIAL ASSOCIATIONS, CACIF, HAS MET WITH THE ACTING
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC.  SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE
DISCLOSED THAT THEY DISCUSSED THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM PROPOSED BY THE
GOVERNMENT ON 25 AUGUST.

   ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COUNTRY'S
PRODUCTIVE SECTOR AND ACTING PRESIDENT ROBERTO CARPIO NICOLLE ALSO
DISCUSSED THE VIOLENCE PREVAILING IN THE COUNTRY AND THE WAY LAW
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES ARE COPING WITH THE PROBLEM THAT HAS ALREADY
TAKEN A TOLL ON SEVERAL VICTIMS.  NO DETAILS WERE DISCLOSED AS TO THE
MEANS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL ADOPT IN ORDER TO HALT THE WAVE OF
TERROR THAT HAS TAKEN OVER THE COUNTRY, THE SAME SOURCES DISCLOSED,
CLAIMING THAT THE MECHANISMS WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
SECURITY PLAN THAT THE ACTING PRESIDENT WILL MAKE PUBLIC IN A FEW
DAYS.

   A STATE OF SIEGE MIGHT BE IMPOSED AT ANY MOMENT, AS THIS IS ONE OF
THE ALTERNATIVES THE GOVERNMENT HAS LEFT FOR CONTROLLING VIOLENCE,
PARTICULARLY THE TERRORIST ACTIONS, SAID GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO
VALLE BALDIZAN.  THE MINISTER ADDED THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO WAIT
FOR PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TO RETURN TO THE COUNTRY.

   BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [TEXT] DIEGO
BIAFARA, ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY [DAS] AND DRUG
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY INFORMANT, WHO APPEARED BEFORE A U.S. SENATE
COMMITTEE ON 13 SEPTEMBER, REVEALED UNKNOWN LINKS BETWEEN THE ISRAELI
AND BRITISH MERCENARIES, WHO HAVE TRAINED PARAMILITARY GROUPS IN OUR
COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BIAFARA] THAT IS YAIR KLEIN IN FRONT.  HE IS THE
COLONEL WEARING THE DARK BLUE SHIRT.  THE THIN PERSON BEHIND HIM
WEARING THE LIGHT BLUE SHIRT IS TEDDY, WHO WAS THE TRANSLATOR.  THERE
WERE FIVE ISRAELI INSTRUCTORS.  I REMEMBER THE NAMES: SADAKA,
AMANCIA, YAIR, AND TEDDY.  I CANNOT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE FIFTH
ONE.  THERE WERE 11 BRITISH INSTRUCTORS.  WE USED TO CALL THAT ONE
DAVID.  THIS MAN WAS AN EXPERT IN EXPLOSIVES.  HE INSTRUCTED US ON HOW
TO USE EXPLOSIVES.  [END RECORDING]

   THESE WERE STATEMENTS MADE BY BIAFARA TO THE U.S. SENATE IN WHICH
WE LEARNED OF A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES, WHO WERE
TRAINING PARAMILITARY GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION, AND THE
BRITISH MERCENARIES WHO CAME TO THE COUNTRY ALLEGEDLY TO ASSASSINATE
PABLO ESCOBAR.

   BIAFARA KNEW BOTH GROUPS OF MERCENARIES.  ACCORDING TO HIS
STATEMENTS GIVEN TO DAS LAST MARCH, NOT ONLY DID ISRAELI MERCENARIES
TRAIN ASSASSINS IN MIDDLE MAGDALENA, THERE WAS ALSO A GROUP OF 11
BRITISH MERCENARIES, WHO GAVE LESSONS TO 50 STUDENTS.  AMONG THE
INSTRUCTORS THERE WAS PETER MCLISE, THE NAME OF ONE OF THE LEADERS
OF THE OPERATION AGAINST PABLO ESCOBAR, AND DAVID, WHO BIAFARA CLEARLY
IDENTIFIED.  HE WAS DAVID TOMKINS, THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE PLOT
AGAINST ESCOBAR.  ACCORDING TO BIAFARA, MOST BRITISH INSTRUCTORS HAD
TATOOS ON THEIR BREASTS, ARMS, AND SHOULDERS, JUST AS WE CAN SEE ON
THE VIDEO TAPED BY THE BRITISH MEN WHO PREPARED THE OPERATION AGAINST
ESCOBAR.

   IN CONCLUSION, THE MERCENARIES WHO WERE PREPARING TO ASSASSINATE
ONE OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL LEADERS WERE THE SAME ONES WHO TRAINED THE
ASSASSINS PAID BY THE CARTEL ITSELF.

REPORTS TO THE CITIZENS IN GENERAL THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN REPELLED BY OUR
COURAGEOUS SOLDIERS AND THAT THERE ARE NOW ONLY A FEW DISPERSED GROUPS
OF CRIMINALS WHO ARE LOOTING. THE ARMED FORCES REPORT THAT IN DUE TIME
THEY WILL ANNOUNCE STATISTICS ON THE CASUALTIES INFLICTED BY THE
TERRORISTS AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, AS WELL AS THE MEMBERS OF
THE ARMY WHO HAVE FALLEN IN THE LINE OF THEIR SACRED AND
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY.  IN DUE TIME, THE ARMED FORCES WILL ANNOUNCE THE
NUMBER OF TERRORISTS KILLED IN THEIR EFFORTS TO BRING SORROW AND
MOURNING TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THE ARMED FORCES ALSO REQUEST THAT THE PEOPLE FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS
AT THE MILITARY CHECKPOINTS THROUGH WHICH THEY MUST PASS IN ORDER TO
PREVENT ANY UNNECESSARY INCIDENTS. THE ARMED FORCES ALSO CALL ON THE
PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM.

   IN THE LOYAL FULFILLMENT OF THEIR DUTIES, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE
REPUBLIC ARE DETERMINED TO CARRY OUT THIS STRUGGLE SO THAT DEMOCRACY
WILL NOT BE HINDERED BY THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS, WHO IN RECENT HOURS
HAVE BROUGHT MORE SORROW, MOURNING, AND GRIEF TO THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT]
ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION:

   TODAY, 9 MARCH, WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE SIGNED BY THE MEMBERS OF
YOUR COMMISSION ASKING US TO BEGIN THE PEACE TALKS.  WE HAVE ALREADY
ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, EXPRESSING OUR WILLINGNESS
TO HOLD A MEETING.  THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION'S LETTER MAKES NO MENTION
OF ANY MOVE TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS.  IT DOES NOT EVEN CONSIDER
INCLUDING THIS TOPIC ON THE MEETING'S AGENDA.  ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS
CLEAR THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY DECIDED TO HOLD THE ELECTIONS ON
19 MARCH.

   CONSEQUENTLY, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]
HEREBY INFORMS THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE OF
THE FOLLOWING:

   1. THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION MUST CLEARLY AND PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE
THAT IT IS WILLING TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON CONFINING THE ARMY TO ITS
BARRACKS ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTIONS, ESTABLISHING AN ELECTORAL CODE
BY CONSENSUS, PROVIDING ABSENTEE VOTING FOR SALVADORANS LIVING ABROAD,
RESTRUCTURING THE CENTRAL ELECTIONS COUNCIL, AND FORMING A COUNCIL FOR
VERIFICATION.

   MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT MUST EXPRESS THE STATE POWERS' WILLINGNESS TO
POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS FOR 5 MONTHS, ONCE A CEASE-FIRE HAS BEEN AGREED
UPON.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION MUST PUBLICLY
ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS WILLING TO BRING MILITARY COMMANDERS AND OFFICERS
RESPONSIBLE FOR POLITICAL MURDERS AND CRIMES TO TRIAL, TO REDUCE THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES TO THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IT HAD IN 1968, AND TO
DISBAND THE SECURITY FORCES TO FORM A NEW CIVIL POLICE.  WE REITERATE
OUR WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS PERMANENTLY CEASING THE ARMED STRUGGLE.

   2. IF THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AGREES TO THE ABOVE REQUESTS, THE
FMLN WILL AGREE TO A MEETING AND IS WILLING TO IMMEDIATELY DECIDE ON A
DATE AND A TIME FOR THE MEETING.  THE FMLN IS EVEN WILLING TO HOLD THE
MEETING OUTSIDE EL SALVADOR.  AS A PART OF THIS MEETING, WE ARE WILLING
TO NEGOTIATE AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ARMED FORCES STAFF ON A
CEASE-FIRE THAT WILL BRING ABOUT A PERMANENT AND NEGOTIATED SOLUTION
TO THE CONFLICT.

   3. IF NO SUCH AGREEMENT IS REACHED, THEN THERE IS NO POINT IN
HOLDING THE MEETING PRIOR TO 19 MARCH, BECAUSE IT WILL SIMPLY BE USED
BY BOTH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] AND THE NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] IN THEIR ELECTION DISPUTE.  THE ELECTIONS
PLAY NO ROLE IN ACHIEVING PEACE; THEY ONLY SERVE TO PROVIDE A FALSE
JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUING THE WAR.

   4. WE AWAIT A RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION.

   SANTIAGO, 18 MAY 90 (RADIO COOPERATIVA NETWORK) -- [REPORT] [JUAN
ARAYA] [TEXT] EDMUNDO VARGAS CARRENO, CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTRY UNDER
SECRETARY, HAS STATED THAT THE BRYANT TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES
WILL BE APPLIED IN THE LETELIER CASE ONLY TO COMPENSATE THE RELATIVES
OF THE FORMER CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER MURDERED IN WASHINGTON AND THE
RELATIVES OF HIS U.S. SECRETARY, RONNIE MOFFIT.  THE CHILEAN FOREIGN
UNDER SECRETARY MADE THIS STATEMENT IN REPLY TO U.S. NEWSPAPER REPORTS
STATING THAT THE TREATY WOULD BE PARTIALLY RESPECTED.

   FOLLOWING ARE VARGAS CARRENO'S STATEMENTS AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HE
HELD IN BUENOS AIRES BEFORE CONCLUDING HIS OFFICIAL VISIT TO
ARGENTINA:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VARGAS] THIS TREATY [WORDS INDISTINCT] USED BY THE
UNITED STATES IN 1989, DURING THE PAST ADMINISTRATION, TO SOLVE TWO
PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE LETELIER CASE: THE PROBLEM OF COMPENSATION
AND THE PROBLEM OF THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
DEATH OF ORLANDO LETELIER AND HIS [WORDS INDISTINCT] ASSISTANT.

   IT HAS BEEN AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO USE THE TREATY EXCLUSIVELY TO
SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF COMPENSATION; THAT IS THE OBJECTIVE WHEN WE REFER
TO ITS PARTIAL USE.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] SO AS FOR THE COMPENSATION
SUBJECT, IT WILL BE USED.  WE ARE USING THE MECHANISM CREATED BY THE
FIVE-MEMBER COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY THE TREATY. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS
TREATY WAS PERTINENT FOR THE EARLY DECADES OF THIS CENTURY BUT IS NO
LONGER IN KEEPING WITH CURRENT INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES.  [END
RECORDING]

   DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH ARGENTINE AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS,
VARGAS CARRENO ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM WILL VISIT
CHILE IN AUGUST IN RESPONSE TO AN INVITATION FROM CHILEAN PRESIDENT
PATRICIO AYLWIN, WHO WILL ALSO VISIT ARGENTINA AT AN AS YET
UNDETERMINED DATE.

   VARGAS CARRENO NOTED HIS SATISFACTION WITH HIS MEETINGS IN BUENOS
AIRES WITH FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO AND RAUL CARIGNANO, UNDER
SECRETARY FOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS.  VARGAS CARRENO SAID THAT AS A
RESULT OF THIS INITIAL CONTACT THE BINATIONAL COMMISSION ESTABLISHED
BY THE CHILEAN-ARGENTINE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY, WHICH WAS SIGNED
IN 1984, WILL MEET NEXT JULY.  HE SAID THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES WILL
CONTINUE TO HOLD FORMAL AND INFORMAL TALKS TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS OF
COMMON INTEREST, SPEED UP THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, AND INCREASE MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.

   REGARDING THE SITUATION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILEAN
CITIZENS LIVING IN ARGENTINA -- A TOTAL HE ESTIMATED AT 800,000 --
VARGAS CARRENO SAID THAT PRESIDENT AYLWIN'S GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED
AN OFFICE TO HELP THOSE CITIZENS LIVING ABROAD FOR VARIOUS REASONS TO
RETURN TO CHILE, ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING IN ARGENTINA'S PATAGONIA
REGION WHO ARE BEING TREATED INHUMANELY, ESPECIALLY BY BUSINESSMEN IN
THE BORDER AREA, AS REPORTED BY AN ARGENTINE JOURNALIST.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] LEFTIST GUERRILLAS EARLY
TUESDAY ATTACKED A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR
WHERE MANY GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY LEADERS HAVE THEIR HOMES.

   THE DIN OF GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS COULD BE HEARD BEFORE DAWN IN THE
ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE SHERATON HOTEL.

   IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE FARABUNDO MARTI [NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] (FMLN) LAUNCHED THEIR OFFENSIVE 11 DAYS GO THAT
FIGHTING HAD SPREAD TO THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS AT THE FOOT
OF THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO.

   AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS FLEW OVER THE AREA AND THE SOUND OF

   LIMA, 20 DEC 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [EXCERPT] THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH HAS CALLED A SPECIAL SESSION OF CONGRESS FOR TOMORROW AND THE
NEXT DAY TO CONSIDER THE SERIOUS SITUATION OF PANAMA AND TO DENOUNCE
THE INTER-AMERICAN RECIPROCAL ASSISTANCE TREATY, TIAR, FOR ITS
INEFFECTIVENESS.  THIS WAS ANNOUNCED BY PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AT THE
CONCLUSION OF A COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE
TODAY.  THE PRESIDENT ALSO EXPRESSED HIS SURPRISE OVER THE MILDNESS
WITH WHICH THE REST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE REACTED TO
THE U.S. AGGRESSION AGAINST PANAMA.  PRESIDENT GARCIA ALSO SAID THAT
THE FUEL PRICE INCREASE WILL ALLOW PETROPERU [STATE PETROLEUM AGENCY]
TO OPERATE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] WHAT IMPORTANT SUBJECTS
WERE DISCUSSED IN THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING TODAY?

   [GARCIA] THE MAIN SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO CALL A SPECIAL
CONGRESSIONAL SESSION ON 22 AND 23 DECEMBER TO CONSIDER THE SERIOUS
SITUATION CREATED BY THE U.S. INVASION IN PANAMA.  THE SECOND
IMPORTANT SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO DENOUNCE THE TIAR, A MILITARY
ORGANIZATION THAT GROUPS ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND THE
UNITED STATES AND WHICH, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HAS PROVED TO BE
ABSOLUTELY INEFFECTIVE AND PARTIAL.

   THE MALVINAS ISLANDS SITUATION IS A GOOD EXAMPLE.  ACCORDING TO THE
TIAR, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED ARGENTINA, BUT IT DID
EXACTLY THE CONTRARY, SUPPORTING THE UNITED KINGDOM.

   NOW, IN THIS CASE WITH PANAMA, THE TIAR HAS NOT SERVED ANY PURPOSE.
RATHER, IT HAS SERVED TO MASK THE U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.  THEREFORE,
SINCE WE CONSIDER THE TIAR TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND SENSELESS, WE, AS A
REPUBLIC, MUST DENOUNCE IT.  WE MUST WITHDRAW OUR SIGNATURE FROM THE
TIAR.  THIS MUST BE DONE THROUGH CONGRESS, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE
CALLED A SPECIAL SESSION.

   [REPORTER] SEVERAL SECTORS HAVE DESCRIBED THE DECISION TO WITHDRAW
THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES AS A HASTY DECISION.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

   [GARCIA] I THINK THAT THOSE MUST BE SECTORS COMMITTED TO THE
INVASION.  THEY MUST SUPPORT A RIGHTIST CONCEPT BY WHICH THE UNITED
STATES HAS THE HEGEMONIC RIGHT TO SAFEGUARD OUR DESTINY AND TO DECIDE
WHO CAN GOVERN US AND WHO CANNOT.

   AS PERUVIANS AND LATIN AMERICANS, WE FEEL THAT THE AGGRESSIVE AND
BLOODY ACTION BY U.S. TROOPS TO OCCUPY A SMALL COUNTRY IS A VIOLATION.
THERE ARE CURRENTLY NEARLY 30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS IN PANAMANIAN
TERRITORY.  THEY HAVE KILLED MANY PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO IMPOSE A NEW
GOVERNMENT.  THUS, AS LONG AS THOSE TROOPS REMAIN THERE, AS LONG AS
THIS VIOLATION TO LATIN AMERICA IS MAINTAINED, OUR AMBASSADOR WILL NOT
STAY IN THAT COUNTRY.  THIS DOES NOT IMPLY A BREAK IN RELATIONS; IT
REPRESENTS A CLEAR GESTURE OF CONDEMNATION AND DISLIKE.

   AS LONG AS A U.S. SOLDIER VIOLATES THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, WE WILL
KEEP OUR AMBASSADOR HERE.  AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT
WITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS AND PANAMA REMAINS OCCUPIED, THE PANAMANIAN AND
PERUVIAN FLAGS WILL REMAIN TOGETHER.

   [REPORTER] DON'T YOU THINK THAT THIS ATTITUDE COULD HARM CERTAIN
RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES; THAT IS, COULDN'T IT JEOPARDIZE THE
IMF LOAN?

   [GARCIA] NOT AT ALL.  THESE ARE TWO ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT THINGS.
THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF ARE ONE THING; THE INTERNATIONAL
POLITICAL ATTITUDE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT ABUSES ITS ECONOMIC AND
MILITARY POWER WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IS SOMETHING ELSE.

   BESIDES, WE SHOULD MENTION SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.  AS FOR
PANAMANIAN-U.S. RELATIONS, THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THE MAIN
ACCOMPLICES IN DEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY.  WHEN ELECTIONS TOOK
PLACE IN 1984, WHEN ARNULFO ARIAS SHOULD HAVE WON, THE UNITED STATES
DECIDED THAT IT WAS NOT CONVENIENT THAT ARIAS SHOULD WIN, SO A LARGE
FRAUD -- AS IT WAS DECLARED AT THE TIME -- WAS CARRIED OUT TO PLACE
NICOLAS ARDITO BARLETTA IN POWER.  THE FIRST ONES TO RECOGNIZE ARDITO
WERE THE AMERICANS.  ARDITO WAS PLACED IN THE PRESIDENCY BY NORIEGA.

   IN 1985 NORIEGA REMOVED ARDITO AND PUT ERIC ARTURO DEL VALLE IN HIS
PLACE.  THE AMERICANS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED DEL VALLE AS PRESIDENT.
THEREFORE, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN NORIEGA'S ACCOMPLICE IN
DEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY.  WE DENOUNCED THIS.  NORIEGA IS A
CREATION OF THE UNITED STATES.  IT HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN SAID THAT
NORIEGA WORKED WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WITH THE U.S.  CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS ONCE CHIEF.

   THEREFORE, NOW THAT THE MAID IS ANSWERING BACK, MAKING CLAIMS TO
THE PANAMA CANAL AND WANTING TO BECOME INDEPENDENT FROM THE UNITED
STATES, THE UNITED STATES SUDDENLY DISCOVERS THAT SHE IS A DRUG
TRAFFICKER AND THAT SHE DOES NOT SERVE ITS INTERESTS, SO THEY SEND
30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS TO PANAMA.  THIS IS AN ABUSE.  IT IS A VIOLATION
OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ANOTHER STATE.

   NO HONORABLE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY SHOULD TOLERATE THIS INVASION
WITHOUT ACTIVELY AND OPENLY CONDEMNING IT.  ONE WAY TO CONDEMN IT AND
EXPRESS DISAPPROVAL OF IT IS TO SAY THAT AS LONG AS THE TROOPS
INVADING LATIN AMERICA REMAIN, WE DO NOT NEED TO MAINTAIN OUR
AMBASSADOR THERE.  [CONTINUED]

   LIMA, 29 MAR 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT (MRTA), A PERUVIAN GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION, HAS SENT A LETTER
TO PERUVIAN CARDINAL JUAN LANDAZURI, PROPOSING THAT A DIALOGUE BE HELD
TO RESTORE PEACE TO PERU.

   IN ITS LETTER, WHICH IS PARTIALLY PUBLISHED IN TODAY'S LA
REPUBLICA, A LIMA NEWSPAPER, THE MRTA OUTLINES SEVERAL CONDITIONS
UNDER WHICH IT WILL HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.

   THE MRTA LETTER IS DATED 26 MARCH, THE SAME DAY CARDINAL LANDAZURI
STATED OVER A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION THAT THE CHURCH WOULD BE
WILLING TO MEDIATE WITH VIOLENCE-ORIENTED MOVEMENTS UNDER ACCEPTABLE
CONDITIONS FOR DIALOGUE.

   THE CARDINAL ADDED THAT, BECAUSE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE IDEOLOGIES,
THESE MOVEMENTS HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY DIALOGUE WHATSOEVER.  HE ALSO
NOTED THAT APPEALS MADE BY THE CHURCH HAVE GONE UNHEEDED.

   ACCORDING TO LA REPUBLICA, THE MRTA LETTER SAYS THAT THE MRTA
"NATIONAL LEADERSHIP CAREFULLY LISTENED TO YOUR EASTER MESSAGE TO THE
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IN WHICH YOU REFLECTED ON THE PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE
IN THE COUNTRY, AND MADE AN APPEAL TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE
TAKEN UP ARMS."

   THUS, THE LETTER ADDS, THE MRTA "DEEMS IT IMPORTANT TO INFORM YOU
OF OUR OPINION AND OUR PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD."

   THE LETTER SAYS THAT THE CHURCH MUST PLAY A DECISIVE ROLE IN
"HUMANIZING THIS WAR," AND THAT MOST VICTIMS OF THIS WAR ARE "UNARMED
CIVILIANS."

   THE MRTA BELIEVES THAT IN ORDER TO HUMANIZE THIS CONFLICT THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES MUST "STOP COMMITTING CRIMES AGAINST
UNARMED CIVILIANS, PRISONERS MUST BE TREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
VIENNA CONVENTION, TORTURE AND HUMAN RIGHTS' CRIMES MUST END, AND
PARAMILITARY GANGS MUST BE DISMANTLED."

   THE MRTA ASKS THE CHURCH TO DEMAND THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT
CHANGE ITS ECONOMIC POLICY.

   THE MRTA SAYS: "THE CHURCH MUST DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT PUT AN
END TO REPRESSION AND CRIMES AGAINST THE PEOPLE; THAT HIGH MORAL
STANDARDS BE OBSERVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF PERUVIAN POLITICAL LIFE; AND
THAT STIFF PUNISHMENT BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO COMMIT IMMORAL, CRIMINAL
ACTS AGAINST THE PEOPLE."

   THE MRTA LETTER CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT ONLY THIS WAY WILL THE
CHURCH TRULY "CONTRIBUTE TO FINDING A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFRONTATION."

   MONSIGNOR RICARDO DURAND FLORES, PRESIDENT OF THE PERUVIAN
EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, TODAY SAID THAT THE CHURCH "CANNOT REJECT ANY
PROPOSAL FROM VIOLENCE-ORIENTED ORGANIZATIONS."

   MSGR DURAND SAID THAT IF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS MADE THE EPISCOPAL
CONFERENCE WILL IMMEDIATELY CALL A MEETING OF ITS STANDING COMMITTEE
"TO STUDY THE SITUATION."

   VICTOR POLAY, ONE OF THE MRTA'S LEADERS, IS CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY
AND FACING TRIAL ON CHARGES OF TERRORISM.

   MORE THAN 13,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN PERU SINCE 1980, WHEN THE
MAOIST SHINING PATH ORGANIZATION STARTED ITS WAVE OF POLITICAL
VIOLENCE, WHICH HAS ALSO CAUSED HEAVY MATERIAL DAMAGE.


TST1-MUC3-0015

   GUATEMALA CITY, 30 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS
TODAY PROPOSED "BEGINNING A DIALOGUE PROCESS AND TALKS" AMONG THE
VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY TO TRY AND PUT AN END TO "REPRESSION,
TERROR, AND VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO BEGIN A REAL DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS."

   THE GUATEMALAN REBELS PROPOSED HOLDING "MEETINGS ON DATES TO BE
AGREED UPON AND IN A COUNTRY THAT WILL GUARANTEE THE NECESSARY SAFETY
AND OFFER ITS TERRITORY TO HOLD THE MEETINGS" TO DISCUSS "VITAL"
ISSUES, SUCH AS HOW TO END THE REPRESSION AND THE INTERNAL ARMED
CONFLICT.

   THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG) HAS ALSO
REITERATED TO CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT VINICIO CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT ITS
WILLINGNESS TO ATTEND A DIALOGUE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON A
CEASE-FIRE; HOWEVER, IT REGRETS THE FACT THAT UP TO NOW, "THE
PRESIDENT AND HIS DEFENSE MINISTER, GENERAL ALEJANDRO GRAMAJO, HAVE
REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION."

   GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND URNG REPRESENTATIVES MET FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN MADRID, SPAIN, IN 1987, BUT THE MEETING ENDED WITHOUT SPECIFIC
AGREEMENTS BEING REACHED.

   "WE HAVE INSISTED ON A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE URNG
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN THOUGH ALL OF CENTRAL AMERICA IS WILLING TO
HOLD DIALOGUES, PRESIDENT CEREZO AND THE GRAMAJO CLIQUE REFUSE TO DO
SO," THE URNG STATED IN A PAID ADVERTISEMENT PUBLISHED IN LOCAL
NEWSPAPERS.

   IN REFERENCE TO THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE THAT IS SWEEPING THE COUNTRY,
THE URNG, MADE UP OF FOUR REBEL GROUPS THAT OPERATE IN GUATEMALA, SAID
THAT THE PEOPLE "ARE LIVING ONE OF THE DARKEST AND DEADLIEST CHAPTERS
IN THEIR HISTORY."

   WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND "FEELS THAT IT IS
NECESSARY TO UNDERTAKE A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND TALKS WITH ALL THE
FORCES AND POLITICAL PARTIES, WITH ALL THE POPULAR, RELIGIOUS,
BUSINESS GROUPS, AND WITH THE HONEST SOLDIERS, SO THAT TOGETHER WE CAN
FIND A REAL ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT SITUATION."

   "THE ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED COULD INCLUDE -- IN ADDITION TO THE
VITAL ISSUES LIKE REPRESSION AND THE INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT --
ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT, WITHOUT
PRESSURES OR IMF MEASURES, OF A PROSPEROUS ECONOMY," THE GUERRILLA'S
STATEMENT ADDS.

   "WITH 16 MONTHS AND A FEW DAYS LEFT IN THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL
TERM, PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS
PROMISES AND HAS ONLY MADE THE SITUATION WORSE," THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE
STATES.

   "INSTEAD OF CHANGES, REPRESSION, TERROR, INSTABILITY, CHAOS, AND
CORRUPTION CONTINUE, AND THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN AN
ENVIRONMENT OF LIES, FRUSTRATION, AND MANIPULATION," THE REBELS ADD.

   THE URNG STATED THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT, THE FIRST CIVILIAN
GOVERNMENT THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY HAS HAD SINCE 1970, HAS
PROVEN ITSELF TO BE "A COUNTERINSURGENT, REPRESSIVE, AND TERRORIST
REGIME."

   THE GUATEMALAN REBELS BELIEVE THAT "THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEW WAVE OF REPRESSION AND TERROR THAT ONLY ADDS
TO THE MORE THAN 100,000 PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED, 40,000 WHO
HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED OR ARE MISSING, 1 MILLION LOCALLY DISPLACED AND
46,000 WHO HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN MEXICO SINCE 1954."

   THE URNG TODAY ALSO PUBLISHED A COPY OF A LETTER SENT TO UN
SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR IN WHICH IT REQUESTS THAT HE
OFFER HIS GOOD OFFICES "SO THAT A REGIME THAT RESPECTS HUMAN RIGHTS,
THE INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND CONVENTIONS, JUSTICE, FREEDOM, AND
DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL IN GUATEMALA."

   THE REBELS SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S ASSURANCE THAT THE REBEL
MOVEMENT HAS BEEN ANNIHILATED "IS NOT TRUE" AND ADDED THAT, QUITE THE
CONTRARY, "THE POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY WAR HAS INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY."

   THE URNG CLAIMS THAT "THE URNG MILITARY GROUPS ARE NOW FIGHTING IN
11 OF THE 22 DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING GUATEMALA
CITY," AND HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS ON "IMPORTANT
TARGETS."  ACCORDING TO ITS MILITARY REPORT, THE URNG HAS CARRIED OUT
APPROXIMATELY 688 MILITARY ACTIONS AND INFLICTED 1,172 CASUALTIES ON
THE ARMY SINCE LAST APRIL.

   THE GUATEMALAN ARMY CLAIMS THAT THE REBELS HAVE BEEN MILITARILY
DEFEATED AND THAT ONLY ABOUT 1,000 REBELS ARE ACTIVE IN SOME ISOLATED
REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.

   TODAY'S STATEMENT WAS SIGNED BY ROLANDO MORAN, GASPAR ILOM, CARLOS
GONZALEZ, AND PABLO MONSANTO, COMMANDERS OF THE FOUR CLANDESTINE
ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAKE UP THE URNG: THE POOR PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY
(EGP), THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS (ORPA),
THE GUATEMALAN LABOR PARTY (PGT-COMMUNIST), AND THE REBEL ARMED FORCES
(FAR).  


TST1-MUC3-0016

   CLANDESTINE, 23 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] THE OFFICERS AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ARMY MUST THINK THIS
OVER.  THEY CANNOT CONTINUE CLOSING THEIR EYES TO THE BOMBINGS, TO THE
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THE POOR NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN
SALVADOR, TO THE MOTHERS WHO APPEAR CRYING ON TELEVISION.  IT IS GOOD
THAT THE NETWORK PRESENTS THESE PICTURES OF PEOPLE CRYING,
MANIPULATING THEIR EMOTIONS.  THOSE TEARS WERE SHED OVER 50 YEARS OF
OPPRESSION AND MISERY, AND OVER THE BOMBINGS THAT HAVE DESTROYED
ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.  OFFICERS, THE BOMBS HAVE CAUSED ALL THAT SORROW
AND THE DESTRUCTION OF 500 HOUSES IN ZACAMIL.

   AS WE WERE SAYING, OFFICERS, YOU MUST ASK YOURSELVES: WHO ARE YOU
DYING FOR?  FOR COLONEL PONCE'S MANSIONS IN MIAMI?  FOR GENERAL
BUSTILLO'S MANSIONS?  WHY ARE THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS DYING HERE?
WHY ARE THE LIEUTENANTS, THE CAPITAINS DYING, WHILE THE MEMBERS OF THE
ARMED FORCES HIERARCHY ARE CONFORTABLY SITTING IN THEIR
AIR-CONDITIONED OFFICES BEING GUARDED WHILE THEY ARE AT EASE, BUT NOT
REALLY AT EASE AS COMBAT IS TAKING PLACE JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM THEIR
OFFICE.

   OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS, CAPTAINS, THIS IS THE APPEAL THE FMLN WANTS
MAKE TO YOU TODAY, AT A TIME WHEN THE FUTURE OF THE FATHERLAND IS AT
STAKE?  YOU MUST THINK THIS OVER, YOU MUST MAKE A DECISION, AND YOU
MUST DO THIS SOON.  HISTORY IS MOVING FAST, AND THE TIME IS RIPE. SO
WHEN YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION, THINK ABOUT
WHAT WE ARE TELLING YOU.  IF YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION, THINK
ABOUT WHAT WE ARE SAYING.  IF WE ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION HERE,
WHY IS THIS CONSTITUTION BEING VIOLATED BY THOSE RAMBOS SENT BY
PRESIDENT BUSH TO EL SALVADOR?  YOU ALL KNOW THIS LITTLE GROUP OF
RAMBOS IS GOOD FOR NOTHING, AS THEY ARE COWARDS.  THEY DID NOT WANT TO
LEAVE THE SHERATON HOTEL, BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS WERE THERE.  THEY ARE
COWARDS, JUST LIKE THEIR SYSTEM.  THEY ARE TINHORN RAMBOS, WHO ARE
ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD.

   AS WE SAID YESTERDAY, IF THOSE MEN WHO LEFT THE SHERATON LIKE
COMMON CRIMINALS COVERING THEIR FACES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS ARE
THE ONES WHO ARE TRAINING THE ARMED FORCES, WE CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER
WHY THE FMLN IS DEFEATING THE TACTICS TAUGHT BY THEM.  THEY ARE NO
GOOD, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND OUR PEOPLE, THEY UNDERESTIMATE
OUR PEOPLE.  OFFICERS, YOU KNOW THOSE U.S.  ADVISERS UNDERESTIMATE
YOU, THEY LOOK DOWN ON YOU, AS LITTLE INDIANS, AS DONKEYS.  YOU KNOW
HOW THEY THINK OF YOU.  YOU KOW THEY MOCK THE SALVADORAN OFFICERS.
OFFICERS, YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW THESE U.S.  ADVISERS TREAT OUR
SOLDIERS.  THEY ARE HAUGHTY, ARROGANT, AND COWARDS.  YOU SAW THEM AT
THE SHERATON HOTEL, PISSING IN THEIR PANTS, THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE
THE HOTEL.  A COMMISSION WENT THERE, THE RED CROSS WENT THERE, BUT
THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SURE OF THEMSELVES
DURING THE TRUCE, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE COWARDS.

   WE WANT THE CIN [NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER], THAT FASCIST
NETWORK THAT IS SILENCING OUR PEOPLE, TO PRESENT THE FILMS OF THE
ADVISORS LEAVING THE HOTEL.  WE CHALLENGE THE NETWORK TO PRESENT THOSE
FILMS OF THE ADVISORS LEAVING THE SHERATON, WITH THEIR FACES COVERED
AS IF THEY WERE CAR THIEVES.  THAT IS THE WAY THE U.S.  ADVISERS --
THE RAMBOS, THE SUPERMEN -- LEFT THE SHERATON.  THESE RAMBOS ARE NOT
GOING TO SAVE ANYONE, AS THEY CANNOT EVEN SAVE THEMSELVES.

   CLANDESTINE, 12 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, GENERAL COMMAND]
[TEXT] THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND REPORTS:

   1.  ON SATURDAY 11 NOVEMBER WE BEGAN THE NATIONAL MILITARY CAMPAIGN
CALLED " OUT WITH THE FASCISTS!  FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES!" THIS CAMPAIGN
IMMERSED THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND AND THE CRISTIANI
ADMINISTRATION IN CONFUSION AND INSECURITY SINCE THE BEGINNING; AND IT
SUCCESSFULLY CONTINUES IN ITS SECOND DAY OF FIGHTING.

   2.  THE FMLN FIGHTERS ARE USING ALL THEIR INTELLIGENCE, ENERGY,
UNSELFISHNESS, AND PATRIOTISM SO THAT A JUST PEACE IS ACHIEVED IN THE
COUNTRY BASED ON AN AUTHENTIC DEMOCRACY DESIGNED TO COUNTER THE
GENOCIDAL REPLY THAT THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP HAS RESPONDED WITH.

   3.  SALVADORANS WHO HAVE WITHSTOOD A BLOODY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP
FOR ALMOST 60 YEARS SEE MORE CLEARLY TODAY THE NEED TO DEVELOP THEIR
LEGITIMATE DEFENSE AGAINST THE REPRESSION WHICH HAS BEEN STEPPED UP BY
THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MILITARY HOSTILITY OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S
ADMINISTRATION; AND THEY UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO SUPPORT AND JOIN THE
STRUGGLE FOR OUR COUNTRY'S LIBERTY.

   4.  WE URGE THE HONEST AND PATRIOTIC MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES TO
SERIOUSLY REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY FACING THE
GUERRILLA ARMY OF THE FMLN, BUT A WHOLE SECTOR WHICH CLAIMS ITS RIGHT
TO REBEL.  WE SPECIFICALLY URGE THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS IN THE
BATTLEFIELD TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR STRUGGLE IS NOT BEING PERSONALLY
WAGED AGAINST YOU, BUT RATHER AGAINST THE ANTIPOPULAR INTERESTS WHICH
ARE BEING DEFENDED BY THE ARMED FORCES UPON ORDERS FROM THE FASCISTS.

   5.  THE GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLES OF THE WORLD ARE CLOSELY FOLLOWING
THE LATEST EVENTS IN EL SALVADOR AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION WILL BE
VALUABLE IN ACHIEVING A NATIONAL CONSENSUS BASED ON DEMOCRACY, A
SOLUTION AMONG SALVADORANS, AND NO FOREIGN INTERVENTION.  THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST HELP ACHIEVE A JUST AND DURABLE PEACE,
THUS AVOIDING MORE BLOODSHED.

   6.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND WANTS TO REPORT THE ATROCITIES BEING
PERPETRATED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY THE ARMED FORCES WHO
ARE INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR,
AND ISSUING DEATH THREATS AGAINST ALL THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS,
THUS PROVING THE REGIME'S WEAKNESS AND SHOWING ITS ANTIPOPULAR AND
ANTIPATRIOTIC ESSENCE.

   7.  WE ALSO URGE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP CREATE SPECIAL
ZONES WHERE CHILDREN, THE ELDERLY, AND WOUNDED PEOPLE FROM THE BATTLE
ZONES CAN BE EVACUATED.

   OUT WITH THE FASCISTS!  FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES!

TST1-MUC3-0018

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 MAY 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] TO DATE, THE
ARMY HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF A REPORT THAT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT HAS
SAID IT SENT TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE INVESTIGATIONS
CARRIED OUT IN THAT COUNTRY CONCERNING THE DEATH OF SALVADORAN LEFTIST
LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES.

   OQUELI, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) AND
HILDA FLORES, A GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER WERE ABDUCTED AND
KILLED IN JANUARY BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN GUATEMALA CITY AS
THEY WERE HEADING TO THE LA AURORA AIRPORT.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO WAS IN CARACAS ON THE OCCASION OF THE MEETING
BETWEEN THE FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT -
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT] AND A DELEGATION OF THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT.  ON THAT OCCASION PRESIDENT CEREZO MET WITH BOTH
DELEGATIONS SEPARATELY.  HE INFORMED THEM ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS
BEING CONDUCTED CONCERNING THE CRIME AND TOLD THEM THAT HE WOULD SEND
HIS GOVERNMENT'S VERSION TO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.

   SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT "SALVADORAN RIGHTIST
SECTORS AND SOLDIERS" COULD BE IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME, YESTERDAY ARMY
SPOKESMEN WERE ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE SUBJECT.  THEY SAID THAT
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HEARD SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT, THEY HAVE NO
SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE REPORT, WHICH THEY EXPECT TO SEE SOON, IF
IT IS NOT JUST SPECULATION.


TST1-MUC3-0019

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 JAN 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT]
[MAURICIO FUNES] [TEXT] AFTER NEARLY A 2-MONTH ABSENCE FROM THE
NATIONAL PRESS, MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON HOLDS THE VIEW THAT THE
ARMED FORCES SHOULD NOT BE CRITICIZED FOR THE ISOLATED BEHAVIOR OF
SOME OF ITS MEMBERS.  THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]
LEADER IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES WERE THE
ONES THAT EXERTED PRESSURE SO THAT THE JESUITS' MURDER CASE COULD BE
CLEARED-UP.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] IT WAS NOT THE INSTITUTION [ARMED
FORCES] THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM.  REGRETTABLY SOME OF ITS
MEMBERS DID IT AND NOW THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES ARE UNDER PRESSURE FOR
POLITICAL REASONS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE THAT IT IS THANKS TO THE
ARMED FORCES THAT WE HAVE THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WITH A HOPE THAT
OUR COUNTRY DEVELOPS AND RECOVERS.  IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT SOME PEOPLE
PASS JUDGMENT OR CRITICIZE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN
ON ALL THE OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WHO HAVE HAD
TO PUT UP WITH THESE ATTACKS IN ADDITION TO THE INTENSE WORK THEY HAVE
HAD FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. [END RECORDING]

   D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT ONCE THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS HAS BEEN
CLEARED UP, U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION THE
CONTINUATION OF U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] THE JESUITS' CASE WAS A DETERMINING
FACTOR.  BUT NOW THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN FULLY SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF
THE FBI, SCOTLAND YARD, AND INVESTIGATORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, THIS
IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SERIOUS.  I DO NOT
BELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANY DOUBT NOW ABOUT RECEIVING THE AID, ESPECIALLY
AFTER THE TREMENDOUS OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE, IF THE SITUATION DID
ARISE [WHEREBY AID WAS SUSPENDED], THIS WOULD ONLY FAVOR THE FMLN.  I
KNOW THE FMLN HAS A WHOLE RANGE OF SUPPORT GROUPS THAT HANDLE
DISINFORMATION AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THINGS HERE WERE DISASTROUS.
FOR EXAMPLE, INFORMATION ABROAD IS THAT THE AIR FORCE LEVELED ALL THE
NEIGHBORHOODS.  WE SALVADORANS KNOW THAT THE AIR FORCE WAS EXCESSIVELY
CAUTIOUS AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPELLING THIS ATTACK WITH A MINIMUM
OF CIVILIANS WOUNDED.  FOR THAT MATTER, IF WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE
THINGS, U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS IN PANAMA WERE MORE CLUMSY -- THERE
THEY SET A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ON FIRE. [END RECORDING]

   THE ARENA LEADER ALSO DENIED THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIMSELF.  ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS
AGENCIES, THE DECISION OF THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TO PROSECUTE THE
MILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS' MURDER CAUSED DIVISION WITHIN
THE PARTY.  D'AUBUISSON DENIED THIS WAS TRUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] NOT IN THE LEAST.  THERE HAVE NEVER
BEEN ANY DIFFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.  ON THE CONTRARY, WE
ARE VERY CLOSE AND GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT EFFORT, WORK, AND THE
MAGNIFICENT JOB PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS DOING.  THIS IS REASON FOR
PRIDE NOT ONLY AMONG FRIENDS OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BUT FOR THE PARTY
AND FRIENDS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. [END RECORDING]

   IN COMMENTING ON THE DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN, D'AUBUISSON SUPPORTED
PRESIDENT CRITIANI'S INITIATIVE OF ENGAGING THE ASSISTANCE OF THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] I DO NOT THINK HE HAS THE TIME TO
ACT AS MEDIATOR; HOWEVER, HE COULD ACT AS A GUARANTOR, RECEIVING
RESULTS OF THESE TALKS AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS
MADE. [END RECORDING]

   MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, CURRENTLY AN ARENA DEPUTY, SAID THAT THIS
YEAR HE WILL DEDICATE HIS TIME TO EXPAND AND REORGANIZE THE PARTY TO
GET READY FOR THE 1991 MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE WILL
MOST LIKELY NOT BE AN ARENA DEPUTY IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE PERIOD,
BECAUSE HE, ALONG WITH OTHER FORMER LEGISLATORS, WILL CONCENTRATE
THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT.


TST1-MUC3-0020

   SAN SALVADOR, 11 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL. WE HAVE TOURED THE ENTIRE AREA;
SOME HAVE ELECTRICITY, AND OTHERS DO NOT.  THE REBELS HAVE TRIED TO
CREATE A SITUATION.  HOWEVER, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE ARMED
FORCES CONTROL EVERYTHING.

   THIS IS A REPORT FROM THE ENTIRE AREA WHERE THERE HAS BEEN AN
ATTEMPT TO CREATE A SITUATION OF HARASSMENT, AND THAT IS WHAT THE
ARMED FORCES ARE REPORTING TONIGHT. IN A CERTAIN SECTOR, IN THE
VICINITY OF SANTA TECLA OR, [CHANGES THOUGHT] THE ENTIRE SITUATION
THAT IS BEING EXPERIENCED TONIGHT.  [SENTENCE AS HEARD]

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CAN REST ASSURED THAT THE ARMED FORCES
CONTROL EVERYTHING; THERE ARE ONLY SOME BOMBINGS AND SHOOTINGS THAT
WILL NOT LEAD TO ANYTHING. THIS IS ONLY BEING DONE TO MAKE THE PEOPLE
FEEL AS IF THERE WERE SITUATIONS THAT ARE NOT DIFFERENT AT ALL,
BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT LEAD TO ANYTHING, THE SITUATION, RIGHT?
[SENTENCE AS HEARD]

   THAT IS THE REPORT WE CAN GIVE YOU NOW, WHILE WE ARE EXPERIENCING
THE POWER OUTTAGE, AND THE REBLS ARE BRINGING EVERYTHING TO A
STANDSTILL, BUT THIS WILL NOT LEAD TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE THE
PEOPLE FEEL THAT THERE IS AN ALARMING SITUATION.

   I AM REPORTING LIVE FROM THE AREA OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY AND
JARDINES LA SULTANA, WHERE THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY AT PRESENT. WE HAVE
MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO CONTACT YOU BY TELEPHONE AS WE KNOW THIS IS THE
STATION THAT IS HEARD THROUGHOUT EL SALVADOR AND OUTSIDE OUR COUNTRY.

   THAT IS THE SITUATION AT PRESENT. EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.
THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS. IT IS JUST A HARASSMENT BY THE REBELS WHO ARE
TRYING TO SCARE PEOPLE.  EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 AUG 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)]
[TEXT] FMLN COMMUNIQUE TO ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE: CONCERNING THE
TELA AGREEMENTS, THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND HEREBY STATES THE FOLLOWING:

   1. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE A VICTORY FOR THE REVOLUTIONARY,
PROGRESSIVE, INDEPENDENT, AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES OF THE REGION, AND AS
SUCH, WE STRONGLY PRAISE THEM.

   2. THESE AGREEMENTS SEAL THE POLITICAL DEATH OF THE CONTRAS AND
DECLARE TO THE WORLD THE FAILURE OF THE POLICY OF AGGRESSION THAT THE
REAGAN ADMINISTRATION INITIATED AND CARRIED OUT AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF
CENTRAL AMERICA.

   3. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES WERE PREPARED TO PUT
FORWARD A THEORY OF PARALLELS, ALL OF THEIR ALLEGED EVIDENCE WAS
DERIDED AND DISCARDED.

   4. CRISTIANI HAS SIGNED OFF ON THE CONTRAS' DEATH AND ACKNOWLEDGED
BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT THE FMLN IS A FORCE WITH WHICH IT MUST
TALK AND NEGOTIATE.  HE WENT TO TELA WITH A DIALOGUE PLAN TO COVER UP
THE WAR, BUT HE WAS FORCED, UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, TO NEGOTIATE FOR
PEACE WITH THE FMLN.  CRISTIANI'S DIALOGUE COMMISSION, IN FACT, HAS
BEEN DEMOBILIZED.

   5. CRISTIANI WAS FORCED TO SIGN A PLEDGE FOR DEMOCRATIZATION WHEN
HIS PLANS WAS TO FASCISTIZE EL SALVADOR.

   6. THE FMLN REAFFIRMS ITS RESOLVE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE
EFFORTS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES, THE SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOPRIC, AND
OTHER SOCIAL FORCES TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT.  IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CONTRAS WERE A MERCENARY FORCE
MAINTAINED BY THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ATTACKED NICARAGUA FROM
HONDURAS, AND WHICH SHOULD AND COULD BE DEMOBILIZED.  IT IS CLEAR THAT
THE FMLN IS A NATIONAL FORCE THAT HAS REASONS FOR BEING AT WAR, AND
WITH WHICH PEACE MUST BE NEGOTIATED.  NO ONE CAN DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN
BECAUSE IT IS WITHIN THE COUNTRY AND IS A LEGITIMATE NATIONAL FORCE.

   THE FMLN CALLS ON ALL FELLOW PATRIOTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN
HONDURAS, NICARAGUA, COSTA RICA, GUATEMALA, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD
TO RETURN TO THE FATHERLAND.  THEY ARE PROTECTED BY THE TELA
AGREEMENTS.  WE ASK ALL SALVADORANS TO DEMAND OF CRISTIANI THAT,
WITHOUT FURTHER STRATAGEMS, HE CARRY OUT A SERIOUS NEGOTIATION;
FULFILL HIS PLEDGE TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY; STOP THE REPRESSION,
KIDNAPPING, AND TORTURE; RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS; GUARANTEE
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; RESPECT REFORM; AND ABOLISH THE ECONOMIC
MEASURES THAT ARE DEEPENING THE WAR.

   SAN SALVADOR, 15 MAR 89 (AFP) -- [REPORT] [ARTURO GUDINO]
[EXCERPTS] SEVERAL HUNDRED ACTIVISTS OF THE RADICAL BREAD, LAND, WORK,
AND FREEDOM MOVEMENT (MPTTL) MARCHED THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAN
SALVADOR ON TUESDAY, OPENLY DEFYING THE GOVERNMENT AND CONDEMNING "THE
ELECTION FARCE" OF 19 MARCH.

   PEASANTS, WHOSE HARDENED FACES AND BODIES REVEAL THE ENDURANCE OF
LONG WORK DAYS, PARTICIPATED IN THE MARCH ALONG WITH WOMEN, WHO IN
MANY CASES WERE CARRYING THEIR BABIES WHO NEVER KNEW THEIR FATHERS
BECAUSE THEY ARE MISSING OR BECAUSE THEY WERE MURDERED BY SECURITY
FORCES OR DEATH SQUADS, ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY TOLD AFP.

   YOUNG PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES MARCHED ALONG WITH THEM SHOUTING SLOGANS
AND WITH THEIR FACES COVERED WITH RED HANDKERCHIEFS.  THEY CARRIED
IRON RODS AND MOLOTOV COCKTAILS IN THEIR BAGS, "IN CASE THEY WERE
NEEDED TO CONFRONT THE POLICE OR IN CASE THEY HAD TO CHARGE AGAINST A
GOVERNMENT VEHICLE."

   IN THEIR STRING BAGS, THE YOUNG PEOPLE -- SOME OF WHOM CAME DOWN
FROM THE MOUNTAINS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO PROMOTE THE REACTIVATION
OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE MASSES -- ALSO CARRIED SPRAY PAINT CANS, WHICH
THEY WERE READY TO USE TO PAINT SLOGANS ON WALLS AND VEHICLES AT THE
SLIGHTEST OPPORTUNITY.

   "WHAT IS OUR BATTLE CRY?  BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM," THEY
SHOUTED AS THEY MARCHED DOWN THE MAIN AVENUES OF THE CAPITAL CARRYING
HUGE RED FLAGS WITH A BLACK CIRCLE IN THE CENTER, THE MPTTL SYMBOL.

   ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES AND HIGH PARTY LEADERS, THE MPTTL
DEMONSTRATORS ARE "A MINORITY, INSTRUMENTS OF THE TERRORISTS OR SIMPLY
GUERRILLAS THAT CAME DOWN THE MOUNTAINS TO PROMOTE CHAOS."

   LEFTIST LEADERS, HOWEVER, SAID THE MARCH HELD TODAY WAS THE
"EXPRESSION OF THE MAJORITY OF THE 5 MILLION SALVADORANS, A MAJORITY,
WHICH FOR MANY YEARS, SINCE THE 1932 MASSACRE, HAS BEEN SUBJUGATED BY
RIFLES AND HUNGER BUT IS NOW AWAKENING."

[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE MEDIA CAN
MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IF, ON
THEIR OWN INITIATIVE, THEY LAUNCH A GREAT CIVIC CAMPAIGN TO VIGOROUSLY
STIMULATE THE CITIZENS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS.

   FELLOW CITIZENS, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ASKING YOURSELVES WHAT CAN BE
DONE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.  ABOVE ALL, DO NOT PLAY UP TO
TERRORISM.  THE INTERESTS OF THE FATHERLAND ARE ABOVE ALL INDIVIDUAL
OR GROUP INTERESTS, AS IS THE DEFENSE OF OUR DEMOCRACY, WHICH WE HAVE
ALL BEEN BUILDING TOGETHER FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY.  THIS CANNOT BE
THE TIME OF OPPORTUNISM.  THIS IS THE HOUR OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE
COUNTRY, ITS PEOPLE, AND ITS INSTITUTIONS.  THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE
MEASURES AND THE ACTIONS OF THE PUBLIC FORCE DEPEND, FIRST OF ALL, ON
THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CITIZENS.  THE RESULTS WILL BE AS ENCOURAGING
AND AS FAVORABLE AS THE COOPERATION OF THE CITIZENS.  TO REGAIN
TRANQUILITY IS NOT THE EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED FORCES OR
THE STATE.  IT IS A TASK IN WHICH EACH OF US HAS SOMETHING TO
CONTRIBUTE.

   COLOMBIA HAS SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOME EVEN MORE DIFFICULT MOMENTS.  IT
HAS FACED DECISIVELY AND EMERGED VICTORIOUSLY FROM EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN
SITUATIONS.  THAT PAST HAS CREATED SOLID INSTITUTIONS.  FOR THIS
REASON, I AM SURE THAT DEMOCRACY WILL TRIUMPH AND THAT THOSE WHO
COMMIT VIOLENCE, REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY MAY BE, WILL BE PUNISHED.  I
AM SURE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS ALONG THE PATH OF PEACE,
TOLERANCE, AND RESPECT FOR LIFE AND HUMAN DIGNITY.  GOOD NIGHT.

   BOGOTA, 8 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE CAR BOMB ATTACK ON 6 DECEMBER
WHICH DESTROYED THE BUILDING THAT HOUSES THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT
OF SECURITY (DAS, SECRET POLICE) HAD BEEN PLANNED SINCE LAST
SEPTEMBER, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL DISCLOSURES.

   A POLICE SPOKESPERSON CONFIRMED TODAY THAT THE BUS USED IN THE
TERRORIST ACTION WAS BOUGHT BY A MAN WHO IS A NATIVE OF MEDELLIN.  HE
USED FALSE DOCUMENTS TO BUY THE CAR FROM A SCHOOL PROPRIETOR IN
BOGOTA.

   ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE BUYER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE
SINISTER MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS INSTRUCTED BY TERRORISTS ABROAD TO
EXPLODE 500 KG OF DYNAMITE GEL IN FRONT OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE
COUNTRY'S PRINCIPAL SECURITY ORGANIZATION.

   DAS DIRECTOR BRIGADIER GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ SAID ON 7
DECEMBER THAT A MEMBER OF THE SEPARATIST ETA [BASQUE FATHERLAND AND
LIBERTY] GROUP DIRECTED THE OPERATION.

   MAZA MARQUEZ ALSO SAID THAT PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DRUG TRAFFICKERS, "ARE BEHIND
THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK."

   "THE MEDELLIN CARTEL PLANNED THE ATTACK SINCE SEPTEMBER, AFTER
ANOTHER CAR BOMB ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE MAZA MARQUEZ WAS FOILED LAST
MAY," THE POLICE SPOKESPERSON STATED.

   MEANWHILE, THREE PERSONS SUSPECTED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE ATTACK
WERE RELEASED ON 7 DECEMBER, AFTER BEING FOUND INNOCENT.  TWO OTHER
PERSONS ARE BEING HELD BY THE POLICE AND ARE UNDERGOING INTENSE
QUESTIONING.

   THE AUTHORITIES ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS IS 59 AND
NOT 62, AS WAS REPORTED OFFICIALLY ON 7 DECEMBER.

   CIVIL DEFENSE AND RED CROSS CREWS, AS WELL AS ARMED FORCES UNITS,
ARE REMOVING THE RUBBLE FROM A 2-KM-PERIMETER, FEARING THAT PEOPLE MAY
BE PERSONS TRAPPED BENEATH TONS OF IRON AND CEMENT.

REPORTED THAT THE PLAN WAS DISCOVERED FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONS IN
SOUTHWESTERN BOGOTA, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY AT CARVAJAL DISTRICT, WHERE
THE POLICE DISCOVERED A CAR WITH 100 KG OF GELIGNITE AT A RESIDENCE.
THE CAR HAD A SLOW-BURNING FUSE AND MECHANISMS TO SET IT OFF.

   DURING THE SAME INVESTIGATION, THE AUTHORITIES FOUND A TOYOTA
CAMPER WITH 15 KG OF DYNAMITE, A POWERFUL MOTORCYCLE, AND OTHER ITEMS

   BOGOTA, 24 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PRESENCE OF BRITISH AND
ISRAELI MERCENARIES, PAID BY COLOMBIAN EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS AND
DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WAS CONFIRMED TODAY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT
OF SECURITY (DAS), COLOMBIA'S SECRET POLICE.

   THE DAS SENT A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO WHICH WAS PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIBERAL NEWSPAPER EL TIEMPO.
THE REPORT CONFIRMS THAT THERE IS A COLLABERATION BETWEEN DRUG
TRAFFICKERS AND EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS, AND THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN
MERCENARIES IN COLOMBIA -- HIRED BY THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING
DRUG-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS.

   THE OFFICIAL ORGANIZATION ASSERTS THAT THE RECENTLY CREATED EXTREME
RIGHTIST MOVEMENT OF NATIONAL RESTORATION (MORENA) "MUST BE IDENTIFIED
AS THE CULMINATION OF A SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKERS,
SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, GROUPS OF HIRED GUNMEN TRAINED BY FOREIGN
MERCENARIES, AND AGRARIAN BUSINESSMEN WHO ARE TIRED OF THE GUERRILLA
GROUPS' CONSTANT HARASSMENT."

   THE REPORT INDICATES THAT BRITISH AND ISRAELI MERCENARIES
IDENTIFIED AS JOHN OWEN, DAVE TOMKINS, R. PAXTON, P. GLASGOW, A.
DEWER, AND P. ATHERTON ENTERED COLOMBIA THROUGH ELDORADO INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT IN JULY, BUT THE INFORMATION DOES NOT GIVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL
NATIONALITIES.

   THE DAS ADDS THAT DEAN SHELLEY, PETER MCALEESE, ALEX LENOX, AND
ANDRES GIBSON ENTERED THE COUNTRY IN PREVIOUSLY AND SETTLED IN THE
DRUG TRAFFICKERS EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS' MILITARY TRAINING CAMPS IN
PUERTO BOYACA, MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION (CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY),
LA AZULITA (SOUTHERN PUTUMAYO), PUERTO LOPEZ (META DEPARTMENT), AND EL
RECREO (CAQUETA DEPARTMENT) ON THE NORTHEASTERN FLATLANDS.

   RADIO STATIONS' REPORTS ADDED THAT COLONEL YAIR KLEIN HAS BEEN
IDENTIFIED AMONG THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES BY THE SECRET SERVICES OF HIS
COUNTRY.  KLEIN WAS COMMANDER OF A PARATROOPERS' UNIT IN 1983 AND
APPARENTLY HAS A PRIVATE SECURITY AGENCY IN ISRAEL.

   ABRAHAM TZADAKA AND JACOBO BRINE WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED BY THEIR
FELLOW COUNTRYMEN.

   ON A NATIONAL NEWSCAST BROADCAST SEVERAL WEEKS AGO A VIDEO WHICH
SHOWS THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES WEARING BLUE UNIFORMS DURING WAR
MANEUVERS WITH THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS FAR RIGHT-WING GROUPS' PRIVATE
ARMY.  THE SCENES WERE REPRODUCED BY THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IN THE
UNITED STATES.

   PREVIOUS REPORTS FROM THE DAS, REVEALED IN COLOMBIA, INDICATE THAT
THE COLOMBIANS TRAINED BY THE MERCENARIES INCLUDE PERSONS LINKED WITH
THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION AND THE
RECENTLY CREATED MORENA.

   THE FIRST PERSONS TO NOTIFY THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL OF THE NATION,
THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY, ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES AMONG
THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS FAR RIGHT-WING ARMED GROUPS WERE DESERTERS FROM
THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS -- IDENTIFIED AS JESUS
ALBERTO MOLINA URREA, RICAURTE DUQUE ARBOLEDA, AND VICTOR ARBOLEDA
DUQUE.

   ACCORDING TO THE DESERTERS' DECLARATIONS, THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES
CANNOT SPEAK SPANISH AND THEY FREQUENTLY MET WITH GONZALO DE JESUS
PEREZ, HENRY PEREZ, AND MARCELO PEREZ.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS REPORT REVEALED TODAY, "THE PEREZES," ARE
IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF MIDDLE MAGDALENA CATTLEMEN
(ACDEGAM), THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, AND MORENA; AND THE AUTHORITIES
CHARGE THEM WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF PEASANTS IN URABA, LOCATED IN THE
COUNTRY'S NORTHWESTERN AREA.

   LA PAZ, 18 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] IT HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY REPORTED
IN LA PAZ THAT A BOMB ATTACK OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING SOMEWHERE
NEAR THE PLACE WHERE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA AND PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT GARCIA ARE TO MEET TODAY.

   NAVY LIEUTENANT JUSTO MARTINEZ, COMMANDER OF THE PORT OF THE
BOLIVIAN CITY OF COPACABANA, REPORTED THAT A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE
PERUVIAN TOWN OF YUNGUYO, WHICH IS LOCATED NEAR THE BORDER BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES, APPROXIMATELY 10 KM FROM COPACABANA.

   MARTINEZ ADDED THAT THE OFFICES OF THE DEPUTY MAYOR, A CIVILIAN
OFFICE OCCUPIED BY THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR, WAS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE
TERRORIST ATTACK.

   THE NAVY OFFICER TOLD LA PAZ RADIO PANAMERICANA THAT RECONNAISANCE
PATROLS HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE BORDER WITH PERU AND OTHER "CRITICAL"
POINTS OF COPACABANA BAY IN ORDER TO GUARD THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING.

   IT IS IN FRONT OF THIS LAKE TITICACA BAY THAT PAZ ZAMORA AND GARCIA
WILL MEET TODAY TO DISCUSS BILATERAL TOPICS AND MATTERS PERTAINING TO
DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   BOLIVIA AND PERU GROW 90 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S COCA LEAVES, WHICH
ARE USED TO PRODUCE COCAINE.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 10 MAY 90 (CIRCUITO RPC TELEVISION) -- [TEXT]
ENDING OUR NEWSCAST, WE REPORT THAT AN ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE
SPOKESMAN STATED TO A RPC TELEVISION REPORTER LATE THIS AFTERNOON THAT
THERE ARE NO GROUNDS TO MANTAIN THE ARREST ORDERS AGAINST FORMER MAYOR
GONZALO, AKA CHALO, GONZALEZ, WHO HAD TAKEN ASYLUM IN THE PERUVIAN
EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY.  THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT THE ARREST ORDER
AGAINST THE FORMER OFFICER HAD BEEN REVOKED BECAUSE ONE OF THE PERSONS
IMPLICATED IN THE [JUSTINES RODRIGUEZ CHILD MURDER] CASE HAD WITHDRAWN
HIS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST FORMER MAYOR GONZALO GONZALEZ.  ACCORDING TO
THIS REPORT, THE WITNESS SAID HE HAD ACCUSED GONZALEZ FOR PERSONAL
REASONS.  THEREFORE, GONZALEZ IS NO LONGER ACCUSED IN THE JUSTINES
RODRIGUEZ CRIME.

   BEIJING (PRC), 30 NOV 89 (XINHUA DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] ON 30
NOVEMBER WHEN U.S.  PRESIDENT BUSH SET FORTH TO MALTA TO MEET WITH
SOVIET LEADER GORBACHEV, A REPORT FROM ANGOLA SAID THAT A CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY [CIA] AIRPLANE ON A CLANDESTINE MISSION OF
DELIVERING WEAPONS TO THE ANTIGOVERNMENT NATIONAL UNION FOR THE TOTAL
INDEPENDENCE OF ANGOLA (UNITA) CRASHED IN SOUTHERN ANGOLA ON 27
NOVEMBER AND THAT THE FOUR AMERICANS ON THE PLANE WERE KILLED.  TODAY
BOTH THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMED
THE CRASH, BUT THEY REFUSED TO COMMENT ON WHETHER THE AMERICANS WHO
WERE KILLED WERE CIA OFFICIALS, OR ON THE NATURE OF THE PLANE'S
MISSION.  THIS IS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE RESPONSE THAT THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT MADE A FEW DAYS AGO IN CONNECTION WITH A PLANE CRASH IN EL
SALVADOR.

   AFTER A PLANE CARRYING WEAPONS TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS CRASHED
ON 25 NOVEMBER, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE BAKER PROMPTLY INSTRUCTED THE
UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE ON THAT SAME EVENING TO SUMMON THE SOVIET
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES TO PROTEST TO THE SOVIET UNION FOR
UNDERMINING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND "FAILING TO EXERCISE ITS
INFLUENCE" TO STOP CUBA AND NICARAGUA FROM DELIVERING WEAPONS TO THE
GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR.  IN THIS CONNECTION, A U.S.  GOVERNMENT
OFFICIAL POINTED OUT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH WOULD PRESENT THE CENTRAL
AMERICA ISSUE AS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WHILE DISCUSSING PROBLEMS OF
REGIONAL CONFLICTS WITH SOVIET LEADERS DURING THEIR MEDITERRANEAN
MEETING.  SOME OFFICIALS EVEN SAID THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICA ISSUE IS
THE "PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE" TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS,
AND THAT ONLY WHEN THE USSR MAKES FURTHER CONCESSIONS ON THE CENTRAL
AMERICA ISSUE WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES TO PROVIDE
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE SOVIET UNION.

   IN A CEASEFIRE ACCORD SIGNED ON 24 JUNE THIS YEAR, UNITA AND THE
ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO SEEK WAYS AND MEANS TO CONCLUDE THE CIVIL
WAR THAT HAD GONE ON FOR 14 YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT
KEEPS SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UNITA.  ACCORDING TO U.S.  NEWSPAPERS, EVER
SINCE THE SOUTH AFRICAN AUTHORITIES STOPPED SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UNITA
LAST APRIL, THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME UNITA'S MAIN WEAPON SUPPLIER.
THE SECRET THAT THE UNITED STATES' MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO UNITA
INCREASED FROM $15 MILLION TO $50 MILLION THIS YEAR WAS REVEALED AFTER
THE CRASH OF THE CIA'S WEAPON CARRIER.  NOW, EVEN THE U.S. PRESS HAS
ASKED THIS QUESTION: COULD IT PREVENT PRESIDENT BUSH FROM PRESENTING
HIS CRITICISM WHEN PROBLEMS OF REGIONAL CONFLICTS ARE DISCUSSED WHEN
HE MEETS THE SOVIET LEADER?  A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAID:
"NOT AT ALL," "WE WILL NOT PLACE (THE TWO) ON A PAR."  A STATE
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ALSO SAID THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE
TO PROVIDE "APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE" TO UNITA IN THE
FUTURE.


TST1-MUC3-0030

   NO CITY (PERU), 16 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [GARCIA] AS A LATIN
AMERICAN PRESIDENT, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE OVER THE
STATEMENT THAT THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE VICTIMS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED
IN LATIN AMERICA AND THAT COLOMBIA, PERU, AND BOLIVIA ARE TO BLAME FOR
PRODUCING THE DRUGS; LET'S CALL THOSE COUNTRIES TO TALK WITH THEM.
THAT SEEMS TO ME A VERY ETHNOCENTRIC VISION; IT LOOKS AT THIS MATTER
FROM ONLY ONE SIDE.  OUR PEASANTS ARE POOR PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE WHATEVER
IS MOST PROFITABLE, AND COCA CULTIVATION HAPPENS TO BE MOST PROFITABLE
FOR THEM.  THIS IS SO, SPEAKING COLDLY, HONESTLY, AND SINCERELY.  AS
PRESIDENT OF PERU I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT MY PEOPLE, THE HUALLAGE
REGION PEASANTS, CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CRIMINALS OR AS PEOPLE WHO
MUST BE JAILED FOR PRODUCING COCA LEAVES.

   WE HAVE EXCHANGED THESE VIEWS WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND WE REACHED
THESE CONCLUSIONS.  WE MUST ALSO NOTE THAT THIS MATTER HAS BEEN
HANDLED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLICITY. AFTER THE DEATH OF CARLOS
GALAN, A GREAT COLOMBIAN LEADER, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED AN
OFFENSIVE INTENDED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ASSASSINATION, AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THEN
EXTENDED SOME ASSISTANCE.  THIS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PRESENT TO THE
WORLD AS THOUGH THE UNITED STATES HAD SENT AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF
AIRCRAFT, HUNDREDS OF HELICOPTERS, AND THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS TO COLOMBIA.  AS I WAS ABLE TO SEE IN BOGOTA, ONLY
HELICOPTERS, SOME OF WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED EARLIER BY THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT, WERE SENT.  I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT SOME OF THOSE
HELICOPTERS HAD BEEN USED PREVIOUSLY IN PERU.

   I HAVE SAID THAT, IF THERE IS THAT MUCH CONVICTION, I SUPPORT
PRESIDENT BUSH FOR DEFENDING U.S. SOCIETY.  IF HE HAS THAT MUCH
CONVICTION, IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OF
WHAT IS SPENT IN ARMS AND MILITARY EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO
REPLACE COCA PLANTATIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE GENERAL SITUATION IN LATIN
AMERICA.  WE HAVE TALKED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK WITH
PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA TO SEE HOW WE CAN EXCHANGE OPINIONS.  THEN, AS
PRESIDENT BUSH SAID, A MEETING OF PRESIDENTS WILL BE WELCOME.  BUT THE
MEETING SHOULD ALSO BE ATTENDED BY EUROPE, WHICH HAS A FUNDAMENTAL
INTEREST IN THE FUTURE.

   [CORRESPONDENT] WOULD THE IDEA BE TO HOLD A MEETING IN THE NEAR
FUTURE OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND A
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EEC?

   [GARCIA] YES, BECAUSE DRUG TRAFFICKING IS A GROWING PROBLEM.
CARTELS HAVE SPROUTED IN COLOMBIA -- MONOPOLIES THAT TRY TO ELECT
DEPUTIES AND SENATORS TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT.  THOSE MONOPOLIES
MIGHT EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO OUR COUNTRIES IF WE DO NOT STOP THIS
GROWING PROBLEM. THE SITUATION CAN BECOME WORSE IN BOLIVIA, WHERE IT
WAS SAID THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD AN INFLUENCE ON A DICTATORIAL
MILITARY REGIME.  IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF PROTECTING THE MORALITY
OF HUMANITY; IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE UNITED STATES,
WHICH HAS A PRIMARY ROLE IN WORLD LEADERSHIP; IT IS ESSENTIALLY A
MATTER OF DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRACY -- THE LEGITIMACY AND CLEANLINESS OF
OUR SOCIAL LIFE.  I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A MEETING OF THE THREE
PRESIDENTS FIRST, SO THAT WE CAN LET THE U.S.  PRESIDENT KNOW OUR
VIEWS ON THE OVERALL PROBLEM.

   [CORRESPONDENT] WILL YOU PROPOSE THAT MEETING, MR PRESIDENT?

   [GARCIA] I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME A LEADING ROLE.  THE IDEA EMERGED
IN A CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK LATER WITH
PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA.

   [CORRESPONDENT] A MEETING BETWEEN YOU AND PRESIDENT BUSH LATE THIS
MONTH HAS BEEN MENTIONED.  IS THIS TRUE, MR PRESIDENT?

   [GARCIA] NO, I BELIEVE THAT HAS BEEN MERE SPECULATION IN THE PRESS.
FOR THE TIME BEING I HAVE DISCARDED THE IDEA OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP
ABROAD.  I DO NOT SEE THE CONCRETE POSSIBILITY OF MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT BUSH, ALTHOUGH I HOPE WE CAN MEET SOMETIME BEFORE 28 JULY
1990.

   [CORRESPONDENT] CHANGING THE SUBJECT, MR PRESIDENT -- MUCH HAS BEEN
SAID IN RECENT DAYS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE EXPULSION OF PERU
FROM THE IMF.  WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS, AND WHAT WOULD EXPULSION
MEAN?

   [GARCIA] WELL, FIRST, IT IS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PERU TO BE
EXPELLED FROM THE IMF.  SECOND, THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND ALARMISM
REGARDING THE MATTER.  WHAT IS THE IMF?  IT IS SOME SORT OF CREDITOR
BANK CREATED IN 1946 THAT LENDS MONEY TO COUNTRIES WITH
BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS; THAT IS, WITH PROBLEMS WITH THEIR
FOREIGN RESERVES LEVELS.  WHEN A COUNTRY HAS NO RESERVES OR ONLY $100
MILLION IN RESERVES, IT CAN APPLY FOR A CREDIT FROM THE IMF TO PAY FOR
IMPORTS OR OVERDUE DEBTS.  THIS IS THE IMF, AN ORGANIZATION CREATED TO
FACILITATE THE FLOW OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  AN IMF
CREDIT IS DEPENDENT ON SIGNING A LETTER OF INTENT OR AN ADJUSTMENT
PROGRAM.  ADJUSTMENT MEANS REDUCING THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL CONSUMPTION
SO AS TO SPARE THE COUNTRY'S RESERVES IN ORDER TO MEET DEBT
OBLIGATIONS.  [CONTINUED]

THAT THE DAUGHTER OF ISRAEL'S AMBASSADOR TO EL SALVADOR WAS SERIOUSLY
WOUNDED BY GUNFIRE SHOTS IS ABSOLUTELY UNFOUNDED.  THE AMBASSADOR'S
DAUGHTER, WITH HER FAMILY, IS IN ISRAEL.  SHE IS SAFE AND SOUND.  THE

REPEAT, THE REPORT HAS NO BASIS WHATSOEVER.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] ON THE

   BUENOS AIRES, 18 MAY 90 (NA) -- [TEXT] NEXT JUNE AN ENTIRE U.S.
ARMY COMPANY WILL CARRY OUT JOINT MANEUVERS WITH ARGENTINE TROOPS IN A
PROVINCE OF THE LITTORAL REGION.  THE MANEUVERS, DESIGNED TO TEACH THE
ARGENTINE OFFICERS THE LATEST TECHNIQUES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING,
FALL WITHIN THE COMPREHENSIVE MILITARY EXCHANGE PLAN.  GENERAL MAXWELL
THURMAN'S VISIT IS ALSO PART OF THE AFOREMENTIONED PLAN.

   ACCORDING TO RELIABLE SOURCES, THE RECENT VISIT FROM THE UNITED
STATES OF 10 LIEUTENANT COLONELS, THREE COLONELS, AND EIGHT CIVILIAN
EXPERTS IN DEFENSE STRATEGY, REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE
RENEWED U.S.-ARGENTINE MILITARY RELATIONSHIP.

   THE SAME SOURCES HAVE STATED THAT THE GRADUAL AND RESTRICTED
PARTICIPATION OF THE ARMY IN MANEUVERS DESIGNED TO PRACTICE FIGHTING
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTRY
AND EVEN BY THE PRESIDENT.

   THE MILITARY GROUP THAT ARRIVED IN ARGENTINA ON 6 MAY CARRIED OUT
WAR GAMES AT THE WAR SCHOOL AND THE CAMPO DE MAYO MILITARY SCHOOL AND,
LATER ON, CARRIED OUT FIELD MANEUVERS. OTHER FORCES PARTICIPATED IN
THE THREE-DAY MANEUVERS THAT WERE CARRIED OUT ON AN ISLAND IN THE
RIVER PLATE DELTA. ACCORDING TO A WITNESS, THE MANEUVERS CONSISTED OF
"RAIDS" INCLUDING "SURPRISE" SITUATIONS THAT FORCED THE U.S. TROOPS TO
ENDURE BAD WEATHER AND BAD TERRAIN.

   ACCORDING TO THE FINAL EVALUATION, THE MANEUVERS WERE REGARDED AS
"SATISFACTORY AND SUCCESSFUL".  ACCORDING TO THE PROGRAM, A COMPLETE
U.S. COMPANY THAT WILL TRAIN WITH ARGENTINE TROOPS IN A PROVINCE OF
THE LITTORAL REGION IS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE IN JUNE.

   FOREIGN MINISTRY SOURCES CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF EXCHANGE PLANS
BUT STATED THAT GENERAL THURMAN HAD PROPOSED TO THE CHIEFS OF STAFF
THE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT JOINT MANEUVERS TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING DURING A LUNCHEON.

   THE SOURCES STATED THAT THE CHIEFS OF STAFF HAVE MADE SOME
OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSAL AND DID NOT REACH ANY AGREEMENT. HOWEVER,
SOURCES THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE RECENT MANEUVERS ON THE ISLAND HAD A
DIFFERENT OPINION AND RATIFIED THAT ANOTHER MANEUVER WOULD BE HELD IN
A PROVINCE OF THE LITTORAL IN JUNE.

   ANYHOW, THE STATEMENT OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN FALLS
WITHIN THE DIPLOMATIC POLICY THAT MAY PARTLY DIFFER WITH THE MILITARY
AND DEFENSE POLICIES, AS WAS POINTED OUT BY A SECTOR OF THE MEDIA
YESTERDAY.

   MOREOVER, GENERAL THURMAN WILL REMAIN IN SAN CARLOS DE BARILOCHE
UNTIL SATURDAY, 19 MAY, AND THAT SAME DAY WILL FLY TO THE IGUAZU FALLS
FROM WHERE HE WILL RETURN TO HIS MILITARY BASE IN PANAMA.

   THE ONLY PURPOSE OF GENERAL THURMAN'S VISIT WAS TO OFFER THE
DEFENSE MINISTRY ALL THE TECHNOLOGY, KNOW HOW, AND WEAPONS FOR THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING WHICH, IN MANY CASES TURNS INTO
NARCOTERRORISM, IN OTHER WORDS, THE USE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING TO FINANCE
THE PURCHASE OF WEAPONS AND TERRORIST ACTIONS. THURMAN'S VISIT, WHICH
TOOK THE UNITED STATES A WHOLE YEAR TO ARRANGE, WAS PREVIOUSLY
APPROVED BY THE U.S. SENATE.

   WITHIN THE SAME FRAMEWORK, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE HAVE JUST RECEIVED
WEAPONS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT AMOUNTING TO $50 MILLION, WHICH IS ENOUGH
TO EQUIP TWO COMPLETE BATTALIONS IN CHARGE OF FIGHTING DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.

   THEREFORE, THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING LAUNCHED BY THE UNITED STATES IS
PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY OF THE SOUTHERN CONE OF WHICH
ARGENTINA -- ACCORDING TO EXPERTS -- MUST PARTICIPATE OUT OF FEAR OF A
GROWING ISOLATION.

   IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT THE RESTRICTED AND GRADUAL -- BY NO MEANS
MASSIVE -- PARTICIPATION OF THE ARMY AND PROBABLY THE NAVY IN
MANEUVERS FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING MAY BE THE KEY
THAT WILL FINALLY ALLOW THE ARMED FORCES TO ACQUIRE THE WAR MATERIEL,
SPARE PARTS AND OTHER ELEMENTS IT NEEDS.

   THE ANALYSTS HAVE RECALLED THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION
TO FIGHT CORRUPTION -- A PROBLEM THAT ALSO WORRIES PRESIDENT CARLOS
MENEM AND VICE PRESIDENT EDUARDO DUHALDE -- FALLS WITHIN THE SAME
FRAMEWORK BECAUSE, IN THE EXPERTS' OPINION, IT IS THE EQUIVALENT TO
DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   HIGHLY RELIABLE SOURCES HAVE RECALLED THAT 30 DAYS AGO PRESIDENT
GEORGE BUSH SENT PRESIDENT MENEM TWO VOLUMES OF A U.S. EDITION ON
TECHNIQUES TO FIGHT CORRUPTION.

PEACE PROCESS WITH M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] THAT WAS INTERRUPTED DUE
TO THE MURDER OF TWO MEMBERS OF THAT SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION -- NOW
OBSERVING A TRUCE -- WAS RESTORED FOLLOWING A VISIT BY PRESIDENTIAL
ADVISER RAFAEL PARDO TO THE M-19 CAMP IN SANTO DOMINGO, CAUCA
DEPARTMENT.  OUR CORRESPONDENT MARIA ALEJANDRA GONZALEZ WAS THERE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GONZALEZ] THE PEACE PROCESS BETWEEN M-19 AND THE
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZED THIS WEEK DUE TO THE
MURDER OF TWO MEMBERS OF THAT GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION, WHICH OCCURRED
AT THE BORDER BETWEEN CAUCA AND VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENTS.  CARLOS
PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE SITUATION.

   [PIZARRO] WE ARE LIVING A SLOW MOTION PEACE PROCESS.  WE NEED A
PEACE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH COLOMBIANS CAN FEEL THAT PEACE HAS
ARRIVED, INSTEAD OF A PROCESS THAT IS SIMPLY A PERMANENT AND ENDLESS
ACCOUNT OF PEACE TRAGEDIES.

   [GONZALEZ] OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS, PRESIDENTIAL PEACE ADVISER
RAFAEL PARDO AND DEPUTY GOVERNMENT MINISTER JOSE NOE RIOS MET WITH
MEMBERS OF THE M-19 COMMAND.  THE PARTICIPANTS REAFFIRMED THEIR
DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE WITH THE PEACE EFFORTS.

   A FORUM FOR LIFE, DEMOCRACY, AND PROGRESS WILL BE HELD IN SANTO
DOMINGO THIS WEEKEND, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL LEADERS AND
REPRESENTATIVES FROM GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS.  THE EVENT WILL INCLUDE
SPORTS AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES.  COMMISSIONS WILL WORK ON DEVELOPMENT
PLANS.  AT LEAST 2,000 PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND AT THE PEACE
CAMP.

   SAN SALVADOR, 23 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REJECTED A REBEL PROPOSAL TO IMMEDIATELY
NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE WITH THE ARMY UNDER OAS AND UNITED NATIONS
SUPERVISION; HOWEVER, HE DID EXPRESS HIS INTENTION TO SEEK A POLITICAL
SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.

   THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE ATTACKED THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR
WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE AND ROCKETS JUST AS PRESIDENT CRISTIANI REJECTED
THE DIALOGUE PROPOSAL MADE BY THE GUERRILLAS ON 22 NOVEMBER.

   FOUR "PUSH AND PULL" PLANES AND TWO HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS OPENED FIRE
ON ALLEGED FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] COLUMNS IN
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.

   "THEIR PROPOSAL IS NOT SERIOUS, (THE REBELS) ARE ONCE AGAIN SAYING
THAT THERE ARE TWO ARMED FORCES.  IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS ONLY ONE
ARMED FORCE," CRISTIANI SAID.  HE ADDED THAT A POLITICAL SOLUTION
ENTAILS THAT THE GUERRILLAS END THE VIOLENCE.

   THE PRESIDENT, ACCOMPANIED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF
STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES, SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THE FMLN
PROPOSAL "IS NOT VERY SERIOUS" BECAUSE "IT IS NOT AIMED AT THE
GOVERNMENT BUT AT THE ARMY, WHICH IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT," HE SAID.

   ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE NEW FMLN PROPOSAL IS "PROPAGANDIST" AND
IS ONLY MEANT TO GAIN SOME TIME IN VIEW OF THE "MILITARY DEFEAT
SUFFERED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS."

   CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO SEEK A RATIONAL
SOLUTION TO THE MILITARY CONFLICT IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT HE
CATEGORICALLY EMPHASIZED THAT THIS MEANS THAT THE GUERRILLAS MUST LAY
DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   "WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE GUERRILLAS TO REGROUP AND BEGIN ATTACKING
AGAIN.  IF THEY WANT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THEY SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR
WEAPONS AND PEACEFULLY JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS," CRISTIANI SAID.

   THE PRESIDENT WARNED THAT "THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE
WILLING TO FIGHT MILITARILY. IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE FMLN
CONTINUES TO BEHAVE THIS WAY, NOT LISTENING TO REASON, AND NOT ENDING
THIS MADNESS," THE RIGHTIST PRESIDENT SAID.

   THE NEWS CONFERENCE, HELD WITH SOME 50 JOURNALISTS, WAS ABRUPTLY
INTERRUPTED BY THE HEAVY BOMBINGS CARRIED OUT BY THE SALVADORAN AIR
FORCE AGAINST ALLEGED GUERRILLA COLUMNS.

   FOLLOWING THE FIRST BOMBINGS, WHICH ROCKED THE MILITARY OFFICES
WHERE THE NEWS CONFERENCE WAS BEING HELD, CRISTIANI AND PONCE RESUMED
CONTROL OF THE CONFERENCE AND EXPLAINED THAT THE ATTACK WAS THE RESULT
OF AN OPERATION IN PURSUIT OF THE "GUERRILLAS FLEEING IN DISARRAY."

   THE AIR FORCE BOMBING BEGAN SHORTLY BEFORE THE CURFEW, WHICH BEGAN
AT 1800 (0000 GMT) UNTIL 0600 IN THE MORNING (1200 GMT), JUST WHEN
THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WERE RETURNING HOME.

   THE HEAVY EXPLOSIONS CAUSED ALARM AMONG THE POPULATION IN NORTHERN
SAN SALVADOR AND IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN HURT.

   ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE "HAS BEEN A
FAILURE" NOT ONLY MILITARILY, BUT POLITICALLY AS WELL BECAUSE THEY
WERE UNABLE TO INCITE THE PEOPLE TO REBELLION, AS THEY PLANNED.

   THE PROPOSAL SIGNED BY THE TOP FIVE FMLN COMMANDERS AND READ ON THE
OFFICIAL REBEL STATION, CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS, HAS BEEN
RELEASED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A REBEL MILITARY OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN
12 DAYS AGO AND WHICH HAS LEFT MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE DEAD, HUNDREDS
OF PEOPLE WOUNDED, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] TWO U.S. CITIZENS HAVE BEEN
KILLED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS, VICTIMS OF THE SALVADORAN WAR THAT THEIR
OWN COUNTRY SUPPORTS AND FINANCES, LABOR AND POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE
TOLD DPA.

   THE U.S. EMBASSY HAS NOT OFFICIALLY REPORTED THIS TRAGEDY, BUT IT WAS
LEARNED FROM JUDICIAL SOURCES THAT ERIKA SULLIVAN AND CHRISTOPHER
ANDERSON, A 26-YEAR-OLD TEACHER AT THE AMERICAN SCHOOL HAVE BEEN KILLED.  

   ACCORDING TO THE RED CROSS, MISS SULLIVAN WAS DRIVING HER VEHICLE WHEN
SHE WAS CAUGHT IN THE HEAVY SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE ON 11 NOVEMBER.
ANDERSON LIVED NEAR PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S MANSION, AND WHEN HE
HEARD THE EXPLOSIONS DURING THE ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENT'S HOME, HE WENT
OUTSIDE TO PUT HIS CAR IN THE GARAGE.  UNFORTUNATELY, AT THAT MOMENT, A
GRENADE HIT HIS CAR.

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT THEIR BODIES WILL BE SENT TO THE UNITED STATES
TODAY.  THE DAUGHTER OF THE EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR, NADINE ELKASHES, WAS
ALMOST KILLED ALSO.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 26 AUG 89 (BARRICADA) -- [ARTICLE] [MARTHA
MARINA GONZALEZ] [TEXT] TEOTECACINTE -- MORE THAN 400
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES HAVE DESERTED THE CAMPS IN YAMALES AND ARE
ROAMING THE AREAS OF TROJES, CIFUENTES, JAMASTRAN, EL PARAISO, DANLI,
SAN MARCOS, AND TEGUCIGALPA, DESPERATELY TRYING TO SLIP INTO THE
REFUGEE GROUPS TO BE REPATRIATED -- HAD TIES WITH THE CONTRAS FOR 7
YEARS AND WAS FINALLY REPATRIATED ON WEDNESDAY 23 AUGUST.

   AN INTERIOR MINISTRY SOURCE CONFIRMED TO BARRICADA THAT A CONTRA
DESERTER PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS A REFUGEE ENTERED THE COUNTRY WITH A
GROUP OF PEOPLE REPATRIATED BY THE ACNUR.

   THE TELA AGREEMENTS HAVE CAUSED HAVOC NOT ONLY IN THE CONTRA RANKS,
BUT ALSO IN THE REFUGEE CAMPS.  THEIR DESPERATION TO RETURN TO
NICARAGUA IS SUCH THAT MORE THAN 160 PERSONS TRIED TO ENTER THE
COUNTRY ON 24 AUGUST THROUGH THE MURUPUCHI AND CERRO LA PIEDRA BORDER
POSTS, BUT THE HONDURAN ARMY STOPPED THEM BECAUSE THEY LACKED THE
NECESSARY DOCUMENTS.

   ACCORDING TO JOSE TOMAS OSORIO, THE REFUGEES TRUST THE GUARANTEES
OFFERED BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT.  THIS WAS ASCERTAINED BY SEVERAL
JOURNALISTS AT THE CERRO LA PIEDRA BORDER POST.  SEVERAL PERSONS
QUICKLY GOT OUT OF A VEHICLE BUT THE HONDURAN TROOPS' PRESENCE
FRUSTRATED THEIR PLAN.

   THE RED CROSS' BRANCH IN JALAPA HAS INSTALLED A RECEPTION POST IN
CERRO LA PIEDRA, BEHIND THE TROJES CEMETERY, TO AVOID TRAGEDIES LIKE
THE ONE WHICH OCCURRED LAST WEEK, WHEN A YOUTH FELL INTO A MINED
FIELD.  THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOW BE ABLE TO CROSS THE BORDER, IF THE
HONDURAN ARMY ALLOWS THEM, WITHOUT FACING ANY DANGER.

   RED CROSS PRESIDENT DENIS GUZMAN, WHO IS ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE
PEACE COMMISSION, SPOKE ON 25 AUGUST WITH THE PERSON COMMANDING THE
HONDURAN BORDER POST.  HE SAID THAT THE RED CROSS WAS WILLING TO
ACCEPT ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO RETURN TO NICARAGUA.  THE HONDURAN
OFFICER SAID: "WE HAVE NO INFORMATION BUT, IF MY COMMANDER AUTHORIZES
IT, WE WILL NOT OBJECT AND WILL LET THEM PASS.  HOWEVER, WE CANNOT LET
ANYONE CROSS THROUGH HERE FOR THE TIME BEING."

   SEVERAL REPATRIATED PERSONS RETURNING ON 23 AUGUST THROUGH LAS
MANOS CONFIRMED THE PROBLEMS OF THE REFUGEES AT THE CAMPS: "THERE IS
NO FREEDOM TO WORK, THE FOOD IS RATIONED, THE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
HUNGRY, AND WE LIVED LIKE ANIMALS IN A CORRAL," IT WAS STATED BY
ERNESTINA UMANZOR, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED AT THE CIFUENTES BORDER REGION
AND LATER WAS REPATRIATED.

   REFERRING TO THE CONTRAS, THE NICARAGUANS LIVING IN HONDURAN
TERRITORY SAID THAT THE FORMER "ARE OUTSIDE THE LAW; THEY HAVE NOTHING
TO DO; THEY MUST PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS; THEY MUST BE DEMOBILIZED;
THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS GOING TO THIRD COUNTRIES; THEY MUST RETURN TO
THEIR HOMELAND," IT WAS ASSERTED BY DOMINGO OROZCO.

   THE REPATRIATED PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED AT TEOTECACINTE WERE WELCOMED BY
LOCAL PEOPLE, WHO WERE SATISFIED WITH THEIR RETURN AND SAID THEY WOULD
SUPPORT THOSE WHO WISH TO TILL IDLE AND ABANDONED LANDS.

SEVERAL STUDENTS, AND BROKE UP THE DEMONSTRATION.

   BOGOTA, 4 JAN 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY "THE EXTRADITABLES," AN
ORGANIZATION CONSIDERED TO BE THE ARMED SECTOR OF THE "MEDELLIN
CARTEL," ORDERED "ITS LEADERS" IN LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS "TO TAKE
HOSTAGES FROM TRADITIONAL BOURGEOISIE SECTORS TO FINANCE THE WAR" IT
IS WAGING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO.

   "THE EXTRADITABLES" SENT A 7-POINT COMMUNIQUE TO SEVERAL MEDIA
SOURCES IN MEDELLIN, CALLING ON THEIR MEN TO DEMAND LARGE SUMS OF
MONEY FROM THE RELATIVES OF THE PERSONS THEY KIDNAP.

   THEY ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE PERSONS WHO ARE GOING TO CARRY OUT THE
ABDUCTIONS SHOULD SELECT THE VICTIMS FROM AMONG POLITICIANS AND
MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIAN BOURGEOISIE "WHO HAVE NEVER DISTINGUISHED
THEMSELVES BY MAKING SOCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY."

   THEY ADD THAT "50 PERCENT OF THE FUNDS OBTAINED FROM SUCH MILITARY
ACTIONS ARE TO BE USED TO FINANCE THE WAR AGAINST THE POLITICAL
OLIGARCHY AND THE OTHER 50 PERCENT TO RECONSTRUCT LOW-INCOME HOUSING
FOR THE HOMELESS."

   ANOTHER POINT NOTES THAT "THIS MEASURE HAS BEEN TAKEN AS A RESPONSE
TO THE OFFICIAL PERSECUTION AGAINST OUR FAMILIES AND ORGANIZATIONS,"
AND IT CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT "WE ARE WILLING TO HOLD A DIALOGUE AS
THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE REQUESTING AND DESIRE."

   ON 24 AUGUST 1989, "THE EXTRADITABLES" ANNOUNCED A COUNTEROFFENSIVE
IN RESPONSE TO THE OFFICIAL ACTIONS OF PRESIDENT BARCO'S GOVERNMENT.
THE GOVERNMENT INITIATED THE ATTACK ON THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS
AFTER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS KILLED ON 18
AUGUST.

   SINCE THEN, DRUG TRAFFICKERS BEGAN A SERIES OF ATTACKS WITH
EXPLOSIVES AND CAR BOMBS MAINLY AGAINST BANKING ORGANIZATIONS,
POLITICAL HEADQUARTERS, AND NEWSPAPERS.

   ON 2 SEPTEMBER, A CAR BOMB DESTROYED THE INSTALLATIONS OF "EL
ESPECTADOR" NEWSPAPER IN BOGOTA AND 5 WEEKS LATER ANOTHER CAR BOMB
CAUSED SIMILAR DAMAGE TO THE "VANGUARDIA LIBERAL" NEWSPAPER IN
BUCARAMANGA, IN NORTHEASTERN COLOMBIA.

   SEVERAL SECURITY FORCES HEADQUARTERS HAVE ALSO BEEN HIT BY THESE
ATTACKS AND AN AVIANCA AIRLINES PLANE BLEW UP IN MIDAIR ON 27 NOVEMBER
KILLING ALL 107 PASSENGERS AND CREW.

   A WEEK LATER, A BUS BOMB BLEW UP IN THE VICINITY OF THE
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS), IN THE CENTER OF BOGOTA,
AND DESTROYED THE 11-FLOOR BUILDING, LEAVING 67 DEAD AND APPROXIMATELY
1,000 WOUNDED.

   CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION, WE
HAVE A LAST MINUTE REPORT.  RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTS TO OUR PEOPLE ON
THE FIGHTING THAT IS UNDER WAY IN SAN SALVADOR.  WE ARE GOING TO GIVE
YOU MILITARY INFORMATION FROM THE METROPOLITAN WAR FRONT, AS FOLLOWS:

   THERE HAS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST ATLACATL BATTALION ARMORED VEHICLES
IN CUSCATANCINGO.  AT 0700, THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE AMBUSH IN WHICH SIX
ARMORED VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED.  THE AMBUSH WAS STAGED AGAINST
ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS IN CUSCATANCINGO WHO WERE ON THEIR WAY TO
REINFORCE ENEMY POSITIONS UNDER ATTACK IN VARIOUS POINTS OF THE
CAPITAL.  OUR FORCES USED ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND SMALL ARMS FIRE, AS
WELL AS EXPLOSIVES, TO AMBUSH THIS CONVOY, DESTROYING SIX ARMORED
VEHICLES.

   IN ADDITION, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION [FMLN] FIGHTERS
ATTACKED BELLOSO BATTALION TROOPS IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  THE BELLOSO
BATTALION CALLED FOR AIR SUPPORT, WHICH IT RECEIVED, BUT THIS HAS
RESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES BECAUSE THE HELICOPTERS USED HAVE
BEEN BOMBING AND STRAFING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE AYUTUXTEPEQUE
AREA.  THE DESPERATE AIR SUPPORT HAS RESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN
VICTIMS.

   MEANWHILE, FMLN FORCES BEGAN ATTACKING ENEMY POSITIONS IN LOS
SANTOS, BOSQUES DEL RIO, AND UNICENTRO, IN SOYAPANGO.

   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT BARRICADES ARE CONSTANTLY BEING BUILT IN
THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR'S NORTHERN AND
SOUTHERN SECTORS.  THESE ARE BARRICADES BUILT BY YOUTHS, STUDENTS,
WORKERS, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS TO HELP
WITH FOOD AND INFORMATION AND WHO, WITH THEIR OWN HANDS, ARE BUILDING
BARRICADES AND ANSWERING THE CALL OF THE VANGUARD:  THE FMLN.

   WE ARE RECEIVING A REPORT WHICH INDICATES THAT THE FIGHTING WHICH
HAD DECREASED IN THE UNIVERSITY AREA RESUMED AT 0600 THIS MORNING.


TST1-MUC3-0042

   TEGUCIGALPA, 20 DEC 89 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] FOLLOWING THE U.S. INVASION OF GRENADA ISLAND, THE WORLD
DISCARDED ANY FURTHER POSSIBILITY OF A U.S.  ARMED OPERATION AGAINST
ANOTHER NATION OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT, DESPITE THE DETERIORATION OF
ITS RELATIONS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT.  IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE U.S.  WOULD CONFINE ITS
PARTICIPATION TO SUPPORTING AND SPONSORING MOVEMENTS AIMED AT OUSTING
GOVERNMENTS OR, AS IN THE CASE OF NICARAGUA, OF SUPPORTING REBEL
FORCES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS SET BY THE WHITE HOUSE.

   THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING IN PANAMA HAVE
SURPRISED THE WORLD BECAUSE, DESPITE GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S
CHALLENGING ATTITUDE, NO ONE THOUGHT THE U.S. WOULD INVADE PANAMA.
NORIEGA WAS CERTAIN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT DO SO, AND SUPPOSED
THAT U.S. ATTITUDES AGAINST HIM WOULD CONSIST OF SPONSORING REBELLION,
SUCH AS THE RECENT 3-OCTOBER ATTEMPT, WHEN THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT
ENCOURAGED MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES TO REBEL AGAINST
THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF.  NORIEGA NEVER THOUGHT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
WOULD EVER CONDUCT A MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST PANAMA, ALTHOUGH THERE
WERE U.S. TROOPS BASED ON THE CANAL ZONE.  HE CONTINUED UNDER THIS
IMPRESSION BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE HAD THESE TROOPS CHANGED FROM THEIR
ROLE OF SURVEILLANCE, NOT EVEN WHEN WASHINGTON PROMOTED THE REBELLION
OF SOME YOUNG OFFICERS OF THE PANAMANIAN FORCES.

   THIS EXCESSIVE SECURITY DISTRACTED NORIEGA AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO
CHALLENGE THE U.S. POLICIES.  NORIEGA DID NOT BELIEVE THE U.S.
THREATS AND HE ADOPTED AN OMNIPOTENT STANCE, LIKE HIS RECENT DECISION
TO APPOINT HIMSELF THE SUPREME LEADER OF PANAMA.  NORIEGA BELIEVED
THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SUBVERSION IN HIS
COUNTRY, AND THAT THE U.S. DECISION TO SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION
CURRENTLY IN EXILE WOULD PRODUCE MOVEMENTS AGAINST HIS REGIME, OR THAT
A COMMANDO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP HIM.  AS A RESULT OF THIS BELIEF,
HE INCREASED THE STRENGTH OF THE MILITARY FORCES AND EQUIPPED MANY
CIVILIANS WHO SUPPORTED HIM WITH WEAPONS TO BE READY TO DISMANTLE
MOVEMENTS THAT TRIED TO DESTABILIZE HIS GOVERNMENT.

   AS THE CLOCKS STRUCK MIDNIGHT IN PANAMA, THE U.S. FORCES BEGAN AN
OPERATION AGAINST THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCE BARRACKS.  THE TROOPS
ALREADY BASED IN PANAMA, AND THOSE FLOWN IN FROM BASES IN CALIFORNIA
AND IN OTHER CITIES NEAR PANAMA, STARTED A MASSIVE ATTACK TO OUST GEN
NORIEGA.

   THE INVASION, WHICH SEEMED POSSIBLE TO SOME AND TO OTHERS [WORDS
INDISTINCT], WERE MAINLY CONDUCTED TO PUNISH SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN
DECLARED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LATIN AMERICAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY
THE U.S. COURTS.

   EARLY THIS MORNING, SOURCES CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED THAT
THE OPERATION WAS AIMED AT CAPTURING NORIEGA AND TAKING HIM TO THE
UNITED STATES TO BE TRIED FOR THE CRIMES ATTRIBUTED TO HIM BY THE U.S.
COURTS, AT ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TREATIES ON THE PANAMA CANAL,
AND AT RESTORING DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE FARCICAL
MAY-L989 ELECTIONS.

   THESE ARE THE REASONS FOR THE U.S. ARMED INTERVENTION IN PANAMA,
WHICH IS FILLING THE WORLD WITH TREPIDATION DUE TO THE DANGER HOVERING
OVER THE CONTINENT AND THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECISION HAS
GONE BEYOND THE LOGIC OF THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD LATIN AMERICA.

   INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS DID, HOWEVER, GUESS THAT SOMETHING WAS
ABOUT TO OCCUR WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH SAID RECENTLY THAT WHILE THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT COULD REACH AGREEMENT WITH NICARAGUA, WITH NORIEGA IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH ANY AGREEMENT, AND THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD TO
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS VEILED DANGER THAT THREATENED THE AMERICAN
CONTINENT.

   TODAY, PANAMA HAS BECOME A BATTLEFIELD.  THE CAPITAL AND OTHER
CITIES ARE BATTLEFIELDS ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE FIGHTING
THE U.S. UNITS IN GROUND, AIR, AND MARITIME OPERATIONS THAT SEEK TO
OUST MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA.

   THE U.S. ACTION IS FOCUSSING THE WORLD'S ATTENTION ON WASHINGTON'S
DECISION.  MANY NATIONS WILL PROTEST AND REJECT THE U.S. INVASION
WHICH WAS DISGUISED BY A SERIES OF PEACE-SEEKING ACTIONS.

   FOUR DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE, THE GHOST OF WAR IS HAUNTING OUR
CONTINENT.  WE MUST PONDER ON THE NEED TO KEEP HONDURAS ON THE
DEMOCRATIC PATH, AND TO AVOID THE ANARCHY THAT DESTROYS NATIONS AND
DECIMATES PEOPLES.  THE EVENTS THAT HAVE KEPT THE WORLD IN VIGIL SINCE
MIDNIGHT WILL CONTINUE FOR HOURS, DAYS, OR MAYBE WEEKS BECAUSE, SO
FAR, THE NEWS IS VERY CONFUSING AND CIVILIAN VICTIMS ARE DYING ON THE
STREETS OF THE PANAMANIAN TOWNS.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN
COMMANDER SANCHO BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[REPORTER] COMMANDER, DO THE RN LEADERS AGREE THAT THE FMLN SHOULD
EVENTUALLY JOIN THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL [SI] AS HAS BEEN PROPOSED
CONCERNING THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FSLN] IN
NICARAGUA?

   [SANCHO] WE THINK SO, BECAUSE SI HAS REPRESENTED, FOR THE PAST
30-40 YEARS, A EUROPEAN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL BLOC THAT HAS
SUPPORTED THE STRUGGLE....[CORRECTS HIMSELF] THAT HAS SHOWN INTEREST
IN THE THIRD WORLD.  IN OTHER WORDS, WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY
INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL BLOC THAT TRULY WANTS TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS
AND HELP -- WHILE STILL DEFENDING EUROPEAN INTERESTS -- IS VIABLE AND
POSITIVE.  THE FMLN MUST NECESSARILY JOIN THE SI.

   [REPORTER] IN THE 1970'S [WORDS INDISTINCT] STRUGGLE IN OUR COUNTRY
AND THE WAR RESULTED FROM A DECISION ADOPTED BY THE PEOPLE'S
REVOLUTIONARY ARMY [ERP].  VIRTUALLY NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THIS WITHIN
THE FMLN NOW, YET THE RIGHT-WING SECTORS ALWAYS REMEMBER THE RESULTING
SITUATIONS WITHIN THE LEFT-WING SECTORS.  WHAT DOES THE RN THINK ABUT
THE ERP IN 1990?

   [SANCHO] WE HAVE STATED AND WE HAVE PUT IT IN WRITING -- IT IS GOOD
TO HAVE IT IN WRITING -- THAT THE LEFT BECAME DIVIDED AND THE ERP
BECAME DIVIDED BECAUSE WE WERE NOT FIRM ENOUGH, POLITICALLY AND
IDEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ERP LEADERSHIP ACTED
CHILDISHLY [WORDS INDISTINCT], BUT WE CAN NOW SAY THAT WE HAVE
ACHIEVED MATURITY IN EVERY SECTOR.  THE OPTIONS WE HAVE CHOSEN WITHIN
THE FMLN HAVE ALLOWED US TO CLEARLY SEE THE OUTCOME OF THE DECISIONS
WE ADOPTED IN THE PAST.

   THIS HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN [WORD INDISTINCT] AND MISCONSTRUED BY THE
ENEMY IN ITS PROPAGANDA AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR, BECAUSE IT LOVES TO SAY
THAT REVOLUTIONARIES ALWAYS END UP KILLING EACH OTHER.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THE IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] INDICATES THAT
WE [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND UNITY HAS PREVAILED WITHIN THE FMLN.  WE
CONSIDER THE DIVISION A PROCESS THAT IS PART OF EL SALVADOR'S HISTORY
AND WE SHOULD NOT CRY OVER SPILT MILK.  NO ONE SHOULD DEPLORE....
[CHANGES THOUGHT] WE CANNOT SPECULATE ON WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.  IT
WAS THE RESULT OF OUR IMMATURITY.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER, EVERYONE KNOWS THE NAMES OF THE FMLN LEADERS
-- PARTICULARLY THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL COMMAND -- BUT THIS IS
SOMETHING NEW.  YOU WERE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS FERMAN CIENFUEGOS AND NOT
EVERYONE KNEW THAT YOU WERE EDUARDO SANCHO COLOMBARI.  THERE IS ALWAYS
A CLANDESTINE ELEMENT INVOLVED.  WHY IS THERE ALWAYS A TENDENCY TO
REMAIN ANONYMOUS?

   [SANCHO] I THINK THAT AFTER 10 OR 20 YEARS IN HIDING WE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] POLITICAL CONDUCT THAT DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO MODERN TIMES
AND OUR POLITICAL NEEDS.  THEREFORE, THE GENERAL COMMAND NEEDS [WORDS
INDISTINCT] SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, MEANING THE NEED FOR THE GENERAL
COMMAND MEMBERS TO GO PUBLIC.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE GENERAL COMMAND
MEMBERS SHOULD GO PUBLIC AND STATE THEIR VIEWS SO THAT THEY PEOPLE CAN
LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM, THEIR HUMAN SIDE, AND THEIR PERSONALITIES.  IT
IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE WORLD TO KNOW ABOUT THE LEADERS'
PERSONALITIES AS THEY ARE.  THIS HAS BEEN -- LET US CALL IT A DEFECT
OR LIMITATION.  SECRECY IS A DEVIATION AND A PERSON CAN MAINTAIN....
[CORRECTS HIMSELF] COMBINE SECRECY WITH OUR POLITICAL ROLE.  WE NOW WE
HAVE TO OVERCOME THAT DEVIATION, MEANING SECRECY AND ANONYMITY.

   [REPORTER] YES.

   [SANCHO] I BELIEVE WE ARE TRYING TO OVERCOME THIS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] WE NOW HAVE
COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ ON THE TELEPHONE.  THE ARMED FORCES,
PARTICULARLY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VARIOUS ARMY BRANCHES AND GARRISONS
WHO WERE CONVENED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER, MADE A STATEMENT AGAINST
THIS OFFICER, WHO IS A DEPUTY AND THE CURRENT CEL [LEMPA RIVER
HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] PRESIDENT, AFTER HE DEMANDED
JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE WILL NOW
LISTEN TO COL OCHOA, WHO WILL MAKE KNOWN HIS STAND SINCE THE ARMED
FORCES' STATEMENT WAS RELEASED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] GOOD MORNING, COLONEL.

   [OCHOA] GOOD MORNING. THANKS, RAUL.  THESE GENTLEMEN SEEM TO BE
SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES.  I KNOW WELL WHAT WAS
DISCUSSED IN THE MEETING. SOMEONE EVEN SAID THAT THE BRIGHT IDEA OF
DISCHARGING ME WAS CONSIDERED.  THEY FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT,
HOWEVER, THAT I AM A DEPUTY AND THAT, AS A DEPUTY AND A CITIZEN, I AM
ENTITLED TO EXPRESS WHAT I FEEL, JUST AS I HAVE DONE.  I, WHO OWE
EVERYTHING TO THE ARMED FORCES, WHO FOUGHT BESIDE THE SOLDIERS AS
MONTERROSA, CARLITOS, AND VERY FEW OTHERS DID, NEVER GOT RICH WHEN IN
THE ARMED FORCES, AS SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF
THEM, OF COURSE.  THIS UNDOUBTEDLY HAS IRRITATED THEM.

   I HAVE SIMPLY EXPRESSED MY VIEWPOINT AS A SOLDIER CONCERNED ABOUT
THE ARMED FORCES' SITUATION.  I NEVER MENTIONED ANY NAMES.  I SIMPLY
DEMANDED JUSTICE BECAUSE, EVEN ACCORDING TO MILITARY THEORY, I CANNOT
CONCEIVE THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT DECISION COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY A
SINGLE PERSON.  I STILL THINK THIS IS A PLOT BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE
INSTITUTION, NOT BY THE ARMED FORCES AS SUCH.  I ONLY HAVE RESPECT AND
LOVE FOR THE ARMED FORCES.  I AM CONCERNED OVER THE DELICATE SITUATION
TO WHICH THE INSTITUTION COULD BE LED BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF SOME
NEFARIOUS MEMBERS.  I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR THE OFFICERS IN THE FIELD,
WHO FIGHT EVERY DAY.  OF COURSE, I MUST CRITICIZE THOSE WHO HAVE
PROFITED FROM THE INSTITUTION AND WHO TODAY HAVE RAISED THE ROOF, AS
IF I WERE THE ONE TO BLAME AND AS IF I WERE UNDERMINING THE
INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE.  QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.  MY
CRITICISM IS POSITIVE AND INTENDS TO ENCOURAGE A DEEPER INVESTIGATION
AND EXHAUST ALL RESOURCES IN THIS DIRECTION.  I WOULD LIKE THEM TO
STOP MAKING RIDICULOUS DEMANDS AND TO STOP SEEKING A CONFRONTATION.
IT IS KNOWN THAT WHAT I AM DEMANDING IS WHAT IS BEING FELT AND SAID.
I AM NOT ACCUSING ANYONE IN PARTICULAR.  I AM ONLY DEMANDING JUSTICE.
COMMANDERS' MEETINGS SHOULD NOT BE HELD TO MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT.
THEY SHOULD HAVE INSTEAD SHOWN THEIR CONCERN OVER THE ARMED FORCES'
SITUATION.  I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING THEM TAKE THE
STAND TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO THE LAST CONSEQUENCES.  AS THE
MILITARY MAN I AM, I ONLY ASSESSED THE SITUATION.  I NEVER MENTIONED
ANY NAMES, BUT INSISTED THAT A DEEPER INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO CARRY
OUT JUSTICE, BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT IS THE INSTITUTION THAT WILL SUFFER.

   [REPORTER] COL OCHOA, AFTER THE "SIXTY MINUTES" PROGRAM ON CBS IN
THE UNITED STATES, IT SEEMS THAT IN THIS CAPITAL AND IN THE COUNTRY
YOUR REMARKS AND YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE JESUITS' CASE WERE
DISTORTED.  TODAY THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO ACCUSE YOU. IT HAS BEEN
SAID THAT THE CUT IN U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES IS THE
RESULT OF YOUR REMARKS, RATHER THAN OF THE SLOWNESS IN THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE JEUSIT PRIESTS' CASE.  DO YOU THINK THERE HAS
BEEN ILL INTENT IN THIS, OR THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF YOU TO TRY TO JUSTIFY AN ACTION?

   [OCHOA] I THINK SO. THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO BLAME ME, AS IF I
COULD INFLUENCE THE DECISION-MAKING OF THE U.S. CONGRESS.  A REDUCTION
IN MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR MONTHS
BECAUSE THE EXPECTED RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN OBTAINED.  I THINK IT IS
RIDICULOUS AND CHILDISH TO SAY THAT THE AID WILL BE CUT AS THE RESULT
OF MY REMARKS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL CRIMES WITH WHICH SOME ARMED
FORCES' MEMBERS HAVE JEOPARDIZED THE INSTITUTION SHOULD BE PUNISHED.
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOLIDARITY SHOULD EXIST IN THE CONTEXT OF
OPERATIONS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES' CONSTITUTIONAL
MISSION.  HOWEVER, THOSE WHO HARM THE INSTITUTION SHOULD NOT BE
PROTECTED.

   I THINK SOME ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION, AS IF
TO SAY: COL OCHOA HAS ENDANGERED THE ARMED FORCES.  WHAT HAS
ENDANGERED THE INSTITUTION IS THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS AND THE SAN
SEBASTIAN PEOPLE.  I CANOT AGREE WITH THE PERPETRATION OF OUTRAGES.
ONE THING IS TO FIGHT FAIRLY WITH THE ENEMY.  THERE ARE DEAD IN EVERY
WAR.  I SAID THIS VERY CLEARLY WHEN I WAS 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE
COMMANDER IN CABANAS.  I AGREED WITH THE PENETRATION INTO THE
POPULATION TO HELP THEM.  I FEEL SATISFIED OVER MY PASSAGE THROUGH THE
ARMED FORCES AS A COMMANDER, BECAUSE I IDENTIFIED MYSELF BOTH WITH MY
MEN AND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  AT NO TIME DID I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THE INSTITUTION TO ACQUIRE ILLEGAL RICHES.  TO POINT THESE THINGS OUT
IS NOT TO ATTACK THE ARMED FORCES.  QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS BECAUSE
I LOVE IT THAT I HAVE CRITICIZED THE NEGATIVE MEMBERS.  THE ARMED
FORCES CAN THUS BE SPARED GREATER DAMAGE BY THE POOR ACTIONS OF SOME
OF ITS MEMBERS.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, IN THE PAST FEW HOURS WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS
THAT YOU ARE TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE ARMY'S YOUNGER OFFICERS AND SOME
UNIONS, EVEN THE CEL UNION.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THIS
SITUATION?  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY THE SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTRY FLATLY DENIED CHARGES RAISED YESTERDAY BY AN ALLEGED
"JUNIOR OFFICERS' COMMAND" THAT BLAMES CERTAIN OFFICERS OF THE ARMED
FORCES FOR THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CATEGORICALLY
REJECTED "ALL TYPES OF SLANDER AND CHARGES AGAINST ITS MEMBERS,"
REFERRING TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED DOCUMENT THAT IT SAID "LACKS ALL LOGIC
AND CREDIBILITY."

   THE OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE POINTED OUT THAT "IN THESE MOMENTS, THE
ARMED FORCES ARE UNITED MORE THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE DEFENSE OF THE
FATHERLAND," ADDING THAT THE DOCUMENT ANONYMOUSLY DISTRIBUTED
YESTERDAY TO THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS IS "GREY PROPAGANDA."

   IN THE FOUR-PAGE DOCUMENT, A SO-CALLED "JUNIOR OFFICERS' COMMAND"
STATES THAT "COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, CHIEF OF THE TREASURY
POLICE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE (JESUITS') MURDERS."

   THE AUTHORS OF THE COMMUNIQUE ADD THAT THE "TROOPS FROM THAT
SECURITY CORPS LED BY CAPTAIN ALONSO CHAVEZ GARCIA" CARRIED OUT THE
EXECUTIONS," BUT IT DID NOT PROVIDE ANY DETAILS TO BACK UP THE
ACCUSATIONS.

   THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO MORE PERSONS WERE KILLED ON 16 NOVEMBER,
SHOT DURING THE NIGHT BY A GROUP OF ARMED INDIVIDUALS WEARING MILITARY
UNIFORMS, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES OF THE CRIME.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION, INVITING
FOREIGN EXPERTS TO PARTICIPATE.

   THE OFFICIAL DEFENSE MINISTRY NOTE WARNED THAT "THE FORCE THAT
MAINTAINS THIS SOLID UNITY (OF THE ARMED FORCES) IS THE BLOOD SHED BY
OUR SOLDIERS TO DEFEND THE FATHERLAND AND OUR IDEAS, CUSTOMS,
RELIGION, DEMOCRACY, AND FREEDOM."

   THE MINISTRY'S COMMUNIQUE URGES THE CITIZENS "NOT TO ALLOW
THEMSELVES TO BE DECEIVED BY THE AMOUNT OF RUMORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
PRESSURES THAT THE MARXIST BOOKS OF THEORY CLEARLY DEFINE AS A FORM OF
STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE POWER."

   THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO DISCLOSES THAT FORMER CAPTAIN MAURICIO MENA
SANDOVAL, WHO JOINED THE GUERRILLAS IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES, HAS MADE
TELEPHONE CALLS OR SENT "PERSONAL NOTES" TO CHIEFS OR OFFICERS.

   "THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS RESORT TO THIS TYPE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL
TACTICS WHEN THEY FEEL THEY ARE LOST OR DESPERATE," THE COMMUNIQUE
ADDS, REFERRING TO THE FAILURE OF THE OFFENSIVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS
LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER.  


TST1-MUC3-0046

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 JUL 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [TEXT] THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE A FEW HOURS
AGO DENYING THAT IT DIRECTED AN ATTACK AGAINST SUPREME COURT OF
JUSTICE PRESIDENT MAURICIO GUTIERREZ CASTRO.

   THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE READS: ON THE AFTERNOON OF 2 JULY, FMLN
GUERRILLAS CARRIED OUT PROPAGANDA ACTIVITY AND OCCUPIED 8 KM OF THE
ROAD TO LA LIBERTAD PORT, BETWEEN THE 14- AND 21-KM MARKERS, WHERE
THEY ERECTED A BARRICADE.  THE GUERRILLAS ADDED THAT THEY STOPPED
APPROXIMATELY 200 VEHICLES TO MEET AND EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH THE
DRIVERS.

   AT THE 14-KM MARKER, A VEHICLE IN WHICH (ROBERTO MATIS REGALADO'S)
BODYGUARDS WERE RIDING ARRIVED, BUT THE DRIVER DID NOT OBEY THE ORDER
TO STOP, WHICH PROVOKED A CLASH WITH OUR UNITS.  TWO MEN WERE WOUNDED
AND ONE WOMAN WAS KILLED AS A RESULT OF THAT INCIDENT.

   OUR FORCES REPORTED THAT THEY SEIZED ONE M-16 RIFLE AND ONE .45 -
CALIBER PISTOL.  THE FMLN DOCUMENT ADDS THAT MINUTES LATER, AT THE
21-KM MARKER, THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT'S BODYGUARDS
TRIED TO SURPRISE OUR FIGHTERS AND ANOTHER CLASH OCCURRED. DURING THE
CLASH, ONE BODYGUARD WAS KILLED AND THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE] OFFICIAL WAS WOUNDED.

   PARAGRAPH THREE OF THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THE ARMED PROPAGANDA
ACTIVITIES ALONG THE LA LIBERTAD PORT - SAN SALVADOR ROUTE ARE AIMED
AT DISTRIBUTING PROPAGANDA AND AT DESTABILIZING THIS VITAL ROUTE USED
BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND MILITARY MEN TO TRAVEL TO THEIR PRIVATE
CLUBS LOCATED ALONG THE COAST.

   THE FMLN, THE DOCUMENT ADDS, REITERATES ITS DETERMINATION TO STOP
THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE GENOCIDAL WAR -- THOSE WHO EVERY DAY
SHELL THE RURAL AREAS AND PERSECUTE AND MURDER PEASANTS, WORKERS, AND
STUDENTS -- FROM TAKING IT EASY AND RELAXING AT THEIR CLUBS AND IN
THEIR EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL POLICE
STATION AT THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD FOLLOWS THIS
SAME LINE OF DESTABILIZATION.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON OUR PEOPLE TO PAY
ATTENTION TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ORDERS ISSUED BY OUR FIGHTERS AND
TO THEREBY PREVENT REGRETTABLE LOSSES.  WE WARN BODYGUARDS AND
SECURITY GUARDS THAT WE WILL FIGHT THOSE WHO ARE ARMED AND WHO OFFER
RESISTANCE.

   IN CONCLUSION, THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE RELEASED A FEW HOURS AGO ADDS:
WE REITERATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ABIDE BY OUR REVOLUTIONARY
PRINCIPLES AND STICK TO THE TRUTH.  WE DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN
INCIDENTS SUCH AS THE ATTACK AGAINST [PRESIDENCY MINISTER] ANTONIO
RODRIGUEZ PORTH AND EDGAR CHACON [IDEOLOGUE OF THE ORLANDO DE SOLA
GROUP].  THESE INCIDENTS RESULTED FROM A WAR WITHIN ARENA RANKS, AND
WE WARN THAT ACTS OF REPRESSION UNLEASHED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST
THE POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED AND WILL
RECEIVE A STRONG RESPONSE FROM OUR FORCES.

   THIS WAS THE RECENT FMLN COMMUNIQUE ON THE INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED
ON 2 JULY ON THE ROAD TO LA LIBERTAD PORT, WHERE THE PRESIDENT OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE WAS WOUNDED.

   QUITO, 26 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] ECUADOR TODAY CONCEDED THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MAY BE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN ECUADORAN
TERRITORY, ALTHOUGH IT EMPHASIZED THAT BORDER CONTROLS HAVE BEEN
REINFORCED "TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF VIOLENCE AND TERROR."

   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE PRESENCE OF MEMBERS OF THE MEDELLIN
CARTEL, INTERIOR MINISTER ANDRES VALLEJO SAID: "IT IS POSSIBLE.
HOWEVER, THERE ARE QUITE RELIABLE REPORTS THAT THEY (THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS) HAVE MORE LIKELY FLED TO OTHER COUNTRIES."

   THE MINISTER REVEALED THAT A FINANCING COMPANY, WHICH HE DID NOT
IDENTIFY, WAS CLOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT WAS FOUND TO BE
LAUNDERING DOLLARS OBTAINED FROM THE TRAFFICKING.  "THERE WILL BE NO
MERCY IN SUCH CASES," HE SAID.

   OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, PRESS REPORTS MENTIONED ECUADOR AS ONE OF
THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE TOP LEADERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAD
REPORTEDLY TAKEN REFUGE TO ESCAPE THE ACTIONS LAUNCHED BY THE
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING A SERIES OF ASSASSINATIONS COMMITTED BY
THE DRUG MAFIAS.  EARLY THIS WEEK, ECUADOR REINFORCED ITS EXTENSIVE
BORDER WITH COLOMBIA TO KEEP THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS OUT.

   ASSESSING THE STATUS OF DRUGS IN ECUADOR, THE MINISTER ADMITTED
THAT "SEVERAL LARGE ESTATES HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY PEOPLE WHO APPEAR
TO BE LINKED TO THE DRUG TRAFFIC."  HOWEVER, HE EXPRESSED THE OPINION
THAT THESE PURCHASES WERE LINKED TO MONEY LAUNDERING RATHER THAN THE
PRODUCTION OF DRUGS.

   VALLEJO ALSO SAID THAT ECUADOR HAS "SEVERELY" RESTRICTED IMPORTS OF
CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES USED IN THE PRELIMINARY PHASES OF THE REFINING OF
NARCOTICS.  FORMER FREE ACCESS TO THOSE SUBSTANCES HAD BEEN CONVERTING
THE COUNTRY INTO AN ALTERNATIVE BASE FOR THE PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT
OF DRUGS TO THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE.

   BOGOTA, 6 JUN 89 (EMISORAS CARACOL NETWORK) -- [TEXT] PASTO --
COMMERCE AT THE ECUADORAN BORDER IS VIRTUALLY PARALYZED AFTER THE
BORDER WAS CLOSED IN THE WAKE OF SERIOUS INCIDENTS BETWEEN STRIKING
TRANSPORTERS AND ECUADORAN POLICE.

   ONE PERSON WAS KILLED IN TULCAN, CARCHI PROVINCE.  MEANWHILE, THE
SITUATION REMAINS TENSE IN THE REST OF ECUADOR BECAUSE OF THE
PROLONGED STRIKE OF DRIVERS WHO ARE PROTESTING AGAINST DRASTIC
ECONOMIC MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT RODRIGO
BORJA.

   AS A RESULT, COMMERCE BETWEEN TULCAN AND IPIALES, THE TWO MOST
ACTIVE CITIES AT THE BORDER, IS VIRTUALLY PARALYZED.

   POPAYAN, 23 MAR 90 (BOGOTA RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] MEMBERS
OF THE 8TH FRONT OF THE SELF-STYLED REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF
COLOMBIA [FARC] HAVE CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN SOUTHERN CAUCA
DEPARTMENT TO PROTEST PATRIOTIC UNION [UP] PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA'S MURDER.

   THE FARC MEMBERS BLEW UP A POWER SUBSTATION AND A POWER PYLON IN
SAJANDI, LA FONDA CORREGIMIENTO.  THE GUERRILLAS ALSO BURNED THREE
VEHICLES ON THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY-- A BALBOA HOSPITAL AMBULANCE, A
FUEL TRUCK CARRYING 3,000 GALLONS OF GASOLINE, AND A STATION WAGON.  A
LARGE SECTION OF EL PATIA VALLEY WAS LEFT WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.

   THROUGH SEVERAL TELEPHONE CALLS TO THE POPAYAN MEDIA, THE 8TH FARC
FRONT DECLARED THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY A MILITARY TARGET DURING THE
NEXT 48 HOURS IN ORDER TO DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATE AND
ARREST THOSE WHO ARE TRULY RESPONSIBLE FOR JARAMILLO'S MURDER.

   TRANSPORTATION SERVICES BETWEEN [WORD INDISTINCT] AND PASTO IN
SOUTHERN COLOMBIA HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST
ATTACKS, WHICH BEGAN AT 0300 TODAY.

   POLICE AND 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE MEMBERS WERE DEPLOYED TO THE AREAS
WHERE THE 8TH FRONT OF THE SELF-STYLED REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF
COLOMBIA BLOCKED TRAFFIC. THE 8TH FARC FRONT MEMBERS SAID THEIR
MILITARY ACTIONS ARE AIMED AT DEMANDING THE CLARIFICATION OF UP
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO'S MURDER.

   THE POPAYAN POLICE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMED THAT THE ATTACKS TOOK PLACE
ON THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY AND AT LA FONDA CORREGIMIENTO, PATIA
MUNICIPALITY.

   GOVERNOR FERNANDO IRACONI SAID THAT THE REGIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL
WILL MEET IN POPAYAN IN A FEW MINUTES TO ASSESS THE MOST RECENT
TERRORIST ATTACKS AND TO ADOPT THE NECESSARY MEASURES.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 16 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] PANAMA'S
ARCHBISHOP MARCOS MCGRATH, PANAMA'S EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE PRESIDENT
JOSE LUIS LACUNZA, AND PANAMANIAN ABDIEL ADAMES, PRESIDENT OF THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN HIGHER UNIVERSITY COUNCIL (CSUCA), HAVE CONDEMNED THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS IN EL SALVADOR AT DAWN TODAY.

   MCGRATH, WHO DESCRIBED THE MULTIPLE ASSASSINATION AS "MONSTROUS,"
POINTED OUT THAT "IT IS EVERYBODY'S DUTY, ESPECIALLY OF THAT COUNTRY'S
GOVERNMENT, TO IDENTIFY, ARREST, AND TRY THE CULPRITS AND THOSE WHO
ORDERED THE ACTION."

   THIS "MUST NOT ONLY BE A JUST TRIAL OF THEM, BUT ALSO A MEANS TO
ELOQUENTLY EXPRESS THE REJECTION OF THE ENTIRE SOCIETY, WHICH CALLS
ITSELF CHRISTIAN, AGAINST SUCH A CRUEL AND UNJUST CRIME THAT REVEALS
ABSOLUTE CONTEMPT FOR HUMAN LIFE," A COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ARCHBISHOP
MCGRATH STATES.

   ACCORDING TO SOURCES FROM EL SALVADOR'S JESUIT CURIA, THE SPANISH
JESUIT IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF EL SALVADOR'S CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY (UCA), FIVE OTHER PRIESTS, AND TWO SALVADORAN WOMEN WERE
MURDERED AT DAWN TODAY BY MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.

   IN THE OPINION OF SPANISH BISHOP JOSE LUIS LACUNZA, SECRETARY OF
PANAMA'S EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE AND RECTOR OF SANTA MARIA LA ANTIGUA
UNIVERSITY, "THESE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED WITH MALICE AND IN
COLD BLOOD."  "THEY ARE CERTAINLY TO BE CONDEMNED, REGARDLESS OF WHO
CARRIED THEM OUT," HE ADDED.

   CSUCA PRESIDENT PANAMANIAN ABDIEL ADAMES DESCRIBED AS "ABOMINABLE"
AND "REPREHENSIBLE" THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN.

   ADAMES, WHO IS ALSO RECTOR OF PANAMA'S NATIONAL UNIVERSITY,
REJECTED THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE "AS A MEANS TO REACH AGREEMENTS IN
EL SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT PRIESTS HAVE BEEN KILLED."

   CSUCA WILL ASK THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO DECLARE UCA A
"SANCTUARY" OR "NEUTRAL ZONE" TO TREAT THOSE WOUNDED IN THE CLASHES
BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE 11
NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER TOWNS, ADAMES POINTED OUT.

   CSUCA COORDINATOR AND SALVADORAN GUILLERMO GALVAN SAID TODAY IN SAN
JOSE (COSTA RICA) THAT HE ASKED PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS TO "MEDIATE TO
BRING ABOUT A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND STEP UP EFFORTS
TO PREVENT "MASSACRES" AND "SELECTIVE MURDERS."

   BOGOTA, 4 FEB 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH NORTH
SANTANDER GOVERNOR EDUARDO ASSAF ELCURE BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] [ASSAF] I BELIEVE THAT HERE IN THE DEPARTMENT, THE
EXPERIENCE WITH MAYORS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, HAS BEEN SATISFACTORY.
MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE TO THE COMMUNITIES THEY REPRESENT.
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING AND ALL HAVE A FAVORABLE BALANCE.  WHY NOT
ALLOW CITIZENS TO FREELY AND SPONTANEOUSLY EXCERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE
AGAIN.  THIS WOULD CONTINUE THE DEMOCRATIZATION AND DECENTRALIZATION
PROCESS NEEDED BY THE COUNTRY TO PROGRESS AND FIND PEACE.  I BELIEVE
WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WONDERFUL SERVICES RENDERED BY DR.
RAFAEL PARDO, THE NATIONAL REHABILITATION PLAN DIRECTOR, TO ATTEMPT TO
FIND NEW ROADS TOWARD ACHIEVING DIALOGUE WITH THESE TWO SECTORS,
ESPECIALLY WITH THE ELN.  IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND PEACE, ESPECIALLY FOR
THIS DEPARTMENT.  WE MUST AT LEAST MAKE ATTEMPTS TO HOLD DIALOGUE WITH
THIS GUERRILLA GROUP, WHICH HAS SHOWN IT CAN EASILY MOVE AROUND AND
DISRUPT STABILITY AND PUBLIC ORDER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF NORTH
SANTANDER.

   [REPORTER] MR. GOVERNOR, UP TO NOW, HAVE ELN OR EPL SUBVERSIVES
TRIED TO ATTAIN THIS DIALOGUE?

   [ASSAF] WELL, NO.  IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY, BESIDES WE BELIEVE THESE
ARE INITIATIVES THAT SHOULD BE STARTED BY THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS, AS
THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE IN SUCH CONVERSATIONS, CONTACTS, AND DIALOGUES.
THAT IS WHY I MENTIONED THAT, PERHAPS, THROUGH DR. RAFAEL PARDO, WHO
HAS BEEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S DELEGATE, ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE TO
SEARCH FOR SUCH POSSIBILITIES.  I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN
MAKING EFFORTS TO ATTAIN PEACE IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE QUICKER WE
ATTAIN THIS, THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF
COLOMBIA.

   [REPORTER] HAVE YOU ALREADY SENT AN INVITATION OR ASKED DR.  RAFAEL
PARDO TO COME TO YOUR DEPARTMENT?

   [ASSAF] WE HAVE TALKED TO HIM OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ABOUT THE
PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION AND OTHER SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL
ATTENTION.  HOWEVER, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY KNOWS THAT DR. PARDO HAS BEEN
WORKING VIRTUALLY FULL-TIME TO FURTHER THE PEACE CONVERSATIONS WITH
M-19.  THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PLEASED AND VERY HAPPY WITH THESE
CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT INITIATION FOR
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S PEACE PROCESS.

   [REPORTER] BUT DR. RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA DOES NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA OF
HOLDING SUCH CONVERSATIONS?

   [ASSAF] I AM SURE HE DOES NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN
TRYING TO DO THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

   [REPORTER] WHEN COULD THESE CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE?  JUST GIVE US
A TENTATIVE DATE.  COULD IT BE WITHIN DAYS OR THIS WEEK?

   [ASSAF] SURELY THIS WEEK WE WILL AGAIN HAVE TO STUDY THE PUBLIC
ORDER SITUATION IN OUR DEPARTMENT AND SURELY WE WILL BE ABLE TO
ANALYZE THIS PROPOSAL AGAIN AND I BELIEVE DR. PARDO WILL SERIOUSLY
TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT.

   [REPORTER] SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LEADERS -- NOT ONLY IN
NORTHERN SANTANDER, BUT IN SEVERAL AREAS OF THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY
CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSTANT RAIDS BY SUBVERSIVE GROUPS, AND THEIR
MURDERED MAYORS, OFFICIALS, AND POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE KIDNAPPING
OF NATIONAL CIVIL REGISTRY OFFICE PERSONNEL.  THEY INDICATE THAT WITH
ACTIONS OF THIS TYPE IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO FREELY
EXPRESS THEMSELVES BY VOTING IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS.

   [ASSAF] YES, SURELY ALL THESE INCIDENTS CAN, IN A CERTAIN MANNER,
WEAKEN THE ELECTORAL VOTE.  HOWEVER, EVERYDAY WE ARE MORE CONVINCED
THAT COLOMBIANS WANT TO EXCERCISE THIS RIGHT WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF
LIMITATIONS AND MAKE EFFORTS -- INCLUDING HEROIC ACTIONS -- TO
CONTINUE THIS CAMPAIGN SO THAT ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD THROUGHOUT THE
NATIONAL TERRITORY.  VOTING IS THE REAL EXPRESSION OF DEMOCRACY AND WE
WILL ALL FIGHT FOR IT.  WE ARE SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE
ARMED FORCES, WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FOR THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS
TO BE HELD WITHOUT PROBLEMS.  HOWEVER, IT IS A HUGE EFFORT, AS IT HAS
TO CONFRONT A SERIES OF APPREHENSIONS OR FEARS THAT HAVE BEEN
INSTILLED IN SOME PEOPLE.  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- [INTERVIEW WITH COMMANDER JORGE MELENDEZ]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] [MELENDEZ] COL VARGAS' REACTION WAS TO BECOME
DESPERATE BECAUSE 90-MM, 60-MM, AND 81-MM MORTARS, AND 85-MM FIELD
GUNS HAVE BEEN INDISCRIMINATELY FIRED AGAINST THAT SECTOR OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 3 DAYS; ROCKETS HAVE BEEN FIRED FROM AIRPLANES.  MANY
CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AND MANY HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.  IN
OTHER WORDS, THERE HAS BEEN NO RESPECT WHATSOEVER -- PERHAPS BECAUSE
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE LOCATED CLOSEST TO THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE,
AND THAT SEEMS TO WORRY THIS MAN VERY MUCH.  THIS COULD BE THE REASON
FOR SUCH AN ATTITUDE AND FOR THAT GENOCIDAL SITUATION.

   IN OTHER PLACES, CLASHES OCCURRED PRACTICALLY ALL DAY LONG ON 12
AND 13 NOVEMBER, AND DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF 14 NOVEMBER IN
THE MILAGRO DE LA PAZ NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE WE CAUSED A CONSIDERABLE
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES.  IN ADDITION, OUR FORCES FOILED AND STOPPED THE
ARCE BATTALION, PONCE BATTALION, LEON BATTALION, AND THE MONTERROSA
FORCES [78-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] SURVEILLANCE AND
SECURITY MEASURES, AND TO HANDLE ANY TYPE OF EMERGENCY, INCLUDING
BOMBINGS, MORTAR ATTACKS, AND STRAFINGS.  THIS MEANS THAT THE TERRAIN
MUST BE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE POPULATION.

   WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF INSTRUCTION REGARDING THE TASKS TO BE DONE
DURING TIMES OF COMBAT, BUT THIS IS GEARED TOWARD THE POPULATION WHO
DECIDES TO PARTICIPATE BY DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE FMLN.  THIS INVOLVES
MANY PEOPLE.  THEY CAN JOIN NEW FORCES AND GROUPS IN CHARGE OF THE
TRENCHES, SECURITY MEASURES, COURIERS, AND ALL KINDS OF TASKS TO
SUPPORT THE WAR.

   IN SUM, THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE POPULATION ARE TO ORGANIZE
THEMSELVES BECAUSE, ONCE ORGANIZED, THEY CAN GIVE [4-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] AND COUNTER IT.  THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE CALLS TO
THE POPULATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STRUGGLE AND ABOVE ALL [7-SECOND
BREAK IN RECEPTION] NOT TO LET ANYONE INTIMIDATE THEM.  THEY
SHOULD NOT LET ANYONE STOP THEM FROM GOING OUT TO PURCHASE THEIR FOOD
AND WHATEVER ELSE THEY NEED.

   GIVEN THE EMERGENCY SITUATION AND THE SHORTAGE OF MEDICINE AND
FOOD, WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL TO OPEN
THE STORES WHERE THEY CAN GET FOOD, MEDICINE, AND ANY OTHER ITEMS
WHICH ARE URGENTLY NEEDED FOR THEIR [WORD INDISTINCT] AND SURVIVAL.
THAT IS ALL FOR NOW.  GREETINGS TO THE COMRADES WHO ARE LISTENING IN
THE CAPITAL, ALL THE COMRADE FIGHTERS, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE IN
GENERAL.  THEIR HIGH MORALE AND ACTIVE ROLE IN THE CAPITAL MAKES US
FEEL PROUD.  WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE VICTORY IS GUARANTEED.  WE ARE
PREPARED TO DO LIKEWISE AND WE SEND THEM THE COURAGEOUS, FRATERNAL,
AND REVOLUTIONARY GREETINGS FROM ALL THE COMMANDERS AND FIGHTERS IN
SAN MIGUEL.

   LIMA, 15 AUG 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING. THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN IS
NOW UNDER WAY.  TEN CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF LIMA.  WE MUST
PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.

   HOWEVER, THE ELECTORAL ATMOSPHERE THAT PREVAILS SHOULD NOT MAKE US
FORGET OUR MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR
FATHERLAND. THIS THREAT IS TERRORISM WHICH COSTS LIVES, INFLICTS
ECONOMIC HARM, FOSTERS INSECURITY, AND CUTS OFF THE POWER THAT WE NEED
FOR OUR HOMES AND OUR INDUSTRIES.

   WE CONTINUE TO BATTLE TERRORISM. THE ARMED FORCES AND THE NATIONAL
POLICE ARE TAKING DRASTIC ACTION IN THE HUALLAGA VALLEY AND IN THE
MOUNTAIN RANGE.  THEY ARE ALSO BREAKING UP URBAN TERRORIST CELLS.
HOWEVER, WE MUST ALSO ATTACK TERRORISTS THROUGH LEGAL ACTIONS, THROUGH
THE MOST DRASTIC AND SEVERE SENTENCES.

   IRRESPECTIVE OF MILITARY ACTIONS, IF NO SWIFT AND DRASTIC LEGAL
PUNISHMENT IS METED, THE TERRORISTS KNOW THAT THEY WILL GO UNPUNISHED.
STIMULATED BY THIS THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR CRIMES.

   THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS AWARE OF THIS. MOST PERUVIANS WANT SEVERE,
DRASTIC AND EFFECTIVE PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS. THUS, ON 28 JULY I
PROPOSED TO THE NATIONAL CONGRESS THAT THE MILITARY COURTS SHOULD TRY
TERRORISTS. TONIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THIS SUBJECT
BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED THAT IT MAY REMAIN JUST THAT; A PROPOSAL. I
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK ALL PERUVIANS, ALL ORGANIZATIONS AND
INSTITUTIONS, TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN
CONGRESS.

   BY HAVING TERRORISTS TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WE ARE NOT GIVING UP
ANY CIVILIAN PREROGATIVES. WE ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS.
THIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE IN OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.

   FURTHERMORE, THE ARMED FORCES ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF PERU'S
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY FIGHT THE
BATTLE AGAINST SUBVERSION. NO ONE CAN SAY THAT SETTING UP MILITARY
COURTS IS TANTAMOUNT TO MILITARIZING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT WOULD
IMPLY DISTRUSTING THE ARMED FORCES, OFFENDING THEM AND OVERLOOKING THE
FACT THAT THEY ARE DEFENDING DEMOCRACY. MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO WE ASKED
FOR AND WERE ALLOWED TO ESTABLISH SPECIAL COURTS TO TERRORIST CASES.
SO FAR THESE COURTS HAVE YIELDED NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THUS, AS
PRESIDENT IT IS MY DUTY TO CALL FOR SEVERE SENTENCES, ISSUED WITHOUT
DELAY OR ANY THEORETICAL OR ACADEMIC DISCUSSIONS.

   FOLLOWING MY 28 JULY SPEECH I ASCERTAINED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF
PERUVIANS ARE IN FAVOR OF DRASTIC PUNISHMENTS AND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF MILITARY COURTS. I HAVE ALSO HEARD SOME LEGAL OBJECTIONS AND
THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS MEASURE.

   THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT THE MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS SAY
THAT ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW IT. THIS IS HALF
TRUE.  ARTICLE 282 STATES: IN CASES OF CRIMES COMMITTED WHILE ON DUTY,
POLICE AND ARMED FORCES MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY
JURISDICTION AND TO THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE WHICH IS NOT
APPLICABLE TO CIVILIANS EXCEPT IN THE CASE DESCRIBED BY ARTICLE 235,
WHICH ESTABLISHES THE APPLICATION OF THE DEATH SENTENCE IN CASE OF
BETRAYAL OF THE MOTHERLAND DURING WAR.

   NOW, THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS DO NOT
WANT TO READ THE SECOND PART OF ARTICLE 282 WHICH STATES: THOSE WHO
AVOID COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY CODE OF
JUSTICE.  THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE ONE THAT LEGALLY AND CONSTITUTIONALLY
ALLOWS US TO TRY TERRORISTS UNDER THE MILITARY JURISDICTION, BECAUSE
TERRORISTS ALSO VIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN THEY
COMMIT CRIMES.

   MANY PERUVIANS WRONGFULLY THINK THAT THE COMPULSORY MILITARY
SERVICE ONLY AFFECTS MEN ON ACTIVE SERVICE, LIKE THOSE PERUVIANS WHO,
AFTER A SELECTION ARE SENT TO SERVE IN A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2
YEARS. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH ONE COMPLIES WITH THE
COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE.

   THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES IN ARTICLE 2: THE
COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE IN AN UNAVOIDABLE DUTY OF ALL PERUVIANS
WHO MUST PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL DEFENSE BY COMPLYING WITH THEIR
MILITARY OBLIGATIONS.  [CONTINUED]

MOREOVER, THE CONSERVATIVE INTER-AMERICAN PRESS ASSOCIATION HAS
CONDEMNED CRISTIANI BECAUSE OF THE CENSORSHIP, THE DISINFORMATION
NETWORK, AND THE PERSECUTION AGAINST LOCAL AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS AND
THE FEDERATION OF LATIN AMERICAN JOURNALISTS HAS JUST DONE THE SAME.
THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH IS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL LATIN AMERICAN
GROUP, HAS CRITICIZED CRISTIANI'S REJECTION OF A CEASE-FIRE, WHICH WAS
REQUESTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND INCLUDED BY THE FMLN IN
ITS LATEST POLITICAL PROPOSAL.  IN ADDITION, THE GROUP OF EIGHT HAS
DESCRIBED CRISTIANI'S REJECTION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS

   CRISTIANI'S SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES IS BECOMING DRAMATIC.
THE BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS THAT SUPPORTED MILITARY AID HAS BOKEN UP.
THE U.S. PRESS IS INCREASINGLY CRITICAL OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT

PERSONALITIES LIKE JESSE JACKSON ARE DEMANDING AND END TO AID FOR

TERMS, OF THE BISHOPS OF ALL U.S. CHURCHES.  THE SCENES OF THE U.S.
PERSONNEL'S DEPARTURE FROM SAN [13-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] $4

SECTORS HAD [11-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] AND MOST RECENTLY IN

STATESMANSHIP IN ITS ACTIONS AND AS A RATIONAL AND SENSIBLE POLITICAL
AND MILITARY FORCE WITH WHICH RELATIONS OF EQUALITY AND RESPECT CAN BE
ESTABLISHED TO FIND POLITICAL SOLUTIONS AND TO AVOID A REGIONALIZATION
AND DEEPENING OF THE CONFLICT.

   TO ACHIEVE DEMOCRATIZATION, TO ENFORCE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS,
THERE HAD TO BE [5-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED.
THIS IS THE FIRST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT, WHICH ADDS TO THE MANY GAINS

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 MAY 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] AT LEAST 18 CASUALTIES,
AMONG BOTH SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS, RESULTED FROM SEVERAL GUERRILLA
ATTACKS ON THE PRESIDENT'S RESIDENCE, THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL,
AND OTHER MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN SAN SALVADOR AND SEVERAL
DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) REPORTED THAT FOUR ARMY
MEMBERS, INCLUDING TWO OFFICERS, WERE KILLED AND SIX SOLDIERS WERE
WOUNDED IN CLASHES IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTHERN SAN
SALVADOR.

   THE TWO DEAD OFFICERS WERE IDENTIFIED AS CAPTAIN JOSE ALFONSO
CHAVEZ AND LIEUTENANT BOLANOS OF THE TREASURY POLICE.

   A TREASURY POLICE MEMBER WAS KILLED IN A REBEL ATTACK IN SAN
MIGUEL, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD LARGEST CITY, EARLY THIS MORNING.

   THE ATTACKS BEGAN AT 2100 (0300 GMT) ON 1 MAY AND CONTINUED AFTER
MIDNIGHT, ALARMING CITIZENS IN SAN SALVADOR AND CAUSING BLACKOUTS.

   FURTHERMORE, THE SALVADORAN RED CROSS REPORTED THAT EIGHT MINORS
WERE WOUNDED IN TWO CLASHES BETWEEN GUERRILLA FORCES AND SOLDIERS IN
ILOBASCO, CABANAS DEPARTMENT, AND USULUTAN, LOCATED IN THE SOUTHEAST
AREA OF THE COUNTRY.

   MILITARY SPOKESMEN SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA FORCES ATTACKED THE
PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE, THE SHERATON HOTEL'S SECURITY CORPS, PUBLIC
WORKS MINISTER MAURICIO STUBIG'S RESIDENCE, AND THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL
COUNCIL.

   THE COPREFA REPORTED THAT THERE WAS PROPERTY DAMAGE BUT NO
CASUALTIES IN THESE PLACES.

   MILITARY REPORTS ADDED THAT A CIVIL DEFENSE MEMBER WAS WOUNDED IN A
REBEL HARASSMENT OF THE CIVIL DEFENSE GROUP IN THE TOWN OF YUCUAYQUIN,
EASTERN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.

   ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY SOURCES, THE TOWNS OF JOCORO AND
GUADALUPE WERE ALSO ATTACKED BY THE REBELS, BUT THERE WERE NO
CASUALTIES REPORTED IN THESE ATTACKS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI
DENIED THAT THERE IS DIVISION IN THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND SAID
THE CHANGES ANNOUNCED 2 DAYS AGO WERE "ROUTINE."

   ON 31 DECEMBER, THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES PUBLISHED AN ORDER
ANNOUNCING THAT AIR FORCE GEN RAFAEL BUSTILLO, ONE OF THE MOST
INFLUENTIAL "HARDLINE" OFFICERS IN ITS COMMAND STAFF, HAD BEEN
DISCHARGED.

   BESIDES BUSTILLO, WHO WILL BE REPLACED THIS WEEK BY GEN RAFAEL
VILLAMARIONA, OTHER MINOR CHANGES AT SEVERAL MILITARY GARRISONS WERE
ANNOUNCED.

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, CRISTIANI REFUSED TO COMMENT ON GEN
BUSTILLO'S STATEMENTS, WHO THIS WEEK WARNED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES "NOT TO BE TRICKED BY GUERRILLA LEADERS" WHO WANTED TO
ATTAIN A QUOTA OF POWER THROUGH THE DIALOGUE.

   BUSTILLO, WHO BECAME CHIEF OF THE AIR FORCE AFTER A COUP D'ETAT
UNSEATED PRESIDENT CARLOS HUMBERTO ROMERO ON 15 OCTOBER 1979, ALSO
ACCUSED SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS AND AUXILIARY
BISHOP GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ OF BEING "BAD RELIGIOUS OFFICIALS" AND
PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE GUERRILLAS.

   THERE ARE COMMENTARIES CIRCULATING IN POLITICAL CIRCLES ABOUT A
"CLEAR DIVISION" AMONG HARDLINE MILITARY OFFICERS OF THE ARMED FORCES,
WHO ARE PART OF THE LA TANDONA [MEMBERS OF THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS
OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] GROUP.  THESE
OFFICER ARE AGAINST REACHING A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT AND
TALKS WITH THE REBELS.

   OBSERVERS AGREE THAT GEN BUSTILLO'S DISCHARGE WAS PROMPTED BY THE
AIR FORCE BOMBING OF LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN
SALVADOR DURING THE RECENT GENERAL OFFENSIVE BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].

   THESE STATEMENTS WERE DENIED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI WHO INSISTED
THAT BUSTILLO'S DISCHARGE WAS SIMPLY A ROUTINE MOVE WITHIN THE
MILITARY INSTITUTION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 15 OCT 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING
TO SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, THE GOVERNMENT HAS RECEIVED
REPORTS, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS DISTURBING, THAT THE REBELS ARE
PLANNING TO UNLEASH AN OFFENSIVE IN THE CAPITAL CITY ON THE VERY DAY
WHEN PEACE TALKS ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN COSTA RICA.  GOVERNMENT
REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THE INSURGENTS WILL NOT ONLY STEP UP THEIR
ACTIONS TO DESTROY THE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND MURDER GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS, BUT ALSO THREATEN TO USE GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES AGAINST
THE CITY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] ALTHOUGH THE PEACE PROCESS IS UNDER
WAY, WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] COMMAND HAS AUTHORIZED A PLAN TO STEP UP VIOLENCE IN
SAN SALVADOR THROUGH THE USE OF GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOWS ABSOLUTELY NO WILLINGNESS TO BRING ABOUT
PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. THE MEDIA SHOULD REVEAL TO ALL SALVADORANS AND
THE ENTIRE WORLD WHAT THE FMLN IS PLANNING TO DO.  [END RECORDING]

   ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT, THESE FMLN PLANS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO
THE PEACE PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO.  WHEN ASKED
WHETHER THESE ACTIONS PLANNED BY THE FMLN COULD HARM THE TALKS IN
COSTA RICA, CRISTIANI SAID THAT THIS WILL DEPEND ON THE SITUATION THAT
PREVAILS AT THE MEETING.  HE ADDED THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
OPPOSES THE USE OF THE TALKS FOR TACTICAL PURPOSES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IF THE FMLN WANTS TO USE THE PROCESS
FOR TACTICAL PURPOSES, WE WILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO THEIR GAME.  OUR
OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN TO SEEK PEACE IN GOOD WILL.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, WE
WILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO A FMLN TACTICAL GAME.  I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT WE CAN MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS AT THIS MOMENT.  THE OUTCOME WILL
DEPEND ON THESE ALLEGED PLANS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN COSTA RICA.  [END
RECORDING]

   AN END TO THE HOSTILITIES WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THIS ROUND OF TALKS.
THUS, THIS MEETING COULD BE CRUCIAL FOR ACHIEVING NATIONAL PEACE.
CRISTIANI MAINTAINED THAT THIS MEETING WILL BE USEFUL TO GAUGE THE
INTENTIONS OF THE GUERRILLA FRONT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE WILL PRESENT A GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL.
IT IS AN BROAD PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH VARIOUS ISSUES, EVEN THE
POSSIBLE INCORPORATION OF THE FMLN TO CIVILIAN AND DEMOCRATIC LIFE.
IT SPECIFICALLY DEALS WITH AN END TO THE HOSTILITIES, A TOPIC THAT WE
HAD AGREED TO ADDRESS IN COSTA RICA DURING OUR MEETING IN MEXICO.  WE
ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC THAT IS WITHIN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL
FRAMEWORK FOR THE SAKE OF DEMOCRACY.  [END RECORDING]

   THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED AS BENEFICIAL THE UN AND OAS PRESENCE AT
THE TALKS, BECAUSE THEY WILL GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS
SIGNED IN COSTA RICA.

   ONLY A DAY BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE FMLN, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT DESPITE AN INCREASE IN WAR
ACTIONS, THE MEETING IN COSTA RICA WILL NOT FACE OBSTACLES.

DR JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH AND CALLED THE ATTACK AN ATTEMPT TO
HINDER DIALOGUE.  THE PRESIDENT HAS ORDERED 3 DAYS OF NATIONAL
MOURNING IN HONOR OF THE SLAIN MINISTER.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE ARE GOING TO RESPOND LEGALLY.  WE
WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE REQUISITE EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATIONS TO FIND
AND PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR A CRIME AGAINST THE LIFE OF AN
EXEMPLARY CITIZEN. [END RECORDING]

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BLAMED THE FMLN FOR MINISTER RODRIGUEZ
PORTH'S DEATH.  HE SAID THIS ATTACK IS PART OF A SERIES OF ACTIONS
AIMED AT DESTABILIZING THE NEW GOVERNMENT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE ARE VIRTUALLY CONVINCED THAT THIS
WAS AN FMLN EFFORT, AN FMLN INCIDENT, TO TRY AND PROVOKE A REACTION
FROM OUR GOVERNMENT.  WE FEEL THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
SHOW US WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT; HOWEVER, I
REPEAT WE ARE ALMOST SURE THAT THIS WAS DONE BY THE FMLN.

   WE HAD HOPED THE FMLN WOULD REFRAIN FROM THIS TYPE OF BARBARIC
ACTION; HOWEVER, IT IS THE DUTY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SECURITY
CORPS TO OFFER PROTECTION.  THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED: TO
OFFER GREATER SAFETY AND PROTECTION TO THE PEOPLE. [END RECORDING]

   DURING THIS EVENING'S RADIO VENCEREMOS NEWSCAST, HOWEVER, THE
REBELS NEITHER CLAIMED NOR DENIED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.
NEVERTHELESS, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THE ASSASSINATION MAY HAVE BEEN
CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN IN AN ATTEMPT TO HINDER THE DIALOGUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE HAD LEARNED, EVEN BEFORE THE
INAUGURATION, THAT THE FMLN WOULD TRY TO HINDER THE TRANSITION FROM
ONE GOVERNMENT TO ANOTHER AND LATER CREATE ANARCHIC SITUATIONS FOR THE
NEW GOVERNMENT. THIS COULD BE PART OF THAT PLAN.

   I ALSO FEEL THAT THIS COULD BE THE FMLN'S WAY TO FORCE US TO SIT
DOWN AND TALK.  IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE THAT AFTER RECEIVING A FORMAL
OFFER TO SIT DOWN TO TALK -- FIRST ABOUT THE MECHANISMS TO BE USED AS
GUIDELINES DURING THE TALKS AND LATER TO BROACH THE MAIN ISSUES IN AN
ATTEMPT TO REACH A LASTING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY -- THE FMLN SHOULD
STILL THINK THAT SUCH ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY.  I THINK THEY ARE ONLY
TRYING TO DISRUPT THE NEW GOVERNMENT'S WORK. [END RECORDING]

   DURING THIS EVENING'S NEWS CONFERENCE, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID
THAT DURING TODAY'S CABINET MEETING IT WAS DECIDED TO ASK THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO DECREE 3 DAYS OF MOURNING FOR DR RODRIGUEZ
PORTH.

   BOGOTA, 27 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [SPEECH] [CESAR
GAVIRIA TRUJILLO, LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENT-ELECT] [TEXT] THIS IS A
NIGHT OF HAPPINESS FOR ALL OF MY FAMILY, FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO WITH
THEIR DEDICATION AND THEIR WORK HAVE ACCOMPANIED ME IN THIS DIFFICULT
MOMENT OF COLOMBIAN LIFE.  I HAVE, DEEP IN MY THOUGHTS, MY CAMPAIGN
COMPANIONS, MY DEBATE LEADERS, ALL THOSE WHO FILLED EVERY MOMENT WITH
DEDICATION AND ENTHUSIASM, WHICH I HOPE TO DESERVE.  I HAVE PRESENT
THE UNIVERSITY YOUTH, STAUNCH STANDARD-BEARERS OF THE CONSTITUENT
ASSEMBLY [APPLAUSE]; ALL OF MY PARTY LEADERS, SERVANTS OF THE LIBERAL
CAUSE WHO SHOWED STEADFAST LOYALTY; GRASSROOTS LEADERS FROM ALL PARTS
OF COLOMBIA; AND THE PEOPLE, WHOSE DECISION COMMITS ME BEYOND ANY
DOUBT.

   I WANT TO OFFER THIS VICTORY TO GLORIA, JUAN MANUEL, AND HIS
BROTHERS [APPLAUSE], AND TO LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S PARENTS -- MARIO AND
CECILIA -- WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM IN HIS LONG HEROIC JOURNEY THROUGH
COLOMBIAN LIFE.  THIS IS HIS VICTORY, A VICTORY FOR HIS CHILDREN, HIS
IDEALS, HIS FAITH IN COLOMBIA, AND THE LIBERAL PRINCIPLES THAT
INSPIRED HIS LIFE.

   I ALSO THINK OF MY MOTHER; MY BROTHERS; ANA MILENA [APPLAUSE], MY
WIFE AND COMPANION AT ALL TIMES AND DURING SLEEPLESS NIGHTS; AND MY
CHILDREN SIMON AND MARIA PAZ.  [APPLAUSE]

   TODAY COLOMBIA HAS COMPLETED THE MOST DIFFICULT AND RUGGED
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN ALL ITS HISTORY.  ITS VALUES, ITS DEMOCRACY, AND
ITS LIBERTY WERE AT STAKE AS NEVER BEFORE.  AS NEVER BEFORE, THE
PROMOTERS OF VIOLENCE FROM ALL SIDES TRIED TO DESTABILIZE OUR
INSTITUTIONS.  HOWEVER, COLOMBIANS, ALSO AS NEVER BEFORE, STOOD UP TO
THE HISTORIC MOMENT WE FACED.  THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE'S POWERFUL
DEMOCRATIC DETERMINATION WAS STRONGER.  CONVINCED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF
THE CURRENT HOUR, THEY WENT OUT TO SUPPORT WITH MILLIONS OF VOTES
DEMOCRACY THAT HAS HAD TO FACE BOMBS, NARCOTERRORISM, AND HATEFUL
PRACTICES.

   ALL THOSE WHO HAVE WANTED TO THREATEN OUR DEMOCRACY MUST LISTEN:
OUR PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN TODAY WITH COURAGE AND CLARITY.  WE SHALL
PREVAIL.  IT HAS BEEN A CONSCIENTIOUS, BOLD MOBILIZATION BY MILLIONS
OF COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR POLITICAL WILL FOR THE FIRST
TIME THROUGH A SYSTEM WITHOUT PRESSURE OR INTIMIDATION.  ONCE AGAIN,
TODAY, AS ON 11 MARCH, CITIZENS VOTED AS THEY WISHED.

   THIS DIFFICULT AND RUGGED CAMPAIGN HAS NOT BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY A
CRUDE CONFRONTATION AMONG CANDIDATES, WHO ACTED WITH DECENCY AND
LOYALTY.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 25 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA ALIAS
"THE MEXICAN," A WELL-KNOWN COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER WHO IS ONE OF
THE DRUG LORDS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAS ADMITTED THAT HE IS IN FAVOR
OF "CEASING OFFENSIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE MILITARY FORCES."

   IN A LETTER TO THE OPPOSITION'S DAILY LA PRENSA EDITED IN BOGOTA,
HE STRESSED THAT "THE MISSION EACH ONE OF US HAS AS COLOMBIAN CITIZENS
IS TRYING TO RESTORE PEACE IN COLOMBIA."

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA, WHO ALONG WITH PABLO ESCOBAR HAVE BECOME THE
COUNTRY'S MOST WANTED MEN, DENIED HAVING PROPOSED AN ALLIANCE WITH THE
COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA
(FARC).

   ONLY 1 WEEK AGO, LA PRENSA REPORTED THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA HAD
PROPOSED AN ALLIANCE WITH THE FARC IN ORDER TO FACE THE WAR AGAINST
DRUG TRAFFICKING DECLARED BY LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IN
MID-AUGUST.

   "THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH LETTER," SAID THE "CAPO" FOR
WHOSE HEAD -- ALONG WITH PABLO ESCOBAR -- COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE
OFFERED A REWARD OF 100 MILLION PESOS (APPROXIMATELY $250,000).

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA ALSO RECALLED HIS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FARC.

   TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OCCASION, THE DRUG TRAFFICKER REJECTED ALL
INFORMATION THAT STATING THAT HE IS THE "ACKNOWLEDGED PERPETRATOR OF
ALL CRIMES AGAINST PATRIOTIC UNION LEADERS (UP)."  HE ADDED THAT
ALTHOUGH HE WAS CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF JAIME PARDO LEAL "THE
COURT'S VERDICT WAS FAVORABLE TO ME."

   PARDO LEAL WAS THE FOUNDER AND FIRST PRESIDENT OF UP.  UP WAS
FORMED IN 1984, DURING A TRUCE SIGNED BETWEEN FARC AND THE THEN SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENT BELISARIO BETANCUR.  ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS, PARDO LEAL WAS MURDERED BY TWO PAID ASSASSINS WHO RECEIVED
ORDERS FROM "EL MEXICANO" ON 11 OCTOBER 1987.

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA ARGUED: "NOBODY HAS BEEN CHASED WITH SUCH
FIERCENESS IN COLOMBIA BEFORE AS I HAVE."  HE ADDED: "IT SEEMS THAT
ALL THE ARTICLES OF THE PENAL CODE HAVE BEEN THROWN AT ME AND MY
DETRACTORS ARE NOT BINDED BY ANY OF THESE NORMS."

   AFTER HE INSISTED THAT OFFENSIVES AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN ARMED
FORCES SHOULD STOP, RODRIGUEZ GACHA NOTED THAT THOSE WHO DISTURB
PUBLIC ORDER "SHOULD DEFINITELY STOP USING WEAPONS."

   "THESE ARE THE FIRST STEPS THAT ARE NEEDED TO GET COLOMBIANS TO SIT
AT A NEGOTIATING TABLE WITHOUT EXCLUDING ANYONE," HE CONCLUDED.

   VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT HAS REJECTED ALL POSSIBILITY OF
DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG MAFIAS.

   BOGOTA, 1 FEB 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION
(ELN) HAS ANNOUNCED IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR,
GOVERNOR OF THE NORTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, THAT IT REJECTS THE
PEACE PLAN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT IT WILL CONTINUE ARMED
ATTACKS, IT WAS LEARNED A FEW HOURS AGO.

   ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, THE ARMED MOVEMENT--THE MOST RADICAL
OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY--SENT THE MESSAGE THROUGH LUIS
MESA PUERTA, A POLICE INSPECTOR OF EL TIGRE, WHO WAS KIDNAPED LAST
FRIDAY FOR THIS PURPOSE.

   ROLDAN BETANCUR DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY MORE DETAILS AND MERELY
CONFIRMED THAT THE CASTROITE ELN, WHICH HAS STAGED SEVERAL DYNAMITE
ATTACKS AGAINST OIL INSTALLATIONS, DID NOT ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL MADE BY
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS' GOVERNMENT.

   MEANWHILE, THE M-19 SENT A LETTER A FEW HOURS AGO TO MISAEL
PASTRANA BORRERO, A FORMER PRESIDENT AND MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION
SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY (PSC), REQUESTING THAT HIS PARTY ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATE IN A NEW PEACE INITIATIVE THAT FORMALLY BEGAN THE 2D WEEK
OF JANUARY.

   AT THAT TIME, ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA--THE
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR PEACE--AND THE TOP M-19 COMMANDER, CARLOS
PIZARRO LEON GOMEZ, SIGNED A PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT THAT CONTEMPLATES
THE BEGINNING OF A DIRECT DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLA GROUPS AND
SPOKESMEN OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT.

   HOWEVER, THE FARC, WHICH DECLARED A UNILATERAL TRUCE TO FACILIATE
THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATIONS, SAID THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WERE
"EXCLUSIVE," AS THEY WERE SIGNED BY ONLY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S REBEL
MOVEMENTS.

   THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 SPECIFIES THAT
THE TASKS WITH ALL THE REBEL ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE
SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNGSB).  HOWEVER,
WITH THE ELN ANNOUNCEMENT, A JOINT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RULED OUT.

   MEANWHILE, PRIOR TO LEAVING TODAY FOR CARACAS WHERE HE WILL ATTEND
THE INAUGURATION OF CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, THE PRESIDENT HELD A MEETING
WITH THE CHIEFS OF THE TWO TRADITIONAL PARTIES, FORMER PRESIDENTS
JULIO CESAR TURBAY OF THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, AND PASTRANA BORRERO,
OF THE PSC.

   THE MEETING HELD AT THE NARINO PALACE (SEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT) WAS
CALLED SO THAT BARCO VARGAS COULD REPORT TO THE PSC ON THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE MOST RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE NEW PEACE PROCESS THAT BEGAN
WITH THE M-19.

   ACCORDING TO SOME POLITICAL CIRCLES, IN THIS MANNER THE PATH TOWARD
PEACE MIGHT BE CLEARED, INASMUCH AS ONE OF THE "RESERVATIONS" THE PSC
HAD WAS THAT THE BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT DID NOT CONSULT WITH THE
PARTIES ON THE NEGOTIATIONS.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 14 MAR 90 (EL SIGLO) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] AS
FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INVESTIGATE, U.S.  SOUTHERN COMMAND TROOPS
IN PANAMA ARE GUARDING THE VERACRUZ AREA TO PREVENT CRIMINALS FROM
LEAVING.  BY DOING THIS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ARREST AT ANY TIME THE
FOLLOWERS OF GENERAL NORIEGA, CURRENTLY UNDER ARREST IN FLORIDA ON
DRUG TRAFFICKING CHARGES.

   A CITIZEN BY THE NAME OF CUETO, WHO IS FRIGHTENED BY THE CRIME IN
VERACRUZ, SAID THAT "ONE OF THESE DRUG DEALERS DISTRIBUTED A LEAFLET
ON THE NIGHT OF 11 MARCH THAT WARNED THE POPULATION THAT ANYONE WHO
REPORTS THE MEMBERS OF THE PRO-NORIEGA BAND, LIVING IN VERACRUZ, TO
THE AUTHORITIES WILL DIE IMMEDIATELY WITH THEIR TONGUES HANGING LIKE A
TIE.  THE LEAFLET ADDS THAT IN A FEW DAYS THE BAND WILL PLACE BOMBS
NEAR HOWARD AIR FORCE BASE TO AVENGE THE ARREST OF THEIR CRONIES IN
THE CURUNDU NEIGHBORHOOD."

   FINALLY, EL SIGLO HAS LEARNED THAT THE CRIMINALS AND DRUG DEALERS
WHO HAVE INVADED VERACRUZ HAVE SMALL CANOES AND SMALL MOTOR BOATS WITH
WHICH THEY TRAVEL TO THE CAPITAL POSING AS FISHERMEN.  IN THESE SMALL
BOATS, THEY TRANSPORT THE DRUGS THAT THEY WILL SELL DURING THE WEEK IN
PANAMA CITY; THIS DRUGS ARE STORED IN DIFFERENT HOUSES IN VERACRUZ.

   IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MOST OF THESE CRIMINALS BELONG TO THE
CODEPADI [COMMITTEE FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE FATHERLAND AND DIGNITY] AND
THE DIGNITY BATTALIONS, AND AS FAR AS WE COULD DETERMINE, THEY ARE
STILL RECEIVING SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE WHO THRIVED DURING THE PREVIOUS
GOVERNMENT AND WHO ARE CONTINUING TO STRUGGLE FOR NORIEGA'S RETURN.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] IN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT THERE ARE ALSO CRIMINALS LIKE VICE PRESIDENT MERINO, A MAN
WHO HAS PERSONALLY PARTICIPATED IN CRIMES AGAINST THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, AGAINST THE SALVADORAN [WORD INDISTINCT].  THERE IS ALSO
D'AUBUISSON, WHO IS ANOTHER ASSASSIN WHO HAS PARTICIPATED IN CRIMES
AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   NICARAGUA IS GOING TO DEMAND PUNISHMENT FOR THE ASSASSINS OF
PRIESTS AND OF SALVADORAN PEOPLE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  IT
WILL DEMAND THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BREAK RELATIONS WITH EL
SALVADOR AND THAT IT TAKE MEASURES AGAINST THAT CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT
UNTIL IT STOPS THE BOMBINGS AND THE CRIMES AND IT PUNISHES THE
CRIMINALS.

   WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN IS PEACE AND DEMOCRACY, BUT NOT THE PEACE
OF GRAVEYARDS.  THERE IS PEACE IN CEMETERIES [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THAT
IS THE PEACE THEY WANT FOR EL SALVADOR, THE PEACE OF GRAVEYARDS.  THEY
WANT TO TURN EL SALVADOR INTO A CEMETERY.  IN OTHER WORDS, [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE COURAGEOUS.  THEY ARE
HEROIC PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT.  THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWING THIS.
THEY HAVE GREAT [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE STRUGGLING IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE TO
ACHIEVE PEACE.  IT IS NOT WE NICARAGUANS, IT IS NOT I BREAKING THE
ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS.  I WILL CONTINUE TO DEFEND THEM SO THAT THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL ABIDE BY THEM, BECAUSE HUMAN RIGHTS MUST BE
RESPECTED.  ON 7 AUGUST 1987, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SIGNED AN
AGREEMENT SAYING THAT IT WAS GOING TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, AND IT IS
NOT ABIDING BY THAT AGREEMENT.  IT HAS TO COMPLY WITH THAT AGREEMENT
EVEN IF IT WITHDRAWS FROM THE PEACE TALKS, EVEN IF IT DOES NOT WANT TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETINGS OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.

   WE ARE ALSO GOING TO CONTINUE STRUGGLING IN THE INTERNATIONAL
SPHERE, IN THE UNITED NATIONS, SO THAT AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED TO
COMPLY WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE CONTRAS FROM HONDURAS.  IF THE CONTRAS
DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE HONDURAS, WELL, WHAT HAS BEEN SHOWN ON THIS
BORDER, IN THESE HEROIC TOWNS OF [NAME INDISTINCT], VILLANUEVA,
SOMOTILLO, [NAME INDISTINCT], SAN PEDRO, SAN BENITO, SAN FRANCISCO,
AND SANTO TOMAS?  ALL THOSE NAMES ARE KNOWN IN THE WORLD FOR THE
HEROIC BATTLES WHICH HAVE BEEN WAGED THERE TO REJECT THE
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES WHO HAVE RECEIVED ALL TYPES OF SUPPORT FROM THE
YANKEES.  THE YANKEES HAVE GIVEN THE CONTRAS ALL TYPES OF ARMAMENTS,
INCLUDING MORE THAN 300 SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES.

   WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE PEACE BECAUSE THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WANT
PEACE. THE TOWNS IN NORTHERN NICARAGUA WANT PEACE.  THEY WANT PEACE.
DO YOU WANT PEACE? [CROWD SHOUTS: "YES!"] OR DO YOU WANT WAR?  [CROWD
SHOUTS: "NO!"] DO YOU WANT PEACE? [CROWD SHOUTS: "YES!"]  [QUESTION
AND ANSWER REPEATED TWO MORE TIMES] WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  WE
ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE TOTAL PEACE BY ALWAYS VIGOROUSLY FIGHTING THE
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES AND DEFEATING THE YANKEES IN THE ELECTIONS ON
25 FEBRUARY 1990.  [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO THROW SHOVELFULS OF DIRT
AT THE CONTRAS AND THE YANKEES ON 25 FEBRUARY 1990, BECAUSE THE
YANKEES HAVE CREATED WHAT IS CALLED THE UNO.  IT IS A MIXTURE OF
PEOPLE WHO ARE [WORDS INDISTINCT].  IT IS A SALAD BUT WITH ROTTEN
FRUIT.  [APPLAUSE, LAUGHTER] IT IS A SALAD WITH ROTTEN FRUIT.  WHO CAN
EAT A SALAD WITH ROTTEN FRUIT?  CAN YOU BE DECEIVED [WORDS
INDISTINCT]?  THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SHOW ON 25 FEBRUARY
THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE AND DEMOCRACY AND THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE PLANS
OF THE REVOLUTION.  THESE ARE GOING TO BE ELECTIONS BETWEEN NICARAGUA
AND THE YANKEES.  THE CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO BE BUSH ON THE ONE SIDE
AND DANIEL ON THE OTHER.  THOSE ARE THE CANDIDATES.  WHO ARE THE
PEOPLE GOING TO VOTE FOR? [INDISTINCT SHOUTS] ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE
FOR BUSH? [CROWD SHOUTS: "NO!"]  THOSE OTHER ONES, THE ONES GOING
AROUND THERE, THEY DO NOT REPRESENT ANYTHING.  BUSH IS PAYING THOSE
PEOPLE TO BE PRETENDING [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE REAL ENEMY HERE IS
THE YANKEES WHO HAVE ORGANIZED AND FINANCED THE UNO.  THE YANKEES
CANNOT SOLVE THE NICARAGUAN PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THEY CANNOT EVEN SOLVE
HONDURAS' PROBLEM.  THEY CANNOT SOLVE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEM, EVEN
THOUGH THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS LENT ITSELF FOR THE YANKEE
MANEUVERING.  I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE HONDURAN PEOPLE.  YOU KNOW
THAT THE HONDURAN PEOPLE ARE COMBATIVE AND BRAVE.  WHAT IS THE ARMY
USED FOR IN HONDURAS?  WHAT IS IT USED FOR?  TO MASSACRE THE PEOPLE
[PASSAGE INDISTINCT].  THE CONTRAS ARE IN HONDURAN TERRITORY.  WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING THOSE CONTRAS OUT?  IT IS UP TO THE HONDURANS,
IT IS UP TO THE HONDURAN ARMY.  [CONTINUED]

   ROME (ITALY), 28 APR 89 (ANSA) -- [TEXT] THE ROME FOREIGN MINISTRY
ON FRIDAY CONFIRMED THAT TWO ITALIAN ENGINEERS AND A SPANISH
TECHNICIAN WERE KIDNAPPED THURSDAY IN COLOMBIA FROM A CONSTRUCTION
SITE SOME THIRTY KILOMETERS FROM THE CITY OF MEDELLIN.

   THE TWO ITALIANS, ROBERTO ROASCIO OF MILAN AND MARIO ACCURSO OF
ROME, TOGETHER WITH SPANIARD FRANCISCO PUJA, WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE FROM
THE WORK SITE WHERE THE MILANESE FIRM "TORNO" IS COLLABORATING IN THE
CONSTRUCTION OF A HYDRO-ELECTRIC PLANT BEING FINANCED BY THE WORLD
BANK.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTRY ADDED THAT IT WAS IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH
ROME'S AMBASSADOR TO BOGOTA', FILIPPO ANFUSO, AND THAT THE EMBASSY'S
STAFF WAS WORKING WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ASCERTAIN THE DYNAMICS OF
THE KIDNAPPING AND WHO MAY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE.

   THE FAMILIES OF THE ITALIAN ENGINEERS, IT WAS LEARNED HERE, HAVE
BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.

[FRELIMO CENTRAL COMMITTEE] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE FRELIMO PARTY
APPRECIATES AND SUPPORTS EFFORTS MOUNTED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT
AND OTHER STATES OF CENTRAL AMERICA TO RESTORE PEACE, AND CALLS ON ALL
THE INTERESTED FORCES TO CREATE CONDITIONS TO APPLY THE PEACE PLAN AS
AGREED UPON.  WE VALUE OUR RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION
WITH THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT.

   IN THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA, THE PEOPLE'S POWER HAS CONSOLIDATED AND
THE REVOLUTION CAN NOW FUNDAMENTALLY CONCENTRATE ITS EFFORTS ON THE
TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE
IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PEOPLE.  THE [FRELIMO] PARTY
SALUTES THE RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR
PARTIES, STATES, AND PEOPLES, AND EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THESE
RELATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP FURTHER.  THE [FRELIMO] PARTY HOPES
THAT THE WINDS OF PEACE NOW BLOWING WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ELIMINATING THE
HOTBEDS OF TENSION THROUGHOUT ALL OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND LATIN AMERICA
IN GENERAL SO THAT THE PEOPLE OF THAT ZONE MAY BENEFIT FROM PEACE AND
TRANQUILITY TO UNDERTAKE THE NECESSARY FIGHT AGAINST MISERY AND
BACKWARDNESS.

   IN EUROPE, DURING THE PERIOD UNDER EXAMINATION, THE RELATIONS OF
FRIENDSHIP AND SOLIDARITY WITH OUR PEOPLE WERE DEEPENED, WHILE THE
COOPERATION OF THE MOZAMBICAN STATE WITH THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WAS
BROADENED.  IN GENERAL TERMS, WE HAVE BEEN CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE
PROCESS TO ESTABLISH THE EUROPE OF 12 AND THE TRANSFORMATIONS BEGUN IN
VARIOUS SOCIALIST COUNTRIES.

   THE [FRELIMO] PARTY VIEWS POSITIVELY THE CONTINUATION OF THE
PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATION OF THE EUROPE OF 12 AND HOPES THAT THIS
PROCESS WILL POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO BALANCED RELATIONS BETWEEN NORTH
AND SOUTH.

   THE [FRELIMO] PARTY SALUTES THE COURAGE DEMONSTRATED BY THE CPSU
LEADERSHIP, PARTICULARLY COMRADE MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, BY FACING THE
GREAT CHALLENGE OF CRITICAL REFLECTION AND FOR THE RECTIFICATIONS NOW
IN PROGRESS IN THE USSR.

   THE TRANSFORMATIONS TAKING PLACE IN VARIOUS SOCIALIST COUNTRIES
OPEN AN ENCOURAGING AND PROFITABLE THEORETICAL DEBATE ON THE
CONSTRUCTION OF SOCIALISM THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CONTINUE IN A
CLIMATE OF UNITY AND SOLIDARITY.  THE [FRELIMO] PARTY IS FOLLOWING
THIS PERIOD OF REFLECTION ON THE PROCESS OF THE BUILDING OF SOCIALISM
IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND IT IS OVERJOYED BY THE FACT THAT THIS
PROCESS CONTINUES TO SAFEGUARD COOPERATION WITH OUR COUNTRY.  WE ARE
AWARE THAT THESE CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES,
PARTICULARLY THE CHANGES THAT ARE OBSERVED IN THE USSR WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF PERESTROYKA AND GLASNOST, HAVE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT AT THE
LEVEL OF THE [MARXIST-LENINIST] PARTIES AND THE PROGRESSIVE FORCES,
AS WELL AS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN GENERAL.
THIS IMPACT HAS BEEN VERY POSITIVE AND HAS DECISIVELY CONTRIBUTED TO
CREATE A NEW ATMOSPHERE IN RELATIONS AMONG THE SUPERPOWERS AND IN THE
PROCESS OF DETENTE THAT CURRENTLY CHARACTERIZES THE INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS. [CONTINUED]

   NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), 20 OCT 89 -- [SPEECH] [CRISTIANI] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] AND WHAT DO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS MEAN WITH THAT
VERY CATEGORICAL PASSAGE?  THEY WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS THE FMLN THAT
MUST STOP ITS HOSTILITIES, AND DO SO AT ONCE, IMMEDIATELY, AND
EFFECTIVELY IN ORDER TO HOLD A DIALOGUE.  WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THE
PRESIDENTS, AS ANY RATIONAL PEOPLE, FEEL IT IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO
CONDUCT A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE WITHOUT BOMBS AND BULLETS.  WHAT ELSE
DOES THE AGREEMENT SAY?  IT SAYS THE END OF HOSTILITIES WILL PERMIT A
DIALOGUE SO THAT THE FMLN WILL LATER ABANDON THE ARMED STRUGGLE,
DISBAND AS AN ARMED GROUP, SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS, AND JOIN DEMOCRATIC
AND INSTITUTIONAL LIFE.

   BY THIS, THEY -- EVEN NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA WHO SIGNED
THE AGREEMENT -- MEAN THERE IS INSTITUTIONAL LIFE IN EL SALVADOR AND
DEMOCRACY, WHICH THEY ARE ASKING THE FMLN TO JOIN.  THIS IS THE SPIRIT
OF THE PROPOSAL THE GOVERNMENT TOOK TO SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA. BECAUSE
THE PROPOSAL WE ADOPTED IS SO LONG, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO
READ IT TO YOU, SO THAT YOU CAN BE INFORMED.

   HOWEVER, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELVES TOMORROW WHAT I AM
SAYING TO YOU TONIGHT, BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL WILL BE PUBLISHED IN ALL
OF OUR COUNTRY'S NEWSPAPERS.  THERE, YOU WILL SEE THAT THE GOVERNMENT
IS FAITHFULLY COMPLYING WITH WHAT THE FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
SIGNED IN THE TELA ACCORD, AND THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING UP ON THE TERMS
OF THE FIRST DIALOGUE IN MEXICO.

   WHAT DOES THE FMLN DO IN SAN JOSE?  FIRST, DRAWING AWAY FROM THE
AGREEMENT MADE IN MEXICO, IT DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT CEASING
HOSTILITIES.  IT INTRODUCES SEVERAL PROPOSALS, WHICH THE FMLN CLAIMS
ARE AN EXPANSION ON THE MEXICO PROPOSAL, AND PRESENTS SEVERAL
DOCUMENTS TO THE SALVADORAN DELEGATION.  BY THE WAY, THE FMLN ALSO
VIOLATES THE MEXICO PACT BY NOT RESPECTING THE DISCRETION OF THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS.  ONCE AGAIN IT PRESENTS THESE DOCUMENTS TO THE NEWS
MEDIA BEFORE PRESENTING THEM TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION.
AS YOU WILL SEE, THE DELEGATION RECEIVED QUITE A FEW DOCUMENTS FROM
THE FMLN THERE.  [CONTINUED]

OF THE SPANISH JESUITS MURDERED LAST FRIDAY [17 NOVEMBER] BY UNIFORMED
INDIVIDUALS WERE BURIED IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT
HAS ASKED THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FOR EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING THESE
DEATHS.  TODAY IN PARIS THE SPANISH PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT FUTURE
CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT LED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI DEPENDS ON THE
RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST FOR AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GONZALEZ] THE GREATEST POSSIBLE EFFORT SHOULD BE
MADE IMMEDIATELY TO INVESTIGATE WHAT HAPPENED REGARDING MURDERS WHICH
SOME PEOPLE ARE APPARENTLY INTERPRETING IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT
THEY ARE SPANISH, OR SPANISH CITIZENS WHO TOOK ON SALVADORAN
CITIZENSHIP, BUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THE CITIZENS WHO
SUFFERED THIS APPALLING ATTACK, THIS MURDER, WERE SPANISH.  OUR
CONCERN OBVIOUSLY IS NOT EXPRESSED MERELY IN TERMS OF THIS OR THAT
NATIONALITY BECAUSE THIS MURDER IS A HIDEOUS CRIME AND THUS THE MATTER
MUST BE CLEARED UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND FURTHERMORE MUCH OF THE
EFFORT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF [WORDS INDISTINCT] WITH REGARD
TO THAT COUNTRY DEPENDS UPON IT.  [END RECORDING]

   A SPANISH DIPLOMATIC DELEGATION HEADED BY UNDERSECRETARY FOR
FOREIGN AFFAIRS INOCENCIO ARIAS ATTENDED THE BURIAL OF THE JESUITS.
HE PUT HIMSELF AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE SPANISH RESIDENTS IN EL SALVADOR
WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND RETURN TO SPAIN.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 10 JAN 90 (RADIO REBELDE NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] DESPITE AMPLE EVIDENCE, NO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAD BLAMED THE
ARMED FORCES OF KILLING DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR
WORSENED IN 1979.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT MADE BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI OF THE ARREST OF 45 SOLDIERS AND 2 OFFICERS FOR KILLING 6
CLERGYMEN, A MAID, AND HER DAUGHTER, ON 16 NOVEMBER IS IN ITSELF A
SMALL AND PARTIAL MILESTONE.

   CRISTIANI, WHOSE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE PARTY WAS FOUNDED
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTIES BY INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO PARAMILITARY
BANDS, THE ARMY, AND SECURITY CORPS, ASSERTED THAT THE NAMES OF THOSE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES WILL BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

   JESUIST FRANCISCO ESTRADA, WHO REPLACED FATHER JOSE IGNACIO
ELLACURIA -- ONE OF THOSE MASSACRED -- AT THE RECTORSHIP OF THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN SAN SALVADOR, WARNED THAT IT IS NOT
ENOUGH TO KNOW WHICH SARGENT PULLED THE TRIGGER BUT WHO GAVE HIM
ORDERS TO DO SO NEEDS TO BE REVEALED.  CRISTIANI WILL NOT GO THAT FAR.

   COSMETIC SACRIFICES ARE MADE IN ORDER TO NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT OF
U.S. CONGRESS INTERRUPTING THE $1.5 MILLION IT SENDS A DAY FOR THE WAR
AGAINST THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] AND THE
REPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE.

   THE DISMISSAL OF GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLO AS CHIEF OF THE AIR
FORCES AND THE POSSIBLE PUNISHMENT OF SOME OF THE COUNTERINSURGENT
ATLACATL BATTALION FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS.  HOWEVER, CRISTIANI
WILL ATTEND THE NEXT INFORMAL SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN
TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS ON 28 JANUARY UNDER ADVERSE CONDITIONS.

   THE MOBILIZATION OF THE LATIN AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST THE
U.S. INTERVENTION IN PANAMA AND ITS AIM OF EXTENDING THE INTERVENTION
TO OTHER NATIONS OF THE AREA HAVE WEAKENED WASHINGTON'S DIPLOMATIC
SPACE. THIS COULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON ITS POLITICAL ALLY OF EL SALVADOR
WHICH, IN THE PREVIOUS SUMMIT HELD IN DECEMBER, PRESENTED NICARAGUA
AND THE FMLN AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORSENING OF THE CRISIS IN CENTRAL
AMERICA.

   THE FACTS ARE CONCLUSIVE. WHAT WILL NOW BE THE EXCUSE OF SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS PROTECTOR GEORGE BUSH?

WITH ARMY FUNDS.  THE GROUP ALSO SOUGHT TO DISSOLVE THE ARMED FORCES.

   ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS THAT WERE SEIZED FROM THE TERRORISTS BY
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, THE ATTACKERS PLANNED TO ISSUE A PROCLAMATION.
THE PROCLAMATION STATES THAT THE SO-CALLED "PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT,"
ALLEGEDLY TO HAVE BEEN INSTALLED BY THEM, WOULD ADOPT THE FOLLOWING
MEASURES:

   1. TO DECREE A 150-PERCENT SALARY INCREASE FOR ALL PEOPLE EARNING
2,000 AUSTRALES OR LESS;

   2. TO DECREE A 100-PERCENT SALARY INCREASE FOR ALL PEOPLE EARNING
3,000 AUSTRALES;

   3. TO DECREE A 40-PERCENT SALARY INCREASE FOR PEOPLE WHO EARN UP TO
6,000 AUSTRALES;

   4. TO INCREASE MINIMUM PENSIONS TO 4,000 AUSTRALES;

   5. TO ELIMINATE ALL PRIVILEGED PENSIONS FOR THE MILITARY, DEPUTIES,
SENATORS, COUNCILMEN, CABINET MEMBERS, AND SECRETARIES OF STATE;

   6. TO DECREE A PRICE FREEZE AND TO DECREE THAT ALL THOSE WHO
VIOLATE THE ESTABLISHED PRICE FREEZE, AS WELL AS SPECULATORS AND
HOARDERS, WILL BE PUNISHED WITH SENTENCES OF UP TO 20 YEARS; IT WIL BE
UP TO THE PEOPLE TO CONTROL THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PRICE FREEZE;

   7. TO DECREE THE IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION OF EVICTIONS AND DECREE A
FREEZE ON HOUSE RENTS;

   8. TO DECREASE INTEREST RATES AND NEGATIVE RATES, EVEN ON
PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED CREDITS;

   9. TO CANCEL IMMEDIATELY DEBTS CONTRACTED WITH THE FINANCIAL
MARKET;

   10. TO CANCEL DEBTS CONTRACTED BY SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED FARMERS
WITH THE BANKING SECTOR;

   11. TO IMPLEMENT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE OF 2,000 AUSTRALES PER
CHILD;

   12. TO IMPLEMENT A SUBSIDY FOR UNWED MOTHERS OF 3,000 AUSTRALES;

   13. THE PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT HEREBY NATIONALIZES THE BANKING SECTOR;
THE IAPI, ARGENTINE INSTITUTE FOR PROMOTION OF FOREIGN TRADE,
[INSTITUTO ARGENTINO DE PROMOCION DEL INTERCAMBIO] IS REESTABLISHED;

   14. ARTICLE NO 40 OF THE 1949 CONSTITUTION IS HEREBY ESTABLISHED:
"ENERGY SOURCES ARE THE INALIENABLE PROPERTY OF THE NATION."

   THE REST OF THE TERRORIST PROCLAMATION STATES:

   THIS IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND SOLIDARITY PLAN THAT WILL BE
IMPLEMENTED FOR 120 DAYS.  IT SEEKS TO PROMOTE INVESTMENTS FOR
PRODUCTION, AND CONSUMPTION.  WITHIN THIS 120-DAY PERIOD, THE PROPER
NATIONAL SECTORS WILL HELP IN THE DRAFTING OF A SHORT-, MEDIUM-, AND
LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PLAN THAT WILL PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE ENTIRE
COMMUNITY.

   THE FUNDS TO FINANCE THIS NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND SOLIDARITY PLAN
WILL DERIVE FROM:

   1. THE ELIMINATION OF THE MILITARY BUDGET, SINCE THE ARMY HAS BEEN
REPLACED BY THE POPULAR MILITIAS OF THE PEOPLE'S RESISTANCE FRONT;

   2. THE EXPRESSION OF ALL THE PROPERTIES OF JOSE ALFREDO MARTINEZ DE
HOZ AND OF ALL MILITARY OFFICERS WHO HAVE MORE THAN ONE HOUSE AND ONE
CAR; THE SAME WILL APPLY TO ALL UNION LEADERS;

   3. THE EXPROPRIATION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET; 

   4. THE SUSPENSION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE FOREIGN DEBT.

   THIS PLAN IS BASED ON THE SOLIDARITY OF MILLIONS OF ARGENTINES, THE
IMMENSE MAJORITY OF WORKERS, PRODUCERS, AND UNEMPLOYED.  WE HAVE THE
ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO LIVE IN A FATHERLAND WITH LIBERTY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE,
WHERE ALL MEN ARE BROTHERS, AND WHERE THE WEALTH OF THE COUNTRY MAY BE
ENJOYED BY EVERYONE IN KEEPING WITH HIS WORK, HIS CREATIVITY, AND HIS
HONESTY.

   LA PAZ, 25 MAY 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] TWO U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES --
AGED 19 AND 21 -- WERE SHOT TO DEATH LAST NIGHT BY A GROUP OF
TERRORISTS FROM THE ZARATE WILKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION [FAL].

   THIS IS THE SAME TERRORIST GROUP THAT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE FOILED
ATTACK AGAINST FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ IN AUGUST
1988.  IN OCTOBER, THE GROUP BLEW UP THE LINES PROVIDING POWER TO LA
PAZ, RESULTING IN A POWER OUTAGE THERE.  THE GROUP ALSO CLAIMED CREDIT
FOR THE JANUARY DYNAMITE BOMBING IN THE CONGRESS.

   THE MURDER TOOK PLACE AT 2220 LAST NIGHT AND, 30 MINUTES LATER, THE
TERRORISTS LEFT MESSAGES WITH LOCAL NEWSPAPERS CLAIMING TO BE THE
ASSAILANTS.

   THE MESSAGE, WHICH WAS HANDRITTEN, SAID: "THE VIOLATION OF OUR
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY CANNOT REMAIN UNPUNISHED.  THIS IS A WARNING TO
THE YANKEE INVADERS WHO COME HERE TO MASSACRE OUR PEASANT BROTHERS AND
TO THEIR LACKEYS.  WE POOR HAVE NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO TAKE UP ARMS.
OUR HATRED IS IMPLACABLE, AND OUR WAR IS TO THE DEATH.  FAL, ZARATE
WILKA."

   THE U.S. CITIZENS -- TODD RAY WILSON BURDENSON AND JEFFREY BRENT
BALL -- WERE MISSIONARIES OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS
(HEADQUARTERED IN UTAH), WHICH, IN RECENT YEARS, HAS EXTENDED ITS
ACTIVITIES IN BOLIVIA BY BUILDING DOZENS OF TEMPLES.  BOTH
MISSIONARIES HAD LIVED IN THE VICINITY OF THE GENERAL CEMETERY LOCATED
IN A DENSELY POPULATED LA PAZ DISTRICT.  THEY WERE KILLED WITH TWO
BURSTS OF MACHINEGUN FIRE.

   A MORMON CHURCH SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THIS WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST "TWO
INNOCENT PEOPLE" AND CALLED ON THE POLICE TO SOLVE THE MURDER.  HE
SAID THAT LAST YEAR DYNAMITE WAS PLACED AT A TEMPLE IN THE SAME AREA
BUT THAT THE CULPRITS WERE NEVER IDENTIFIED.

   THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ORDERED AN
IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION.  DEPUTY INTERIOR MINISTER WALTER COSTAS
ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRAFFIC AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS WILL CARRY OUT
DRAGNETS IN LA PAZ.

   THE KILLING OF THE U.S. MISSIONARIES HAS COINCIDED WITH THE ARRIVAL
IN BOLIVIA OF THE FIRST CONTINGENT OF U.S. MILITARY ENGINEERS,
TECHNICIANS, AND TROOPS, WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE TASK OF LEVELING
PATTI-PATTI HILL TO BUILD AN AIRPORT FOR THE CITY OF POTOSI.

   SANTIAGO, 29 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] POLICE TODAY REPORTED THAT
DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS TERRORISTS STAGED THREE BOMB ATTACKS AGAINST
U.S. PROPERTIES.

   NO ONE HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS SO FAR.  THEY
AFFECTED THE U.S.-CHILEAN CULTURAL INSTITUTE, A MORMON CHURCH IN THE
CAPITAL, AND A BRANCH OF THE "CITICORP" FINANCIAL FIRM IN VINA DEL
MAR, 125 KM NORTHEAST OF SANTIAGO.

   CARABINEROS HAVE REPORTED THAT A BOMB, WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE 5TH
FLOOR OF THE CHILEAN-U.S. CULTURAL INSTITUTE, 150 METERS FROM THE
GOVERNMENT PALACE, WENT OFF LAST NIGHT CAUSING DAMAGE BUT NO VICTIMS.

   THE BOMB HAD BEEN MANUFACTURED WITH L KILO OF AMMONIUM GELAGNITE
AND WAS ACTIVATED WITH A FUSE, POLICE SOURCES SAID.

   AT 0LL5 THIS MORNING (0415 GMT) INCENDIARY BOMBS WERE HURLED AT A
MORMON TEMPLE AT NUNOA DISTRICT, IN SANTIAGO.  THE BOMBS CAUSED MINOR
DAMAGE.  AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK THE BUILDING WAS EMPTY, ACCORDING
TO THE SOURCES.

   THE ATTACKERS PAINTED THE WALLS AND LEFT PAMPHLETS WITH
ULTRA-LEFTIST MESSAGES OF THE LAUTARO YOUTH FRONT.

   A BOMB, WHICH SHATTERED THE GLASSES AND DESTROYED THE MASONRY OF
THE "CITICORP" FINANCIAL COMPANY OFFICES IN DOWNTOWN VINA DEL MAR,
EXPLODED TODAY SHORTLY AFTER 0200 (0500 GMT).

   THE POLICE REPORTED THAT ANOTHER BOMB WAS DISCOVERED AND DEFUSED
BEFORE IT EXPLODED AT A CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN VINA DEL MAR.

   A FEW DAYS AGO, THE CHILEAN-U.S. CULTURAL INSTITUTES IN VINA DEL
MAR, TALCA, AND TEMUCO WERE THE TARGET OF BOMB ATTACKS.

   THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR), WHICH THE PINOCHET
REGIME CONSIDERS TO BE THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S ARMED BRANCH, ANNOUNCED
FOLLOWING THE U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA THAT IT WOULD ATTACK "U.S.
INTERESTS IN CHILE."

CLAIMING THAT HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO UNDUE PRESSURE BY THE

[MARIBEL OSORIO] [TEXT] A COLOMBIAN JUDGE HAS PAID THE HIGHEST PRICE
FOR DOING HER DUTY.  MARIA ELENA DIAZ PEREZ, THIRD JUDGE OF PUBLIC
ORDER, AND TWO OF HER BODYGUARDS FROM THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY], WERE ASSASSINATED IN MEDELLIN TODAY BY A
GROUP OF 10 PAID ASSASSINS IN TWO CARS, A MAZDA AND WHAT WAS THOUGHT
TO BE A MERCURY.

   SHE WAS TRAVELING HOME IN HER CAR TODAY AT NOON.  ABOUT HALF A
BLOCK FROM HER HOME, HER CAR, A TOYOTA WITH LICENSE PLATE NO. A-3037,
WAS INTERCEPTED BY A WHITE MAZDA AND POSSIBLY A MERCURY. DIAZ' DRIVER
HAD TO HIT THE BRAKES, AS THE MOTORCYCLE OF ONE OF HER BODYGUARDS
SLAMMED INTO THE REAR OF HER CAR.  IN A MATTER OF SECONDS, THE 10 PAID
ASSASSINS OPENED FIRE ON THE JUDGE'S CAR.  A TOTAL OF 55 9-MM
SUBMACHINE GUN ROUNDS HIT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR. THE JUDGE, WHO WAS
SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT, WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE CAR AND RUN, BUT SHE
WAS ONLY ABLE TO TAKE A FEW STEPS BEFORE BEING GUNNED DOWN BY 19
BULLETS. TWO OF HER DAS BODYGUARDS, DAGOBERTO RODRIGUEZ AND ALFONSO DE
LIMA, WHO WERE INSIDE THE CAR, WERE KILLED INSTANTLY.

   NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED YET IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INCIDENT.  THE
TRUTH IS THAT THE MANY THREATS MADE AGAINST HER BECAME A REALITY
TODAY.

   MARIA ELENA DIAZ, 34, WILL BE BURIED IN MEDELLIN TOMORROW.

   BOGOTA, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [BARCO] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [BARCO] ACTUALLY, THAT IS NOT SO, BECAUSE WHILE WE ARE
GATHERED HERE THE TENTACLES OF THE DRUG TRADE ARE CLOSING IN ON EUROPE
AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  THE AGGGRESSIVE SEARCH FOR NEW MARKETS DOES NOT
RESPECT OCEANS, JUST AS IT HAS NOT RESPECTED BORDERS.  ANYWHERE THERE
ARE CONSUMERS, THERE WILL BE SUPPLIERS.  IN FACT, COCAINE IS BUT ONE
OF THE PERNICIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THE CRISIS OF DRUG ABUSE, WHICH IS
MUCH BROADER.  WE MUST NOT DELUDE OURSELVES.  THIS SCOURGE AFFECTS US
ALL.

   ACTING IN SOLIDARITY, AS A COMMUNITY OF NATIONS, WE MUST FOLLOW
THIS PLAN OF ACTION:

   FIRST, IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO EFFECTIVELY CURB THE DEMAND FOR
ILLEGAL DRUGS.  DRUG ABUSE IS THE FUEL THAT PROPELS NARCOTERRORISM.
TODAY IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO LATIN AMERICAN
DEMOCRACIES.  COCAINE USERS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE KILLING OF MY
PEOPLE BY THE CRIMINAL INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION.
WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, IN ANY OF THE DISTINGUISHED RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
OF THIS CITY, A HABITUAL COCAINE USER MAY REGARD MY ASSERTION AS AN
EXAGGERATION.  NEVERTHELESS, HIS VICE MAKES HIM A COLLABORATOR OF THE
MURDERERS WHO HAVE KILLED MANY COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND POLICEMEN, WHO
HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY AND LAW.  [APPLAUSE]

   NO WEAPON OR TACTIC USED IN THIS STRUGGLE WILL BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH
IF IT IS NOT COMBINED WITH RESOLUTE EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE DEMAND.  THE
ILLEGAL PROFITS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE.  I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL DEFEAT
THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN COLOMBIA, BUT SOMEONE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY,
SOMEWHERE, WILL TAKE OVER THIS BUSINESS AS LONG AS IT REMAINS SO
PROFITABLE.  THIS HAPPENED WITH MARIJUANA.  WHEN IT BECAME TOO COSTLY
FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO OPERATE IN COLOMBIA BECAUSE OF THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PUBLIC FORCES, THE TRADERS IN VICE MOVED THEIR
PLANTATIONS TO CALIFORNIA, TO HAWAII, AND TO MANY OTHER REGIONS.  THE
ONLY LAW THE DRUG RUNNERS DO NOT VIOLATE IS THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND
DEMAND.  [APPLAUSE]

   NO SOCIETY, REGARDLESS OF HOW WEALTHY IT IS, CAN AFFORD THE LUXURY
OF ALLOWING ITS SONS OR DAUGHTERS TO POISON THEMSELVES WITH COCAINE,
HEROIN, MARIJUANA, OR ANY OTHER SUCH DEADLY DRUGS.  IN THIS CONTEXT, I
WISH TO ASSERT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN TO CURB THE DEMAND IS A
FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  WE MUST INSIST ON THE MESSAGE THAT
ILLEGAL DRUGS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE OR HARMLESS, WHETHER THEY ARE
CONSUMED IN THE GLITTERING PARTIES OF THE RICH OR IN THE SLUMS.

   BOGOTA, 6 MAR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [COLOMBIAN
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS, IN PROGRESS] [TEXT] ...NOT ONLY OF
THE PROVISIONS OF THE ANDEAN PACT, BUT ALSO OF THE VAST HORIZONS OF
THE CARIBBEAN AND THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REGION.  AS WE JOIN EFFORTS, AS
WE STRENGTHEN OUR CAPABILITIES, AND WITH THE LONG TRADITION OF
DEMOCRACY THAT WE SHARE, WE CAN OFFER OUR CONTRIBUTION TO
STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY.  ALL THE DEMOCRATS OF THE AMERICAS WHO
SEE IN YOU, MR. PRESIDENT PEREZ, A GREAT FIGHTER, ARE NOW CELEBRATING
A POSITIVE WAVE OF LEGITIMATE ELECTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE IN URUGUAY,
CHILE, BRAZIL, COSTA RICA, AND NICARAGUA.  VERY SHORTLY COLOMBIA AND
LATER PERU WILL HOLD ELECTIONS.  PANAMA, IN TURN, HAS CALLED FOR
POPULAR CONSULTATION IN THE FORM OF A REFERENDUM SO THAT THE PEOPLE
WILL DECIDE ON IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.

   THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, DEMOCRACY IS THE PATH AND THAT IS WHY IT
WILL BE THE ADEQUATE MEANS FOR STRENGTHENING THE OAS AS A REGIONAL
ORGANIZATION IN WHICH THE VARIOUS TRENDS AND IDEOLOGIES WITHIN A
COMMON OBJECTIVE OF SEARCHING FOR PEACE, FREEDOM, LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE
MAY AND SHOULD BE EXPRESSED AND CONSULTED ON.  THERE, THE MEMBERS WILL
BE ABLE TO DISCUSS TOPICS THAT AFFECT US IN A DIRECT MANNER, SUCH AS
INTERNATIONAL TRADE, FOREIGN DEBT, AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION, AS WELL
AS HOW TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ACTION WITH VARIOUS INTERLOCUTORS,
SUCH AS THE CASE OF CANADA, THE ENTRY IF WHICH INTO THE OAS WE WARMLY
WELCOME.

   THEREFORE, LET US CONSIDER THE REASONS FOR THIS MEETING WHICH WE DO
NOT HESITATE IN TERMING HISTORIC.  THE DOCUMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF HOW
MUCH WE HAVE ADVANCED IN SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIELDS OF
ENERGY, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION, AND BORDER TRANSIT; IN JOINT
PROGRAMS IN CITY PLANNING SUCH AS THE CUCUTA-VILLA EL ROSARIO-SAN
ANTONIO-URENA; IN THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECTORS, AND
IN INDIAN ETHNIC GROUPS, CUSTOMS, AND EDUCATION.  ALL OF THESE ARE
TOPICS WE HAVE DISCUSSED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH OUR RESPECTIVE
TEAMS.  HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE TOPIC THAT I WISH TO EMPHASIZE.

   THERE IS AN ENEMY WHO SEEKS TO DESTROY THE INTEGRATIONIST AND
DEMOCRATIC PROJECT.  THERE ARE ANACHRONISTIC REDOUBTS OF A SUBVERSIVE
NATURE THAT ARE TODAY ENFENCED BY OUR MILITARY FORCES AND OUR HARD
WORKING PEOPLE.  THE ENEMY FEELS HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND HE
EXPRESSES HIMSELF THOUGH VIOLENT ACTIONS WITH KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION,
AND INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM; BY DESTROYING OIL PIPELINES AND
CONTAMINATING RIVERS, WATER BASINS, AND LAGOONS.  OUR COMMISSIONS HAVE
SUGGESTED POSITIVE MEANS FOR WORKING JOINTLY ON THESE RIVERS, WATER
BASINS, AND LAGOONS, AND HAVE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT IS ALREADY
BEING IMPLEMENTED ON OIL SPILLS AND ACCIDENTS.

   COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL OVER THIS INTERNAL ENEMY, AND
UNDOUBTEDLY THE INTEGRATION PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE WITH RENEWED VIGOR.
THE TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER RESOUCES, THE ELECTRICITY AND
TELEPHONE INTERCONNECTIONS, THE FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR THE VARIOUS
ALTERNATE ROUTES THAT WILL CONNECT US, THE REOPENING OF THE BRIDGES
THAT WERE CLOSED 30 YEARS AGO, THE UTILIZATION OF THE CAMILO DAZA
AIRPORT IN CUCUTA AS AN ALTERNATE AIRPORT FOR SAN ANTONIO, THE
AGREEMENT ON FISHING POLICIES, THE PLANS TO INCREASE CROPS RANGING
FROM SUGARCANE AND COTTON TO CHIQUI-CHIQUI FIBER ARE POSITIVE ANSWERS
TO THOSE WHO INSIST ON DISRUPTING THINGS.

   THE INTERNATIONAL POLICY TODAY NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE TRADITIONAL
CONCEPT AND THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, BUT ABOVE ALL,
IT POINTS TO PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING AND INCREASES THEIR CAPABILITIES FOR
CONSUMPTION.  IT IS NOT BY BLOWING UP OIL PIPELINES OR PREVENTING THE
PEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONG THE RIVER BANKS OF BOTH COUNTRIES FROM FISHING
OR BY POISONING THEIR CROPS THAT PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING WILL BE ACHIEVED.

   I AM SURE THAT THE SAN PEDRO ALEJANDRINO DOCUMENT WE SIGNED TODAY
IS A GRADUAL, BUT DECISIVE STEP TOWARD AUTHENTIC LATIN AMERICAN
INTEGRATION.  BY THE DECISION OF THEIR PEOPLE AND PROMOTED BY THEIR
RULERS IN THIS SIMPLE ROOM WHERE THE LIBERATOR DIED, WE ARE TODAY
CONSOLIDATING THESE BASES THAT WILL NOT BE DESTROYED AND WILL PREVENT
IN THE FUTURE ANY FURTHER FRUSTRATIONS OF THE DREAMS OF THE LIBERATOR,
BOLIVAR.

   MIXED COMMISSIONS WILL BE APPOINTED SHORTLY AND WILL GET DOWN TO
WORK IN WHAT WE STILL HAVE YET TO DO.  THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH A TRULY
LIBERATING TASK, THAT TODAY -- AS FROM THE TIMES OF THE CONGRESS OF
ANGOSTURA -- IS UNITING OUR TWO NATIONS.  THANK YOU.  [APPLAUSE]

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 APR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] A SALVADORAN COURT
YESTERDAY PRESENTED A SWORN DECLARATION BY PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON
DUARTE IN WHICH HE LINKS RIGHTIST LEADER ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON TO THE
MARCH 1980 ASSASSINATION OF ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.

   THE DECLARATION, WHICH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE REQUESTED FROM
THE FOURTH PENAL COURT, DID NOT PROVIDE DETAILS REGARDING EVIDENCE
THAT COULD BE USED TO SOLVE THE CASE OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, WHO WAS A
STAUNCH CRITIC OF THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ITS ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS.

   THE DOCUMENT CONTAINS A LIST OF THE NAMES OF 12 ARMY OFFICERS AND
12 CIVILIANS WHO WERE ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN PLOTTING TO OUST THE
REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT JUNTA THAT TOOK OVER IN OCTOBER 1979 AFTER
OVERTHROWING GENERAL HUMBERTO ROMERO.

   THE LIST OF PLOTTERS INCLUDES RIGHTIST DEPUTY D'AUBUISSON, FOUNDER
OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) -- THE WINNER IN THE
RECENT ELECTIONS -- AND CAPTAIN ALVARO SARAVIA, WHOM THE PRESIDENT
ACCUSED OF BEING THE MASTERMINDS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE
CLERGYMAN.

   THE LIST ALSO INCLUDES THE NAMES OF CIVILIANS INVOLVED IN THE
KIDNAPPING OF SEVERAL SALVADORAN BUSINESSMEN EARLY IN THE DECADE.

   ACCORDING TO DUARTE'S DECLARATION, 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE SOLDIERS
ARRESTED THE 24 COUP PLOTTERS IN 1980, AND SEVERAL DOCUMENTS WERE
SEIZED FROM THEM, INCLUDING A NOTEBOOK WITH PLANS FOR KILLING ROMERO.

   THE U.S. SENATE HAS A NOTEBOOK OWNED BY CAPT SARAVIA, AND
SALVADORAN JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING HOW THE U.S.  SENATE
ENDED UP WITH IT.

   ACCORDING TO DUARTE, "COLONEL ADOLFO ARNULFO MAJANO, A MEMBER OF
THE REVOLUTIONARY JUNTA THAT OUSTED GEN ROMERO, HAD THE DOCUMENTS."

   THE SALVADORAN SUPREME COURT RECENTLY REVOKED A SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT EXTRADITION REQUEST FOR SARAVIA, WHOM THE GOVERNMENT WANTED
TO QUESTION TO HELP SOLVE THE ROMERO CASE.

   THE ARCHBISHOP WAS KILLED BY A SNIPER WHILE SAYING MASS AT A
HOSPITAL FOR CANCER PATIENTS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 SEP 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [STATEMENT] [JOAQUIN
VILLALOBOS, COMMANDER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO INCREASE
THE POSSIBILITIES OF REACHING AN AGREEMENT.  AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE
THIS MEETING AND OTHERS THAT MAY COME CAN BE DESCRIBED AS SERIOUS
DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION.  WE HAVE MADE AN EFFORT SO THAT THE
DELEGATIONS CAN HOLD ENOUGH DECISION-MAKING POWER FOR AGREEMENTS TO BE
REACHED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  I SAID EARLIER THAT OUR PROPOSAL IS
AIMED AT ACHIEVING THE COUNTRY'S REAL DEMOCRATIZATION.  WE HAVE MADE
AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL.  WE ARE NOT ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO
GIVE UP THE LEGITIMACY IT SAYS IT HAS OBTAINED IN THE ELECTIONS.  WE
ARE ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SUBMIT IT TO A TEST FOR THE SAKE OF
PEACE.  IF IT PASSES THE TEST, THEN IT WOULD REAFFIRM ITS POWER.
OTHERWISE, WE WERE ALWAYS RIGHT TO DEMAND A NEW CONSENSUS FOR
ACHIEVING PEACE IN THE COUNTRY.

   ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS THEY SAID THAT OUR PROPOSALS VIOLATED THE
CONSTITUTION.  WE HAVE MADE A GREAT EFFORT, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT
WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE IT WAS MADE TO PROMOTE
THE WAR.  THE CONSTITUTION WAS DRAFTED BASED ON THE KILLING OF OVER
70,000 SALVADORANS.  THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY DOES NOT REPRESENT A
LARGE PART OF SALVADORAN SOCIETY, BUT WE HAVE MADE AN EFFORT SO THAT
THERE ARE NO OBSTACLES TO REACHING AN AGREEMENT.  WE HOPE A NEW
CONSTITUTION FOR PEACE CAN BE DRAFTED.

   THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT AT THE BEGINNING
THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION INSISTED ON PERFORMING CERTAIN TASKS WHICH
WE THOUGHT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT.  WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE WRONG IDEA OF WHAT A DIALOGUE IS.
WE BELIEVE THAT TO EXTEND THE DIALOGUE IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT, IN THE
FRAMEWORK OF THE EXISTING PRESSURE IN THE COUNTRY, IS TO EXTEND THE
WAR.  TO HOLD A DIALOGUE FULL OF DETAILS AND AGREEMENTS OF LITTLE
IMPORTANCE IS TO EXTEND THE WAR.

OMITTED] [ALVARENGAS] COMMANDER FERMAN CIENFUEGOS, WHEN WILL THE
DIALOGUE RESUME?

   [SANCHO] WE BELIEVE THAT FOR THE DIALOGUE TO BE RESUMED THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, MAINLY COLONELS PONCE AND ELENA, AND
CRISTIANI MUST SPECIFICALLY ACCEPT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.  WE BELIEVE
THAT ONCE THIS SITUATION AND ALL THE POLITICAL ACTIONS FOR WHICH THEY
ARE RESPONSIBLE HAVE BEEN CLARIFIED....  [CHANGES THOUGHT] THEY HAVE
TO EXPLAIN THINGS VERY CLEARLY BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY TIRED OF HEARING
THE FAMOUS PHRASE THAT THEY ALWAYS USE; THAT IS, THAT THEY ARE GOING
TO INVESTIGATE.  THAT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE; THEREFORE, WE ARE
DEMANDING THAT THE SITUATION BE CLARIFIED.

   MEANWHILE, WE ARE GOING TO TALK TO THE OBSERVERS AND MEDIATORS TO
CHECK ON HOW THE SITUATION IS DEVELOPING AND AT THE SAME TIME TO STUDY
THE CONDITIONS FOR THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION.  I BELIEVE THAT THE
NATURE OF THE SUSPENSION HAS BEEN WELL EXPLAINED.  THESE CONDITIONS
MUST BE MET BEFORE WE CAN, LET US SAY, RESUME THE MEETING.  IT MUST BE
MADE VERY CLEAR THAT THE AGREEMENT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THE CONTINUITY
OF THE DIALOGUE, HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN.  THIS WAS AGREED ON BY THE TWO
PARTIES, AND THIS IS NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.  WHAT WE DID WAS
SUSPEND THE MEETING THAT HAS CREATED SO MANY EXPECTATIONS.  THE SAN
JOSE AGREEMENT STATED THAT THERE WOULD BE A CEASE-FIRE AND A GRADUAL
PROCESS TO PUT AN END TO HOSTILITIES THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE END OF THE
WAR; HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE DONE, WE MUST
FIRST HAVE SPECIFIC DEMOCRATIC CONDITIONS.  THAT IS WHAT CRISTIANI
SIGNED IN TELA, HONDURAS.  WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE IS THE UNMASKING OF
A FASCIST DICTATORSHIP.  WE ARE SEEING A FASCIST AND TERRORIST CLIQUE.
THE MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS ARE PRACTICALLY LEGAL IN EL SALVADOR.

REJECTED AND SPURNED THEM WHEN THEY TRIED TO EXPOSE THE PEOPLE TO SO
MUCH DANGER AND HARM.

   IT WAS ALSO SATISFACTORY TO HEAR THE MANY STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT AND
SOLIDARITY GIVEN BY SO MANY SALVADORANS. THEY HAVE TALKED THROUGH THE
NATIONAL NETWORK AND EVERY OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, AND HAVE
REJECTED AND SPURNED THE FMLN AND ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS.  FURTHERMORE,
THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND THE MINISTRIES OF AGRICULTURE AND ECONOMY
ARE DRAFTING A PROGRAM TO HELP THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH HAVE BEEN
AFFECTED BY THE FMLN'S ACTIONS--ONCE EVERYTHING IS CALM--AND TO
RESUPPLY THE SUPERMARKETS AND STORES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE KNOW
THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS GETTING FOOD FOR THE LAST 2 AND 1/2 DAYS
AND THE SUPPLIES SHOULD BE BROUGHT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE DO NOT WANT TO END THIS ADDRESS WITHOUT
STATING OUR DEEP GRATITUDE FOR YOUR--AND THE OTHER SALVADORAN
PEOPLE'S--COURAGEOUS ATTITUDE IN THE FACE OF THE FMLN AGGRESSION. WE
CAN ONLY FEEL PROUD ABOUT THE MESSAGES OF SUPPORT--NOT FOR US ON A
PERSONAL BASIS BUT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, THE RIGHTS THAT THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE DEMAND--AND FOR THE SUPPORT GIVEN TO THE ARMED
FORCES, WHOSE MORALE IS HIGH AND WHO TAKE PRIDE IN THE PROFESSIONALISM
WHICH THEY HAVE ACQUIRED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS TO COUNTER THE SITUATION
IN THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE.

   WE KNOW THAT THE FMLN HAS FAILED, AND NOW IT IS A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE ARMED FORCES MANAGE TO TURN THE SITUATION AROUND
COMPLETELY. ALSO, WE WANT TO STATE OUR DEEP GRATITUDE TO THE FRIENDLY
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THEIR SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY-- MOST OF ALL
THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH YOU, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE-- BECAUSE THERE HAVE
BEEN STATEMENTS WHICH, FRANKLY, HAVE FILLED US WITH EMOTION. FOR
EXAMPLE, THOSE OF COSTA RICA, THE UNITED STAES, GUATEMALA, AND, IN
SHORT, ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW IRRATIONAL
THE FMLN'S AGGRESSION IS. THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE REPUBLIC, WHICH ARE THE RESULT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S WILL,
HAVE BEGUN A RATIONAL, PEACEFUL, AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO ACHIEVE
PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.

   TO CONCLUDE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND
UNDERSTANDING; BUT ALSO YOUR TRUST AND SERENITY. YOU CAN REST ASSURED
THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL EMERGE VICTORIOUS FROM
THE AGGRESSION WHICH THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE LAUNCHED. IT IS A
DESPERATE ACTION AND, IN COUNTERING THE SITUATION, WE WILL BE MUCH
CLOSER TO THE PEACE WE WANT SO MUCH. MAY GOD BLESS
YOU ALL AND THANK YOU.

TST1-MUC3-0091

   CLANDESTINE, 28 MAR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WHEN NAPOLEON
DUARTE WAS PROCLAIMED PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR IN 1984, THE WHITE
HOUSE, STATE DEPARTMENT, PENTAGON, AND ALL THE POWERFUL CIRCLES IN THE
UNITED STATES WERE STRICKEN WITH EUPHORIA AND OPTIMISM.  DUARTE
PROMISED A SOCIAL PACT, A TOLERANT REGIME, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
REFORMS, AND, MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, HE PROMISED PEACE.

   ALL OF THESE PROMISES WERE ONLY A MEANS OF ACHIEVING WASHINGTON'S
GREAT OBJECTIVE: TO CONTROL THE REVOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR OR, IN OTHER
WORDS, COUNTERINSURGENCY.  FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN.  IN
REALITY 8 YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE EL SALVADOR BECAME THE PLACE WHERE
THE REAGAN ERA'S MODELS OF COUNTERINSURGENCY, NEODICTATORSHIP, AND
LOW-INTENSITY WARFARE WERE IMPLEMENTED.

   WASHINGTON'S EUPHORIA AND OPTIMISM HAVE COMPLETELY VANISHED.  THE
19 MARCH ELECTIONS SEALED THE COLLAPSE OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S
SALVADORAN STRATEGY.  TWO BASIC FACTORS ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE U.S.
FAILURE: FIRST, THE UNITED STATES SOUGHT DEMAGOGIC AND POLITICALLY
UNSOUND REFORMS.  DUARTE DID NOT IN ANY WAY IMPROVE THE MASSES'
EXTREME POVERTY AND ISOLATION.  SECOND, THE REVOLUTIONARY, POPULAR,
AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES' QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PROGRESS WAS
POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS THAT LED TO THE CONFLICT ARE--TODAY MORE
THAN EVER--STILL UNRESOLVED.

   THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS RESULTED IN AN ARENA VICTORY, AND ARENA IS
THE PARTY THAT REPRESENTS THE MOST ULTRACONSERVATIVE OLIGARCHIC
SECTORS.  WASHINGTON HAS RETURNED TO ITS STARTING POINT.  THE $3
BILLION SPENT ON MILITARY ADVICE AND THE GENOCIDE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF SALVADORANS SERVED NO PURPOSE WHATSOEVER.  IT IS ALL OVER.  ARENA
REPRESENTS A RETURN TO THE SYSTEM USED PRIOR TO 15 OCTOBER 1979.  IN
OTHER WORDS, IT IS A RETURN TO DICTATORIAL CONTROL OF ALL POLITICAL,
ECONOMIC, AND MILITARY POWER.  THIS IS THE END, THE SAD END OF THE
LOW-INTENSITY WAR EXERCISE.

   U.S. GENERAL HARRY GORDON SUMMER, A MEMBER OF THE SANTA FE GROUP,
IN HIS BOOK ON THE MISTAKES THE UNITED STATES MADE IN VIETNAM, SAID
THE UNITED STATES' CONCEPT OF VICTORY AFTER ITS DEFEAT IN VIETNAM CAN
NO LONGER BE TO ACHIEVE ITS ENEMY'S UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER, AS IN
WORLD WAR II, BUT TO ACHIEVE THE POLITICAL OBJECTIVES FOR WHICH IT
STARTED THE WAR.  THIS IS PRECISELY THE CONCEPT OF VICTORY USED IN
LOW-INTENSITY WARFARE.  ARENA'S VICTORY, AND THE SUBSEQUENT RETURN TO
THE OLD SYSTEM, IS OBVIOUSLY CONTRARY TO THE OBJECTIVE OF
LOW-INTENSITY WARFARE.

   FOR WASHINGTON, OF COURSE, THIS DEFEAT MEANS THAT $3 BILLION WAS
SQUANDERED.  FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND CENTRAL AMERICANS, IT MEANS
RAZED TOWNS, DEVASTATED ECONOMIES, AND THE DEATH OF 70,000 PEOPLE.
THE NEW U.S.  ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT HAVE A DEFINITE PLAN FOR EL
SALVADOR.  WHAT IT HAS IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE ALLY, ARENA, AND A SOCIAL
TIME BOMB ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

   THE FMLN BELIEVES THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SHOULD STUDY THE NEW
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IN A REALISTIC AND
PRAGMATIC MANNER.  THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR CONTINUES AND WILL CONTINUE
AS LONG AS THERE IS NO CHANGE, NO REAL CHANGE, TO BENEFIT THE MASSES
THAT ARE STRUGGLING FOR THAT CHANGE.  THIS IS OUR NEW REALITY, AND IF
THE NEW U.S.  ADMINISTRATION WANTS PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE REGION,
IT MUST ESTABLISH A FOREIGN POLICY THAT REFLECTS THAT REALITY.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] 4.
AT 0640 AN FMLN GUERRILLA UNIT LAUNCHED AN ATTACK ON CONCHAGUA
BATTALION AND 3D MILITARY DETACHMENT SOLDIERS WHO WERE TRAVELING ON
THE ROAD BETWEEN ANAMOROS AND LISLIQUE, 1 KM FROM LISLIQUE, LA UNION
DEPARTMENT.  THE CLASH, CARRIED OUT IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, ENDED AT 0930.
WE KILLED THREE AND WOUNDED FIVE, AND TOOK FOUR PRISONERS OF WAR IN
THAT AREA OF LA UNION DEPARTMENT.  A CHIEF OF SECTION, A SERGEANT, IS
AMONG THE DEAD.  WE SEIZED SIX RIFLES, AN M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHER, AND
[WORDS INDISTINCT].  MEANWHILE, ANOTHER FMLN UNIT ENTERED LISLIQUE,
WHERE THEY CARRIED OUT POLITICAL ACTIVITIES FOR 3 HOURS.

   5.  AT 0300 FMLN UNITS ATTACKED AN INFANTRY COMPANY AT THE MOUTH OF
THE LEMPA RIVER, AND 30 MINUTES LATER OUR FORCES HAD TAKEN OVER THE
POST.  WE KILLED ONE AND WOUNDED FOUR, AND SEIZED A RIFLE, A LAW
ROCKET LAUNCHER, THREE BACKPACKS, AND WAR MATERIEL.

   6.  URBAN GUERRILLAS SABOTAGED PYLONS AND TRANSFORMERS IN SAN
MIGUEL CITY.

   7.  A NATIONAL POLICE POST IN BERLIN WAS RAIDED AND ATTACKED.

   ATTENTION: DURING THIS OPERATION LAUNCHED THROUGHOUT THE FOUR
EASTERN DEPARTMENTS, WE INFLICTED A TOTAL OF 67 CASUALTIES.  AMONG
THESE CASUALTIES ARE: THE CHIEF OF THE CACAHUATIQUE BATTALION, A
CAPTAIN, A LIEUTENANT, AND A SERGEANT.  WE CAPTURED SIX PRISONERS OF
WAR DURING THIS OPERATION.  WE ALSO SEIZED 37 RIFLES, A 90-MM CANNON,
2 M-70 MACHINE GUNS, 3 LAW ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 3 M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHERS,
5 MILITARY RADIOS, 38 BACKPACKS, AND 6,800 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, AND
WE DAMAGED A HELICOPTER.  THIS IS THE RESULT OF OUR OPERATION: THE
EASTERN SECTOR IS COURAGEOUS; EVERYONE AGAINST ARENA.

A PLURALIST GOVERNMENT WHICH INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE
PATRIOTIC GROUPS OF THE NATION.  LET US SAVE OUR CAPITAL, WHICH IS
BEING BOMBED DUE TO A FOREIGN MENTALITY.  IT IS BEING BOMBED AND
DESTROYED BY AN OCCUPATION ARMY.  THE AIRPLANES ARE NOW BEING FLOWN BY
U.S. PILOTS AT NIGHT, AND THEY HAVE THE MENTALITY OF AN OCCUPATION
ARMY.

   SALVADORANS, LET US UNITE AND ORGANIZE OURSELVES.  LET US NOT
REMAIN IDLE.  WE MUST MOBILIZE OURSELVES RIGHT NOW AND ORGANIZE A
COMMITTEE IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN.  THE
PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE.  THE FMLN HAS BEGUN ITS 7TH DAY IN THE CAPITAL,
AND WE ARE SURE THAT WE ARE ADVANCING TOWARD VICTORY.  VICTORY WILL BE
OURS AND COLONEL PONCE HAS GIVEN PROOF OF HIS DESPERATION WITH THE
JESUIT PRIESTS' ASSASSINATION IN SAN SALVADOR.  HE HAS OVERSTEPPED HIS
MARK AND THE PEOPLE'S PATIENCE IS EXHAUSTED.  WE URGE ALL OUR PEOPLE
TO JOIN THE GENERAL UPRISING, STRUGGLE, TAKE UP WEAPONS, AND ORGANIZE
EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO OUST THIS CORRUPT AND MURDEROUS REGIME.  WE
URGE THE PEOPLE TO MOBILIZE,TO TAKE UP WEAPONS, AND TO STAY IN THE
NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS TO STRUGGLE FOR THE LIBERATION OF
OUR HOMELAND.  WE MUST ACHIEVE PROGRESS.

   INFORMATION HAS JUST ARRIVED FROM THE UNITED STATES, INDICATING
THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO WITHDRAW ITS UNCONDITIONAL
SUPPORT FOR THE DEATH SQUADS IN EL SALVADOR.  INFORMATION RECEIVED
FROM THE UNITED STATES INDICATES THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO
RECANT ITS IRRESPONSIBLE AND GENOCIDAL ATTITUDE OF SENDING U.S.
PILOTS TO BOMB OUR CAPITAL BY NIGHT.  THAT IS THE PROFESSIONAL
TRAINING THAT U.S. IMPERIALISM IS CURRENTLY GIVING THE ARMED FORCES,
MEANING TO BOMB THE CAPITAL BY NIGHT, AS ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CAPITAL
HAVE WITNESSED IN RECENT HOURS.

   THUS, WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE: ORGANIZE YOURSELVES.  WE
WILL ACHIEVE VICTORY.  WE SURE OF THIS.  THE BLOOD OF IGNACIO
ELLACURIA, THE BLOOD OF THE JESUITS, THE BLOOD OF MONSIGNOR [ARNULFO]
ROMERO, THE BLOOD OF THE FOUR U.S. NUNS, THE BLOOD OF THE 11 PRIESTS
ASSASSINATED [WORDS INDISTINCT], THE BLOOD OF [WORDS INDISTINCT]
SEMINARIANS, YOUTHS [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND FOR ALL THE BLOOD SHED.
WE MUST WIN, WE MUST ACHIEVE VICTORY, WE MUST ATTAIN A TRUE DEMOCRACY
FOR OUR HOMELAND -- A DEMOCRACY WITH FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, FOOD,
EDUCATION, AND JUSTICE.

PILOTS WHO ARE HERE TO PARTICIPATE IN AIR BOMBINGS DURING THE NIGHT TO
RELIEVE THE TIRED AND GENOCIDAL PILOTS OF GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLO.

   WE URGE THE U.S. EMBASSY TO WITHDRAW THE U.S. PILOTS.  OTHERWISE,

LOCATED 4 KM NORTH OF THE CITY OF USULUTAN, WERE RELEASED.  PREVIOUS
REPORTS INDICATED THAT A TOTAL OF 25 SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED IN EL

   IN EARLIER REPORTS WE HAD UNDERSCORED THAT SINCE 1984, A BATTLE OF
SUCH PROPORTIONS HAD NOT BEEN STAGED IN FULL DAYLIGHT AGAINST
INFANTRY, ARTILLERY, AND AVIATION, AND IN THIS CASE, WE ESPECIALLY
UNDERSCORED THAT THE THEATER OF OPERATIONS HAD CHANGED AND A BATTLE
WAS STAGED IN A VITAL AREA FOR THE WAR ECONOMY.

   THE MUTINIOUS PRISONERS WORKED OUT A DETAILED PLAN AND ATTACKED

   TEGUCIGALPA, 6 FEB 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE HONDURAN POLICE
TODAY PRESENTED TO REPORTERS TWO OF THE PRESUMED KILLERS OF CONTRA
COMMANDER MANUEL RUGAMA ACEVEDO, ALIAS "AURELIANO."  ONE OF THE MEN
ACCUSED AN OFFICIAL OF THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA OF
INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIME.

   "AURELIANO," CONSIDERED TO BE THE SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS, WAS GUNNED DOWN BY AN UNIDENTIFIED GROUP IN
TEGUCIGALPA'S NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS ON 7 JANUARY AFTER ATTENDING A
WORKING MEETING WITH OTHER REBEL LEADERS.

   THE POLICE DETAINED HONDURANS JUAN BAUTISTA AND RIGOBERTO MATUTE
AND NICARAGUAN LUIS ORDONEZ, WHO ARE BEING HELD AS SUSPECTS IN
AURELIANO'S MURDER.  OTHER SUSPECTS ARE STILL BEING PURSUED.

   ONLY BAUTISTA AND ORDONEZ WERE PRESENTED TO REPORTERS.  MATUTE IS
BEING HELD OUTSIDE TEGUCIGALPA AS A WITNESS IN THE CASE.

   ORDONEZ SAID HE "PARTICIPATED ONLY AS A GO-BETWEEN" SO JOSE DE
JESUS PENA, THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL, COULD MEET MATUTE, WHO
WORKED AS A MESSENGER FOR ORDONEZ AT THE EXCHANGE OFFICE HE RUNS IN
TEGUCIGALPA.

   ORDONEZ ADDED: "I WAS AWARE THAT PENA WANTED TO GET RID OF
SOMEBODY, BUT I NEVER LEARNED WHO THEY WERE GOING TO KILL UNTIL
'AURELIANO' WAS ELIMINATED."

   ORDONEZ ALSO SAID HE WORKED FOR THE SOMOZA REGIME, THAT HE LATER
AIDED THE CONTRAS FINANCIALLY IN HONDURAS, PARTICULARLY THE REBEL
INDIAN ORGANIZATION MISURASATA [MISKITO, SUMU, AND RAMA SANDINIST
UNITY], AND THAT WIDCLIFE DIEGO, A MISURASATA LEADER, OWES HIM
$25,000.

   ORDONEZ SAID FURTHER THAT HE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON THE CONTRAS
SEVERAL TIMES TO THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY THROUGH PENA, WHO GAVE HIM
$1,000 ALMOST EVERY MONTH.

   ORDONEZ DENIED THAT HE PARTICIPATED DIRECTLY IN THE CRIME: "ON
SATURDAY, 7 JANUARY, WHEN 'AURELIANO' WAS KILLED, I WAS AT A COCK
FIGHT IN EL PROGRESO" ON HONDURAS' NORTHERN COAST.

   ORDONEZ SAID: "I ALSO WAS IN TOUCH WITH THE HONDURAN SECRET POLICE,
ONE OF WHOSE LIEUTENANTS, WORKING FOR INTERPOL, CALLED ME UP A FEW
DAYS AGO.  HE TOLD ME LATER, HOWEVER, THAT OTHER OFFICERS WANTED TO
SEE ME.  THAT IS HOW I WAS DETAINED."

   IN ADDITION, BAUTISTA CLAIMED THAT HE WAS HIRED BY MATUTE DURING
TWO MEETINGS THEY HELD AND THAT MATUTE OFFERED TO PAY HIM $10,000 TO
KILL SOMEBODY, PRESUMABLY A CONTRA COMMANDER WHO ALSO INTENDED TO KILL
MATUTE.

   BAUTISTA SAID THAT A FEW DAYS PRIOR TO THE CRIME, MATUTE INTRODUCED
TO HIM ANOTHER PERSON, CANO ARTEAGA, WHO IS STILL AT LARGE AND WHO
TOLD BAUTISTA THAT IT WAS ORDONEZ WHO WANTED THE MAN DEAD.

   BAUTISTA SAID THAT, ON THE DAY OF THE CRIME, HE MET WITH MATUTE AND
CANO.  THEY DROVE AROUND THE PLACE SEVERAL TIMES UNTIL THEY
INTERCEPTED THE CONTRA COMMANDER'S CAR.

   "I OPENED FIRE WITH A .38 CALIBER REVOLVER.  AURELIANO GOT OUT OF
THE CAR AND WAS HIT BY MATUTE'S SHOTS.  CANO FINISHED HIM OFF."

   BAUTISTA SAID HIS TWO COMPANIONS WERE ARMED WITH .45 CALIBER
PISTOLS.  AFTER THE CRIME, THEY WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS TO WAIT TO
RECEIVE THE PROMISED MONEY IN A TEGUCIGALPA PARK ON 15 FEBRUARY.

   POLICE SOURCES AND COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ, HEAD OF THE
HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' PUBLIC RELATIONS DEPARTMENT, WHO PRESENTED THE
CRIMINALS TO THE REPORTERS, DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE INVOLVEMENT OF
A NICARAGUAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN THE CRIME.

   SUAREZ SAID: "IT IS UP TO THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT TO COMMENT ON
THIS CASE OR TO TRY TO ESTABLISH WHETHER A DIPLOMAT PARTICIPATED.  THE
POLICE HAVE ALREADY DONE THEIR DUTY."

   THERE WAS NOBODY AVAILABLE AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA
TO COMMENT ON THE ALLEDGED INVOLVEMENT OF ONE OF THE EMBASSY OFFICIALS
IN THE ASSASSINATION.  THE EMBASSY WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY THAT
SOMEONE NAMED JOSE DE JESUS PENA WORKED THERE.

EMBASSY LOCATED IN ORRANTIA DISTRICT, NEAR SAN ISIDRO.

   POLICE SAID THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY AND
THAT THE BOMBS BROKE WINDOWS AND DESTROYED THE TWO VEHICLES.

   NO ONE HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS SO FAR. POLICE
SOURCES, HOWEVER, HAVE SAID THE ATTACKS COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY
THE MAOIST "SHINING PATH" GROUP OR THE GUEVARIST "TUPAC AMARU
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT" (MRTA) GROUP.  THE SOURCES ALSO SAID THAT THE
SHINING PATH HAS ATTACKED SOVIET INTERESTS IN PERU IN THE PAST.

   IN JULY 1989 THE SHINING PATH BOMBED A BUS CARRYING NEARLY 50
SOVIET MARINES INTO THE PORT OF EL CALLAO. FIFTEEN SOVIET MARINES WERE
WOUNDED.

   SOME 3 YEARS AGO TWO MARINES DIED FOLLOWING A SHINING PATH BOMBING
OF A MARKET USED BY SOVIET MARINES.

   IN ANOTHER INCIDENT 3 YEARS AGO, A SHINING PATH MILITANT WAS KILLED
BY SOVIET EMBASSY GUARDS INSIDE THE EMBASSY COMPOUND.  THE TERRORIST
WAS CARRYING DYNAMITE.

   THE ATTACKS TODAY COME AFTER SHINING PATH ATTACKS DURING WHICH
LEAST 10 BUSES WERE BURNED THROUGHOUT LIMA ON 24 OCT.

   LIMA, 1 APR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PERUVIAN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN
TODAY ENTERED ITS FINAL STRETCH, WITH ONLY ONE WEEK TO GO IN AN
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THAT HAS BEEN THE MOST DISPUTED AND DANGEROUS ONE
IN THE HISTORY OF THAT ANDEAN COUNTRY, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF TERRORIST
THREATS.

   THE SPREADING WAVE OF TERRORISM, AIMED AT STOPPING THE ELECTIONS
FROM TAKING PLACE, FORCED PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA'S ADMINISTRATION TO
TAKE DRASTIC SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE NEARLY 3,500 CANDIDATES
[PASSAGE INDISTINCT] ARE DEPLOYED, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS UNDER STATE OF
EMERGENCY AND WHERE THE ACTIVITIES OF SHINING PATH'S TERRORIST GANGS
ARE MORE WIDESPREAD, SUCH AS LIMA AND THE DEPARTMENTS OF AYACUCHO,
HUANCAVELICA, APURIMAC, AND JUNIN.

   THE GOVERNMENT HAS APPOINTED FOUR MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES TO
PROTECT EACH CANDIDATE AND HAS TAKEN OUT LIFE INSURANCE ON ALMOST
250,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED BY LOTTERY TO WORK AT OVER
52,000 POLLING STATIONS.  IN LIMA ALONE, HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS OF
POLLING STATION TEAMS HAVE ASKED TO BE RELIEVED OF THIS DUTY,
PETITIONS WHICH FOR THE MOST PART HAVE BEEN REFUSED BY THE THE
ELECTORAL COURT.

   IN LIMA, THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO NORMAL ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY COULD BE
THE STRIKE OF PRIVATE BUS OWNERS WHO ARE AFRAID OF TERRORIST
REPRISALS.  THE "MINI-BUS-OWNERS" (INDIVIDUAL OWNERS OF URBAN BUSES)
HAVE ASKED THAT FOUR POLICEMEN BE ASSIGNED TO EACH BUS, A REQUEST THAT
DEPARTMENTAL PREFECT (GOVERNOR) JACOBO MISHKIN HAS DEEMED
"IMPOSSIBLE."

   "IF THERE IS NO TRANSPORTATION, THE PEOPLE WILL WALK," PRESIDENT
ALAN GARCIA HAS SAID, REAFFIRMING HIS "ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE" THAT THE
PERUVIAN PEOPLE WILL VOTE EN MASSE -- DESPITE THE TERRORIST THREATS --
TO "STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY," RECOVERED IN 1980 AFTER 12 YEARS OF
MILITARY GOVERNMENTS.  PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, NATIONAL ELECTION BOARD
PRESIDENT CARLOS CASTANEDA, AND THE CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN URGING THE
NEARLY 10 MILLION VOTERS TO COMPLY WITH THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY BY
CASTING THEIR VOTES.

   THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT A LARGE TURNOUT WILL AMOUNT TO "THE MOST
EFFECTIVE REJECTION OF SUBVERSION" AND THAT IT WILL "STRENGTHEN
DEMOCRACY" IN PERU, WHICH HAS ALMOST 22 MILLION INHABITANTS.

   OUT OF THE NINE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, FOUR HAVE THE BEST
CHANCES, ALTHOUGH ONLY THE CANDIDATE OF THE CENTER RIGHT, MARIO VARGAS
LLOSA, IS THE CLEAR-CUT FAVORITE.  HE WILL GET AN ESTIMATED 45 PERCENT
OF THE VOTES, ACCORDING TO THE LATEST SURVEYS.

   ACCORDING TO PERUVIAN LAW, IF VARGAS LLOSA DOES NOT GET ABSOLUTE
MAJORITY HE WILL HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN A RUNOFF ELECTION WITH THE
SECOND-PLACE CANDIDATE.  SINCE IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT VARGAS LLOSA,
THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FREDEMO), WILL WIN
THE FIRST ROUND, THE QUESTION NOW IS WHO WILL BE HIS RIVAL FOR THE
PRESIDENCY IN THE SECOND ROUND.  ACCORDING TO THE SURVEYS, THE
CANDIDATES WITH THE BEST CHANCE ARE LUIS ALVA CASTRO OF THE RULING
AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA), WITH 19 PERCENT OF THE
VOTES; ALFONSO BARRANTES LINGAN OF THE SOCIALIST LEFT (IS), WITH 12
PERCENT; AND HENRY PEASE OF THE COMMUNIST LEFT WING COALITION UNITED
LEFT (IU), WITH 8 PERCENT.

   DURING THE LAST FIVE DAYS OF THEIR CAMPAIGNS THE CANDIDATES WILL
STEP UP THEIR TRIPS TO VARIOUS POINTS OF THE COUNTRY TRYING TO GAIN
THE VOTES OF A LARGE UNDECIDED SECTOR OF THE POPULATION.  ACCORDING TO
THE SURVEYS, THIS SECTOR REPRESENTS BETWEEN 18 AND 20 PERCENT OF THE
VOTES.

   MEANWHILE THE TERRORISTS CONTINUE ON THEIR PATH OF DEATH AND
DESTRUCTION. IN THE LAST 24 HOURS THE SHINING PATH MURDERED TWO STATE
OFFICIALS OF THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] ON A ROAD LINKING CHAVIN AND
HUARI, TWO TOWNS IN ANCASH DEPARTMENT.  IN HUARAZ, THE CAPITAL OF
ANCASH DEPARTMENT, THE TERRORISTS SET FIRE TO THE OFFICES OF THE LOCAL
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION BUT INJURED NO ONE.  ONE PERSON DIED WHEN AN
ORE TRAIN WAS DERAILED NEAR OROYA, A KEY MINING TOWN IN THE PERUVIAN
CENTRAL JUNGLE AREA, WHERE AN ELECTORAL REGISTRATION OFFICE WAS
LOCATED.  SEVEN PRIVATE BANK BRANCHES WERE ALSO ATTACKED AND SERIOUSLY
DAMAGED IN LIMA. IN BARRANCA, A SMALL VILLAGE 180 KM FROM LIMA,
TERRORISTS BOMBED A RADIO STATION AND A DRUGSTORE, BOTH OF THEM
BELONGING TO SANTIAGO JAO, A FREDEMO CANDIDATE FOR DEPUTY.
