   SAN SALVADOR, 12 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES DENIED TODAY THAT THEIR PLANES HAD BOMBED A REFUGEE CAMP AND
CIVILIAN SETTLEMENTS IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF CHALATENANGO AND MORAZAN,
LOCATED NORTH AND NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR, AS RELIGIOUS SOURCES HAD
REPORTED YESTERDAY.

   A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED BY THE ARMED FORCES STATES THAT FIVE PERSONS,
INCLUDING FOUR MINORS, WERE KILLED, NOT AS A RESULT OF THE BOMBINGS,
"BUT AS A RESULT OF THE CLASHES" BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS AT
THE "CORRAL DE LAS PIEDRAS" REFUGEE CAMP IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.

   THE ARMED FORCES ACCUSED THE GUERRILLAS OF FIRING ROCKETS "THAT HIT
SEVERAL HOUSES," AND IT REPORTED THAT A SOLDIER AND SIX GUERRILLAS
WERE KILLED IN THE CLASHES, WHICH LASTED BETWEEN 0600 AND 1400.

   HOWEVER, EDUARDO ALAS, THE BISHOP OF CHALATENANGO, TOLD THE MEDIA
TODAY THAT FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND AT LEAST 14 CIVILIANS WERE
WOUNDED WHEN THE CAMP WAS ATTACKED FROM THE AIR.

   "ACCORDING TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY," ALAS SAID, "A ROCKET OR A
GRENADE-TYPE DEVICE FELL ON ONE OF THE HOUSES WITH MANY PEOPLE INSIDE,
INCLUDING CHILDREN.  I SAW THE MUTILATED BODIES OF THE CHILDREN AND
HOLES IN THE ROOF.  THERE WAS A LOT OF MACHINEGUN FIRE."

   MOREOVER, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)
CONDEMNED THE "COWARDLY ATTACK" ON THE REFUGEE HOMES, WHICH, HE SAID,
WERE "HIGLY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIED AS CIVILIAN HOUSING."

   "THIS INCIDENT SHOWS A TOTAL LACK OF COMMITMENT BY THE ARMED FORCES
TO REACH A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION, AND IT REAFFIRMS THE NEED TO MAINTAIN
THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND TO USE MILITARY POWER TO REACH A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED," THE FMLN SAID IN A
COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY.

   THE FMLN ALSO CONDEMNED AN ALLEGED BOMBING OF THE TOWN OF
CACAOPERA, IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT, WHICH THE ARMED FORCES HAVE DENIED.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, A WOMAN WAS WOUNDED AND A SUGAR CANE
HARVEST WAS DESTROYED BY THE BOMBS, BUT ACCORDING TO COL MAURICIO
VARGAS, MILITARY CHIEF OF THE REGION, "THERE WAS NO BOMBING, BUT
CLASHES WITH A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS WITH THE SUPPORT OF HELICOPTERS."

   THE MILITARY CHIEF PROMISED, HOWEVER, TO CARRY OUT THE "PERTINENT
INVESTIGATIONS TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE REGION."

   BOGOTA, 13 FEB 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] THE NATIONAL POLICE'S
DIJIN [DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS] HAS REVEALED A
TERRORIST PLAN THAT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY, ELN, WAS PLANNING TO CARRY
OUT IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN COLOMBIA IN MARCH, AND ADDED THAT THIS
SUBVERSIVE GROUP IS DIVIDED BY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ITS LEADERS.

   A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THIS SECURITY ORGANIZATION STATES THAT,
FOLLOWING AN EXHAUSTIVE INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED
THAT THIS GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IS DIVIDED, BECAUSE AN ELN FACTION
REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE DECISIONS OF FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ
MARTINEZ.

   IT ALSO STATES THAT THE DISSIDENT GROUP HAS ACCUSED THE FORMER
SPANISH CLERGYMAN AND TOP ELN LEADER OF MONOPOLIZING ECONOMIC
RESOURCES, PREVENTING THE MODERNIZATION OF THE RANK AND FILE,
MAINTAINING A SECURITY GROUP MADE UP OF CRIMINALS, ASSUMING
PATERNALISTIC ATTITUDES, AND USING THE MARXIST IDEOLOGY FOR HIS OWN
BENEFIT.

   THE REPORT ALSO REVEALED THAT THE INSURGENT ORGANIZATION WAS
PLANNING TO CARRY OUT A SO-CALLED KEY OPERATION IN NORTHERN AND
EASTERN COLOMBIA THAT WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE KIDNAPPING OF
PERSONALITIES, THE OCCUPATION OF TOWNS, AND THE ASSASSINATION OF TOP
ARMED FORCES OFFICERS.

   MEANWHILE, TROOPS OF THE NATIONAL ARMY'S 5TH BRIGADE HAVE
INTENSIFIED SEARCH AND CONTROL OPERATIONS IN A RURAL AREA OF SAN
VICENTE DE CHUCURI MUNICIPALITY, MIDDLE MAGDALENA, SANTANDER
DEPARTMENT, AFTER KILLING SIX ELN SUBVERSIVES AND SEIZING ABUNDANT WAR
MATERIEL.

   ACCORDING TO THE DEFENSE MINISTRY'S ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT, THERE
WAS A CLASH BETWEEN UNITS OF THE (LUCIANO DE LUGER) BATTALION AND
GUERRILLAS OF THE ELN'S CAPTAIN PARMENIO FRONT IN LA TEMPESTUOSA PATH,
SAN VICENTE DE CHUCURI MUNICIPALITY, SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.  SIX
UNIDENTIFIED INSURGENTS WERE KILLED AND WEAPONS OF VARIOUS CALIBERS,
AMMUNITION, UNIFORMS, DOCUMENTS, AND SUBVERSIVE PROPAGANDA WERE
SEIZED.

   MEMBERS OF THE 5TH BRIGADE ARE PATROLLING VARIOUS MUNICIPALITIES OF
SANTANDER DEPARTMENT TO GUARANTEE NORMAL ELECTIONS AND ACTIVITIES OF
THE NATIONAL CIVIL REGISTRY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 FEB 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
HAS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED ITS REGRET OVER THE DEATH OF SEVERAL CHILDREN
AND CIVILIANS IN THE GUANCORITA CANTON, CHALANTENGO DEPARTMENT, ON 11
FEBRUARY, AND HAS ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION TO CLARIFY THE CASE, WHICH
IS BEING BLAMED ON THE AIR FORCE.  THE MASSACRE TOOK PLACE AT A CAMP
OF SALVADORAN REFUGEES WHO HAD BEEN IN HONDURAS.  ACCORDING TO
RESIDENTS, SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS STRAFED THE CAMP FOLLOWING
A CLASH BETWEEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS AND GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT.

   MEANWHILE, AIR FORCE COMMANDER GENERAL RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA DENIED
THE ACCUSATIONS BUT ADMITTED SOLDIERS BELONGING TO A DETACHMENT
STATIONED IN CHALANTENANGO HAD RECEIVED AIR SUPPORT. "THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE AIR FORCE IS EFFECTED ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS,
WHICH IS WHY IT COULD NOT HAVE BOMBED CIVILIANS," VILLAMARIONA SAID.

   IN THE WAKE OF THIS GRAVE INCIDENT, CHALANTENANGO DIOCESE BISHOP
MSGR. EDUARDO ALAS HELPED TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE WOUNDED AND HEARD
TESTIMONIES FROM RESIDENTS.  THEY SAID THAT THE HELICOPTERS HAD
DROPPED "ROCKETS," ACCORDING TO THE BISHOP.

   ON MONDAY, MILITARY SOURCES CONFIRMED HEAVY FIGHTING HAD TAKEN
PLACE IN THE AREA KNOWN AS CORRAL DE PIEDRA, GUANCORITA CANTON, SOME
80 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, AND THAT SEVERAL CIVILIANS WERE KILLED
AND AT LEAST 15 WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE FIGHTING.  MASS GROUPS HAVE
DEMANDED PUNISHMENT FOR THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE, SINCE THE VICTIMS,
MOST OF THEM MINORS, WERE REPATRIATES FROM HONDURAS WHO HAD SETTLED
BETWEEN GUARJILA AND SAN JOSE LAS FLORES, WHICH IS WHERE THEY HAD COME
FROM.

   THE ARMY STATES THAT IT ALSO CAPTURED A REBEL IDENTIFIED AS ABEL
DUBON CHEVARRIA, WHO ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL REPORT DISCLOSED THAT
THE REBELS HAD USED THEIR CATAPULTS AGAINST THE HOUSES IN THE TOWN.
HOWEVER, THE AREA RESIDENTS DENY THIS REPORT.

   CARTAGENA, 14 FEB 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA
MARQUEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE, TODAY SAID IN
CARTAGENA DE INDIAS THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THE "EXTRADITABLES," A
GROUP THAT REPRESENTS THE LARGEST GROUP OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN THE
COUNTRY, ARE WILLING, AS THEY HAVE CLAIMED, TO ACHIEVE PEACE.

   MAZA MARQUEZ, WHO ARRIVED IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS ALONG WITH
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO -- THE HOST OF THE DRUG "SUMMIT" THAT WILL BE
HELD IN THIS CITY ON COLOMBIA'S CARIBBEAN COAST -- ADDED THAT THE
PARTIAL TURNOVERS THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE MADE OF RAW MATERIALS
AND WEAPONS IN RECENT WEEKS "PROVE VERY LITTLE."

   ACCORDING TO THE COLOMBIAN GENERAL, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS "TURN OVER
ONE TON (OF DYNAMITE) BUT THEY HIDE SEVEN TONS."

   THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS),
THE SECRET POLICE AT THE SERVICE OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, MADE THIS
STATEMENT IN REGARD TO THE VOLUNTARY TURNOVERS MADE BY THE MEDELLIN
CARTEL, THE LARGEST COCAINE-EXPORTING GROUP IN THE WORLD.

   THE "EXTRADITABLES" BEGAN THEIR TURNOVERS DURING THE LAST WEEK OF
JANUARY, AFTER ANNOUNCING THEIR SURRENDER TO THE STATE, AS PROOF OF
THEIR "GOOD WILL" -- TO EARN THEM "LESS STRICT TREATMENT" BY COLOMBIAN
SOCIETY.

   TODAY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS "DELIVERED" THREE LABORATORIES, WITH A
CAPACITY FOR PROCESSING 20,000 KG PER MONTH, TO 25 COLOMBIAN
JOURNALISTS.

   THE FACILITIES, LOCATED IN THE CHOCO JUNGLE REGION ON THE
PANAMANIAN BORDER IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA, HAVE BEEN TERMED BY THE
JOURNALISTS AS "THE BIGGEST" LABS AVAILABLE TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE TURNOVER WAS MINIMIZED BY THE DAS DIRECTOR, WHO
SAID THAT THESE PRODUCTION CENTERS "HAVE NOT BEEN USED FOR A LONG
TIME."

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE PRIOR TO THE MEETING BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENTS OF BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, THE UNITED STATES, AND PERU, MIGUEL
MAZA MARQUEZ EMPHASIZED TODAY THAT THE COLOMBIAN STATE'S "GOAL" IS
STILL "TO CAPTURE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND TURN THEM OVER TO COLOMBIAN
JUSTICE."

   THE CHIEF OF THE SECRET POLICE INSISTED THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO
INDICATE THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING A DIALOGUE OR REACHING
AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NARCO-TERRORISTS.

   THE ANTI-DRUG SUMMIT WILL BE HELD TOMORROW IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS
WITH THE INTENTION OF COORDINATING JOINT POLICIES TO END THE
PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, AND EXPORT OF COCA LEAVES AND COCAINE IN LATIN
AMERICA.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL LAST ONLY FOUR HOURS, AND IT WILL
CONCLUDE WITH THE SIGNING OF A DOCUMENT THAT, JUDGING FROM THE DRAFT,
WILL STRENGTHEN MULTILATERAL RELATIONS TO COUNTER THE PRODUCTION,
EXPORT, AND CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.

- ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (UC-ELN), THE MOST BELLIGERENT IN
COLOMBIA, TODAY REPUDIATED U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S VISIT IN THE
COUNTRY AND WARNED THAT "WE WILL BE IN CARTAGENA."

   THE GUERRILLA GROUP'S "COMMUNIQUE NO. 1" ON "OPERATION COLOMBIA"
WAS SENT TO EFE AND IT SAID THAT "IN REPUDIATION OF MR. BUSH'S
PRESENCE IN CARTAGENA, WE ARE GOING FORWARD OPERATION COLOMBIA."  "THE
MANDELA COMMANDOS" HAVE BEEN CREATED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

   ADDRESSING THE COLOMBIANS, "THE PEOPLE OF PERU AND BOLIVIA, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA," THE UC-ELN SAID: "WE CONSIDER THE U.S.
PRESIDENT'S VISIT A MOCKERY TO COLOMBIA'S DIGNITY AND SOVEREIGNTY."

   WITHOUT IDENTIFYING THEM, IT ANNOUNCES THAT THE "NELSON MANDELA
COMMANDOS OF OUR ORGANIZATION HAVE SEIZED U.S. CITIZENS AND LATER WE
WILL LATER REVEAL THE CONDITIONS FOR THEIR RELEASE."

   AS OF TODAY, THE ONLY INFORMATION AVAILABLE IS ON KIDNAPPING VICTIM
U.S. PROFESSOR DAVID LESLIE KENT.  KENT WAS KIDNAPPED ON 13 FEBRUARY

   ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE KIDNAPPING,
IT COULD BE PART OF THE "OPERATION COLOMBIA," ANNOUNCED BY THE
PRO-CASTRIST ARMY OF NATIONAL LILBERATION, CAMILIST UNION GUERRRILLA
GROUP (UC-ELN) IN PROTEST FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S VISIT TO

   LONDON (UK), 15 FEB 90 (LONDON PRESS ASSOCIATION) -- [ARTICLE] [TOM
MCMULLAN, PRESS ASSOCIATION DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT] [TEXT] BRITAIN
AND ARGENTINA TONIGHT AGREED TO RESUME FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WHICH
WERE BROKEN OFF IN 1982 AFTER THE INVASION OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS.
THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE TONIGHT IN LONDON, BUENOS AIRES AND MADRID,
WHERE TWO DAYS OF TALKS BETWEEN SENIOR OFFICIALS HAVE HAMMERED OUT THE
DEAL.  THE FOREIGN OFFICE STRESSED THE DECISION WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT
ON BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY OF THE FALKLANDS, WHERE 1,000 BRITONS WERE
KILLED AND WOUNDED DURING THE WAR.

   BRITAIN HAS AGREED TO LIFT THE 150-MILE MILITARY PROTECTION ZONE
AROUND THE FALKLANDS FROM MARCH 31.  AT THE SAME TIME NEW MUTUALLY
AGREED SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WILL COME INTO FORCE.  THESE WILL INVOLVE
25 DAYS ADVANCE NOTIFICATION BY EACH SIDE OF MILITARY MANOEUVRES IN
CERTAIN AREAS.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN AGREED THERE SHOULD BE 48-HOURS
NOTICE FOR NAVAL SHIPS WHICH WANT TO APPROACH CLOSER TO THE COAST THAN
50 NAUTICAL MILES AND 70 NAUTICAL MILES FOR AIRCRAFT.

   FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WILL COME INTO FORCE AS SOON AS THE
PROTECTING POWERS FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED.  BRITAIN'S
INTERESTS IN ARGENTINA HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED BY SWITZERLAND SINCE
1982.  ARGENTINA'S INTERESTS IN LONDON HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED BY BRAZIL
FROM THE SAME PERIOD.

   TALKS ON FISHERIES AROUND THE FALKLANDS WILL CONTINUE.  A WORKING
GROUP ON SOUTH ATLANTIC AFFAIRS IS TO BE SET UP.  ITS FIRST MEETING
WILL TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  AN ARGENTINE VISIT TO WAR
CEMETERIES IN THE FALKLANDS WILL BE ALLOWED TO GO AHEAD.  THIS WILL BE
WORKED OUT THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS.

   BOTH SIDES HAVE ALSO AGREED THAT VISAS REQUIREMENTS WILL BE
ABOLISHED.  BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA HAVE ALSO AGREED TO COOPERATE ON
DRUGS AND THE ENVIRONMENT.

   THE BRITISH DELEGATION TO THE TALKS WAS LED BY SIR CRISPIN TICKELL,
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE ARGENTINE DELEGATION BY SENOR
GARCIA DEL SOLAR, SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM.

   THE AGREEMENT IS THE OUTCOME OF A SERIES OF CONTACTS BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  IN OCTOBER, IT WAS AGREED TO
ESTABLISH CONSULAR RELATIONS.  AIR LINKS BETWEEN BUENOS AIRES AND
LONDON RESUMED A FEW WEEKS AGO.  A PARTY OF BRITISH MPS AND PROMINENT
PUBLIC FIGURES HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM BUENOS AIRES AFTER THE
INAUGURAL FLIGHT BY BRITISH AIRWAYS.  AN OBSTACLE TO THE RESUMPTION OF
RELATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WAS THE ARGENTINE REFUSAL TO DECLARE
THAT HOSTILITIES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE AT AN END.  HOWEVER,
THE NEWLY-ELECTED ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT MADE CLEAR LAST YEAR THAT SUCH
HOSTILITIES COULD NOW BE CONSIDERED AT AN END.  BRITAIN, AFTER TALKS
LAST OCTOBER, AGREED TO RAISE NO OBSTACLES TO ARGENTINE EFFORTS TO
ESTABLISH CLOSER TRADING RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.  THE
ARGENTINE ECONOMY IS NOW SEEN TO BE IN A SEVERE PLIGHT.  PRESIDENT
MENEM HAS WATCHED HIS POPULARITY DECLINE AS ARGENTINA INFLATION HAS
REMAINED AT A HIGH LEVEL.

   BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA WILL ALSO ESTABLISH A DIRECT COMMUNICATION
LINK BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE MILITARY AUTHORITIES.  THE PURPOSE IS TO
REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF INCIDENTS AND TO LIMIT THEIR CONSEQUENCES IF
SUCH INCIDENTS SHOULD OCCUR.  ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT, THIS HOTLINE
WILL INCREASE COMMON KNOWLEDGE OF MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH
ATLANTIC.  THE LINK WILL BE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE ARGENTINE AND
BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTRIES.  BRITISH MINISTERS HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT
ADEQUATE DEFENCE ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THE FALKLANDS.

   FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER TIMOTHY SAINSBURY RETURNED TO LONDON LAST
WEEKEND AFTER A VISIT TO THE FALKLANDS WHERE HE REASSURED ISLANDERS
THERE WAS NO WEAKENING IN BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT TO THEIR DEFENCE.

   FOREIGN SECRETARY DOUGLAS HURD TONIGHT DESCRIBED THE AGREEMENT WITH
ARGENTINA AS "VERY SATISFACTORY" AND THAT IT "UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT
WE HAVE NO QUARREL WITH ARGENTINA".  HE SAID: "THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED
WITHOUT ANY SACRIFICE OF SOVEREIGNTY.  I HOPE IT IS A TURNING POINT
THAT WILL LEAD TO A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA."
MR HURD TOLD REPORTERS AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE: "I HOPE THAT TRADE
BETWEEN BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA CAN BE ACCELERATED.  IT IS FOR THE
FALKLAND ISLANDERS TO DECIDE ON THEIR OWN CONTACTS WITH THE MAINLAND."

   ASKED IF THE INSTABILITY IN ARGENTINA MIGHT LEAD TO A NEW ATTEMPT
TO SEIZE THE FALKLANDS, HE SAID: "I THINK THAT IS BECOMING LESS AND
LESS LIKELY."  HE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION THAT THE READINESS OF THE
GOVERNMENT IN ARGENTINA TO MAKE THIS ADVANCE WHICH BRITAIN HAD
RECIPROCATED.  "THE OUTCOME IS VERY SATISFACTORY," HE SAID.  THE
BRITISH PROTECTION ZONE HAD BEEN REPLACED "WITH SOMETHING FROM A
SECURITY POINT OF VIEW THAT IS BETTER.  WE HAVE REPLACED IT WITH AN
ADVANCE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM ON THE APPROACH OF SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT.
THAT FROM A SECURITY VIEWPOINT IS AN IMPROVEMENT."  HE HOPED THAT THE
AGREEMENT WOULD BE WELL RECEIVED IN THE FALKLANDS AND NOTED THAT THE
FALKLAND ISLANDERS HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN AN ASSURANCE OF BRITAIN'S
CONTINUED COMMITMENT.

   THE EXCHANGE OF AMBASSADORS AND THE ENDING OF VISAS WOULD TAKE
PLACE QUITE SOON.

   ASKED IF SOVEREIGNTY OF THE FALKLANDS COULD EVER BE DISCUSSED WITH
ARGENTINA HE SAID: "I DO NOT SEE HOW THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED BY US GIVEN
THE HISTORY AND PRINCIPLE THAT IS INVOLVED."

   LABOUR WELCOMED THE MOVE TO RESUME FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  MR
GEORGE FOULKES, A FRONT BENCH SPOKESMAN ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SAID IT
MEANT THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE NOW ALMOST BACK TO THEIR RESPECTIVE
POSITIONS BEFORE THE 1982 CONFLICT.  BUT HE ADDED: "WE MUST NOW PULL
OUT ALL THE STOPS IN DEVELOPING TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO
COUNTRIES."  THIS INCLUDED CONSIDERING ALL OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRITISH
INVESTMENT IN ARGENTINA AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL, SPORTING AND
OTHER LINKS.

   LA PAZ, 9 FEB 90 (PRESENCIA) -- [ARTICLE] [GREGORIO LANZA] [TEXT]
THE SANTA CRUZ PREPARATORY MEETING WAS HELD UNDER STRICT SECURITY
MEASURES AND ITS CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN KEPT UNDER STRICT SECRECY.
THIS VEIL OF SECRECY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN LIFTED WHEN THE MORNING
NEWSPAPER HOY PUBLISHED A LONG AGENDA UNDER THE HEADING "TOTAL WAR
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING."  THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAS NEITHER
CONFIRMED NOR REJECTED THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE REPORT.  (SILENCE IS
GOLDEN).  AT A MEETING AT THE INTERIOR MINISTER'S OFFICE ON 31
JANUARY, THE MINISTER TOLD COCA PRODUCERS THAT HOY DID NOT REPORT THE
PRELIMINARY AGENDA...  AND THAT THE PRESIDENT'S CRITERION OF "COCA IN
RETURN FOR DEVELOPMENT" HAS PREVAILED.  IF THIS IS THE CASE, AND IF
THERE IS CONSENSUS ON THIS POSITION, WHY HASN'T THE COUNTRY BEEN
INFORMED?

   THE SITUATION HAS BEEN FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE REMARKS BY
PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, WHO SAID THAT "WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED
TO HAVE BEEN AGREED UPON" ONE OF THE COUNTRIES INTRODUCED CHANGES THAT
HAVE "CHANGED THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE ISSUE."  WHAT IS THIS NEW
CONCEPT?  IS IT ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY OR INDEPENDENCE?

   THE PROGOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA HAS MONOTONOUSLY REITERATED OVER THE
PAST FEW DAYS THAT TO GOVERN MEANS TO INFORM.  FINE.  WE AGREE THAT TO
INFORM IS PART OF THE ART OF GOVERNING.  TO INFORM, HOWEVER, ALSO
MEANS TO TELL THE TRUTH, ESPECIALLY IF IT DEALS WITH AN ISSUE THAT IS
FUNDAMENTAL TO THE FUTURE OF BOLIVIANS.  THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE
CONSISTENT, AT LEAST WITH THIS PRINCIPLE.

   PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA HAS REPEATEDLY PROPOSED THE REPLACEMENT
OF COCA PRODUCTION THROUGH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.  YET THE REMARKS BY
U.S. EMBASSY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION MARILYN MCAFEE HAVE DEALT AN
ANTICIPATED BLOW THAT HAS CAUSED SOME OFFICIALS TO HESITATE.  "THERE
IS $15 MILLION FOR REPLACEMENT," SHE SAID.  (THERE IS $60 MILLION FOR
REPRESSION).  BARELY RECUPERATED FROM HIS SURPRISE, THE FOREIGN
MINISTER SAID THAT THE U.S. HELP IS A "BILATERAL ISSUE AND,
CONSEQUENTLY, IT WILL NOT BE DIRECTLY ADDRESSED" AT THE CARTAGENA
SUMMIT.  THE INTERIOR MINISTER, WHO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN THIS TYPE
OF SITUATION, DID NOT ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO MCAFEE'S STATEMENT AND
STRESSED THAT "MORE EXACT FIGURES WILL BE MENTIONED AT THE CARTAGENA
SUMMIT."  WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH?  WILL THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT ADDRESS
THE ECONOMIC AID?

   AFTER THIS PECULIAR SITUATION, THE UNITED STATES SEEMS TO HAVE
CHOSEN INTERDICTION AND ERADICATION -- REPRESSION -- TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  THE STRATEGY OF "WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING
TERRORISTS" HAS PREVAILED.  THIS STRATEGY LENDS ITSELF TO
INTERVENTIONIST MILITARY POLICIES, SIMILAR TO THE PRESENCE OF U.S.
MARINES IN BOLIVIA IN THE PAST, OR, IN THE FUTURE, THE CREATION OF A
MULTINATIONAL MILITARY FORCE THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE REGIONAL POLITICAL
AND MILITARY STABILITY.

   WHEN THE TRAFFICKING OF COCAINE WAS CARRIED OUT AS A COVERT
OPERATION (1984-87) INVOLVING THE CIA AND THE U.S. ARMY -- FOR THE
PURPOSE OF PROVIDING MILITARY SUPPLIES TO THE CONTRAS -- COCAINE
TRAFFICKING WAS NOT A CRIME.  THE LINKS BETWEEN NORIEGA AND DRUG
TRAFFICKING WERE A MATTER OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE AS LONG AS HE
PROVIDED INFORMATION AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR WAR AGAINST NICARAGUA.  BUT
NOW THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT MIND INVADING PANAMA OR TURNING
COLOMBIA INTO AN INFERNO TO CAPTURE NORIEGA OR SOME OF THE MAJOR
COLOMBIAN TRAFFICKERS ON THIS CRUSADE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THAT
IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S DOUBLE-FACED MORALITY.

   ANOTHER SCANDAL HIT U.S. SOCIETY LAST WEEK.  MARION BARRY, THE
MAYOR OF WASHINGTON, THE CAPITAL OF THE EMPIRE AND ALSO THE CAPITAL OF
CRIME, WAS CAUGHT IN AN FBI TRAP.  HE WAS FILMED CONSUMING COCAINE.
HIS FOLLOWERS CLAIM THAT IT IS A WHITE CONSPIRACY TO PREVENT A BLACK
MAYOR FROM RUNNING FOR ANOTHER TERM.

   BUT THE INTERESTING POINT FOR US IS THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN
BENNETT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT STRATEGIST FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING (THE BENNETT PLAN), AND WASHINGTON POLICE CHIEF FULWOOD.
WHILE BENNETT HAS QUESTIONED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WASHINGTON POLICE,
CLAIMING THAT THIS AREA RECEIVES THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF FEDERAL SUPPORT
FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, FULWOOD HAS SAID THAT
BENNETT IS WASTING TIME "TALKING WITHOUT DOING ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING"
(NEWSWEEK, 29 JANUARY).  THE NEWSWEEK JOURNALIST SAID THAT EVEN BEFORE
THE BARRY SCANDAL IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT THE BENNETT PLAN HAD
BECOME "ONLY A DIRTY BATTLE OF WORDS."  BENNETT'S STRATEGY FOR THE
PREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN
A TOTAL FAILURE.  BENNETT THEREFORE BELIEVES THAT THE BEST WAY TO
COVER HIS FAILURE IS TO TURN TOWARD LATIN AMERICA TO RELIEVE THE FURY
OF HIS IMPOTENCE, ORDERING WARSHIPS AND PLANES TO CONTROL MARITIME AND
AIR TRAFFIC.  AS USUAL, THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THE "BACKYARD" HAVE TO
PAY FOR THE MISTAKES OF U.S. POLICY.

   THIS IS NOT A STORY OF SUSPENSE.  THE SUSPENSE HAS BEEN CREATED BY
THE ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO KNOW THE
CONCLUSIONS OF THE SANTA CRUZ SUMMIT.  OTHERWISE WE WILL HAVE TO
ACCEPT THAT A SMOKE SCREEN HAS BEEN DEPLOYED OVER THE CARTAGENA
SUMMIT.

DEBT AND ITS INTEREST HAVE STEADILY GROWN, BUT THE VALUE OF OUR
PRODUCTION HAS DECREASED, SO IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
PAY THE DEBT.  THEREFORE, WE ARE FACED WITH THE SAME OLD STORY: LEND
ME 100 MILLION AND I WILL PAY YOU 110 MILLION AND STILL OWE YOU 120
MILLION WITH THE NEW INTEREST.  THIS ROTATION OF CREDIT DOES NOT
PRODUCE ANY MATERIAL ASSETS LIKE RAW MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLY PLANTS DID

   I THINK THAT IS UNJUST AND SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AS A WHOLE.  THE
UNITED STATES HAS... CHANGES THOUGHT WHAT MORE DOES IT WANT, IF IT HAS
THE RESOURCES THAT IT NO LONGER SPENDS ON ATOMIC BOMBS OR ON MEN AND
WEAPONS IN EUROPE?  IT HAS TO INVEST THOSE RESOURCES SO THAT THEY MAY
YIELD SOMETHING.  WHERE?  IN POLAND?  IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA?  WHY?  WHY
NOT IN LATIN AMERICA?  WE ARE HERE AND WE HAVE COMMON PROBLEMS LIKE
DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS.

   [AMAT] WHAT ARE PERU'S REVENUES, IN DOLLARS, FOR THE COCA CROPS?

   [GARCIA] THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IS APPROXIMATELY $700
MILLION.

   [AMAT] WITH WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO REPLACE THAT $700 MILLION IF THE
COCA CROPS ARE ABOLISHED?

   [GARCIA] THAT IS THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT IS WHY WE CAME TO
TALK.  IT IS OBVIOUS, IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE AN ETHICAL AND MORAL
OBLIGATION TO END IT, BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT I HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE
PEASANTS' COCA CROPS TO ACHIEVE THIS.

   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT ABOUT THE PEASANTS OF PERU AND BOLIVIA?
COLOMBIA'S CASE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE COCA IS PROCESSED HERE.  WOULD
THE PEASANTS BE WILLING TO CHANGE THOSE CROPS FOR OTHERS?

   [GARCIA] IF THEY ARE GIVEN A LONG-TERM GUARANTEE, YES.

   [AMAT] BUT WOULD THEY CHANGE COCA FOR TOMATOES, ORANGES, AND CACAO?

   [GARCIA] IT IS NOT EASY TO CHANGE IT FOR COFFEE, TOBACCO, CACAO,
ANNATTO, OR PALM TREES.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS STUDIED ALL THIS.
I HAVE A 600-PAGE REPORT FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT DISCUSSES THE
ALTERNATIVES FOR REPLACING THE 80,000 HECTARES IN THE GUAYAGA VALLEY
-- WHICH IS THE LARGEST COCA-PRODUCING AREA IN THE COUNTRY.  IT
WOULD COST $600 MILLION TO INDUSTRIALIZE THE AREA ON A LONG-TERM
BASIS.

   [AMAT] BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, COCA PRACTICALLY GROWS WILD; IT DOES NOT
REQUIRE MUCH WORK IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.  HOW CAN A GOVERNMENT LIKE YOURS
CONVINCE A FARMER TO INVEST MUCH MORE MONEY IN A PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE
MUCH LESS PROFITABLE?

   [REPORTER] LET ME ADD SOMETHING TO THAT...

   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] EXCUSE ME.  IT IS A VICIOUS CIRCLE.  THE
PEASANT PRODUCES COCA BECAUSE HE HAS NO MONEY.  I WILL NOT ASK HIM TO
INVEST MONEY HE DOES NOT HAVE TO CHANGE THE PRODUCT.  THE UNITED
STATES HAS TO BUY THE NEW PRODUCT TO ACHIEVE THIS.  THE UNITED STATES
HAS TO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL BUY THE PRODUCT.  LOOK, HOW MANY
TRILLIONS DOES THE UNITED STATES BUY AS IMPORTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES? A
FRACTION OF THIS WOULD CHANGE THE DESTINY OF COLOMBIA, PERU, AND
BOLIVIA.

   THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SAY: IF I BUY $600 BILLION IN PRODUCTS
ABROAD, I WILL BUY $10 BILLION -- OF ANYTHING -- IN PERU, COLOMBIA,
AND BOLIVIA.  IT COULD BE TOMATOES, PALM OIL, COFFEE, CHOCOLATE BARS,
ANYTHING.  THIS WOULD CHANGE THE HISTORY OF THESE COUNTRIES.  [CONTINUED]

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA
BY AMAT AND AN UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [GARCIA] I
HAVE SPENT THE LAST SIX YEARS OF MY POLITICAL LIFE SAYING THINGS
CLEARLY.  MANY PEOPLE DESCRIBE THAT ATTITUDE AS VEHEMENCE OR
RADICALISM.  I DISAGREE WITH THAT VIEW.

   WHEN THE UNITED STATES INVADED PANAMA -- AND I WAS AWARE OF WHAT
NORIEGA WAS -- I SAID THAT DESPITE THAT FACT, THE INVASION HAD BEEN A
CRIME.  WE DEMANDED THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.S. TROOPS.  I
SAID THAT IF THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL DID NOT TAKE PLACE, I WOULD NOT
ATTEND THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT, BECAUSE I COULD NOT SIT AT THE SAME TABLE
WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENT WHILE A LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY REMAINED
INVADED.  AND IT HAPPENED.  IT HAPPENED.  THE TROOPS HAD TO WITHDRAW.
AND WE HAVE HELD A CORDIAL MEETING FOR THAT REASON.

   [AMAT] MR PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE CONVINCED US [WORDS INDISTINCT]
THINGS THE WAY YOU SEE AND FEEL ABOUT THEM.  WILL YOU TELL US FRANKLY
-- FRANKLY -- WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE SUMMIT?  WHAT HAPPENED AT
THE SUMMIT?  WHAT IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS WERE REACHED AT THE SUMMIT?

   [GARCIA] FRANKLY, AND IN A NUTSHELL, IT WAS POSITIVE.  IT CREATED A
MULTILATERAL ATMOSPHERE, AND WE TALKED VERY CANDIDLY.  AS FOR ME
PERSONALLY, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET A CONTINENTAL POLITICIAN
LIKE BUSH, AND I FOUND HIM TO BE A PRAGMATIC PERSON.  I PROBABLY
DISAGREE WITH HIM ON MORE THAN HALF OF THE THINGS HE THINKS, BUT I DO
NOT THINK THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE OBLIGED TO BE IDENTICAL. WHAT IS
IMPORTANT IS TO LOOK AT EACH PERSON FOR HIS GOOD POINTS -- HOWEVER FEW
OR MANY THEY MAY BE -- TO ESTABLISH A RAPPORT ON THAT BASIS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS BEING PLANNED?  WHAT IS NEXT?  WHAT IS GOING TO
BE DONE TO CONTINUE... [CHANGES THOUGHT] IN ORDER FOR THE PRESIDENTS
TO KEEP IN CONSTANT TOUCH TO FULFILL WHAT THEY SIGNED?

   [GARCIA] WELL, THERE WILL BE CONSTANT COMMUNICATION.  IT IS EASY TO
TALK WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENT, WHO IS NOT GOD.  THERE ARE TELEPHONES TO
DO THAT.  MR. BELL INVENTED A LITTLE GADGET OVER A CENTURY AGO CALLED
THE TELEPHONE AND WE, THE PRESIDENTS, COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER --
WITH BARCO, PAZ ZAMORA, AND PRESIDENT BUSH, TO ASK: WILL WE OR WILL WE
NOT DO WHAT WE PLEDGED TO DO?  IF WE DO NOT, AT LEAST IT WILL NOT BE
MY FAULT OR THAT OF THE LATIN AMERICANS.

   [AMAT] WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN ELECTORAL PROCESS IN COLOMBIA, AND
THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT IS ALSO FACING AN ELECTORAL PROCESS...

   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] AND YOU KNOW THE CANDIDATE, FORTUNATELY.
[CHUCKLES]

   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, IT LOOKS LIKE THE OPPOSITION IS GOING TO
DEFEAT YOU IN YOUR COUNTRY?

   [GARCIA] IT IS A POSSIBILITY, IT IS TRUE.

   [AMAT] WHY?

   [GARCIA] LOOK, ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO YOUR QUESTION WOULD THINK THAT
FIVE YEARS AGO, WHEN I ASSUMED POWER, PERU WAS A COUNTRY FULL OF GOLD,
VERY RICH, THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE THE SPANISH CONQUEST -- ORDERLY, AND
WITHOUT PROBLEMS.  FIVE YEARS AGO IT HAD A DEVELOPED TERRORIST
PROBLEM.  IT HAD A FOREIGN DEBT OF 14.5 BILLION AND WAS EXTREMELY
POOR.  FIVE YEARS HAVE ELAPSED.  I EXPLAINED TO YOU ONCE
 THAT I TRIED TO MAKE IT GROW AT GREAT SPEED AND MANAGED TO DO SO.
THEN WE FACED A DECLINE, AND WE ARE NOW STABILIZING THE SITUATION.

   HOWEVER, MANY PEOPLE FEEL THAT A PERSON CAN SOLVE MANY THINGS
BECAUSE OF THE IMPETUOSITY IN HIS PERSONALITY.  SOMETIMES THIS IS THE
PROBLEM OF BEING HONEST OR HAVING AN IMPETUOUS PERSONALITY OR
HARBORING MANY HOPES -- OR SELLING THEM.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT -- LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO -- WE HAVE A POOR COUNTRY,
A COUNTRY THAT OWES MONEY, A COUNTRY THAT HAS JUST AS MUCH OR MORE
SUBVERSIVE TERRORISM, AND THIS MAKES PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE.  I CANNOT
UNDERSTAND IT.  HOWEVER, THAT IS WHAT WE POLITICIANS ARE FOR -- TO
BURN OUT IN OUR WORK FOR DEMOCRACY TO SURVIVE.  I WILL BE REPLACED BY
SOMEONE ELSE WHO THINKS LIKE ME OR TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ME.  HE WILL
REPLACE ME AND DEMOCRACY WILL STAY, A CIVILIZED SYSTEM. THIS IS THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING.  [CONTINUED]

SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT EARLY THIS MORNING THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, SET ON FIRE TWO COTTON PROCESSING
PLANTS IN SAN MIGUEL, SOME 142 KM EAST OF SAN SALVADOR, CAUSING GREAT
PROPERTY DAMAGE, ACCORDING TO MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SOURCES.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, FMLN MEMBERS ATTACKED THE "CANESSA" AND "EL
OBRAJUELO" COTTON PLANTS IN SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, DESTROYING HEAVY
EQUIPMENT, WAREHOUSES WHERE HUNDREDS OF QUINTALES OF COTTON WERE
STORED, AND THE MAIN BUILDINGS.  FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS HURT.

   SPOKESMEN REPRESENTING THE OWNERS REPORTED MUCH PROPERTY DAMAGE AND
NOTED THAT THE INCIDENT IS PART OF THE FMLN'S CAMPAIGN OF SABOTAGE
AGAINST THE ECONOMY.

   HEAVY CLASHES WERE ALSO REPORTED IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE
COUNTRY'S NORTHEASTERN REGION, DURING WHICH AT LEAST TWO SOLDIERS WERE
KILLED.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE HAS NOT REPORTED

   SEVERAL TOWNS IN EASTERN EL SALVADOR ARE WITHOUT POWER SINCE 14
FEBRUARY DUE TO SABOTAGE ACTIONS.  ELECTRICITY IS ALSO BEING RATIONED
IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF SAN SALVADOR, FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF FIVE
HIGH TENSION LINES, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES.

   HOWEVER, BOMB ATTACKS ON SHOPPING CENTERS IN SAN SALVADOR ARE LESS
FREQUENT.  RECENT ATTACKS HAD CAUSED GREAT CONCERN AND PROMPTED A
STRONG PROTEST FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES OF EL

GEN. HECTOR ALEJANDRO GRAMAJO SPOKE ON 7 FEBRUARY AT A NEWS CONFERENCE JUST
A FEW HOURS AFTER LEARNING OF A NEW GUERRILLA ATTACK THAT TOOK PLACE AT
DAYBREAK ON 7 FEBRUARY, AGAINST THE TECPAN, CHIMALTENANGO POLICE GARRISON.
THE GUERRILLAS STOLE FOUR .38 CALIBER REVOLVERS, FOUR M-1 CARBINES, AND .30
CALIBER AMMUNITION AND TOOK POLICE PATROL CAR NO.  CH-02.

   DURING WEDNESDAY'S NEWS CONFERENCE, THE ARMY RELEASED A SUMMARY OF
GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES STARTING IN EARLY DECEMBER, WHEN SUBVERISVE
COMMANDOS DESTROYED THE BRIDGE SPANNING THE COYOLATE RIVER.  DURING A
FOUR-DAY PERIOD IN DECEMBER, THE GUERRILLAS SABOTAGED AN ELECTRICAL
TOWER OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL AND SET FIRE TO A VEHICLE BELONGING TO THE
TECHNICAL-AGRICULTURAL TRAINING INSTITUTE ON THE ROAD TO SOLOLA.

   TWO MORE ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS TOOK
PLACE THE FIRST WEEK IN JANUARY.  A FEW DAYS LATER, THREE
GOVERNMENT-OWNED VEHICLES WERE SET ON FIRE -- ONE BELONGING TO BANDESA
[NATIONAL AGRICULRURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK] AND TWO BELONGING TO THE
PUBLIC HEALTH MINISTRY, WHICH WERE TRANSPORTING VACCINES TO A CLINIC.
DURING THE LAST DAYS OF JANUARY, THERE WAS ANOTHER ACT OF SABOTAGE
AGAINST THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN QUEZALTENANGO AND AN ATTACK ON THE
VILLAGE OF POCHUTA THAT CAUSED PERSONAL INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE.

   SINCE THE WEEKEND, A POST AT THE KILOMETER 42 ROAD MARK ALONG ROUTE
CA-9 WAS ATTACKED AND A CIVILIAN WAS KILLED.  AT DAYBREAK ON 14
FEBRUARY, THE NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON AT TECPAN, CHIMALTENANGO WAS
ATTACKED, BUT NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED.

   ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE, THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS' NEW
DIRECTIVES CAME FROM A RECENT MEETING HELD IN A CENTRAL AMERICAN
COUNTRY, WHICH THE MILITARY COMMANDER DID NOT IDENTIFY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GRAMAJO] THEY ASK ME [WORDS INDISTINCT]
INTERNATIONALISTS.  WE HAVE CONFIRMED INFORMATION THAT A MEETING WAS
HELD IN ONE OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN OCTOBER 1989.  NORTH
VIETNAMESE ADVISERS -- ONE OF THEM IS NOW A VIETNAMESE GENERAL, BUT
THE MEETING WAS ATTENDED BY VIETNAMESE AND CUBAN GENERALS BASICALLY --
MET WITH SUBVERSIVE LEADERS AND DISCUSSED THE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN AREA UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION THEY ARE SUFFERING.
THUS THEY DECIDED ON A DESPERATE PLAN WHERE THE REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S
WAR WAS GOING TO FOCUS ON TAKING TO ITS OWN AND ONLY COMING TO TOWNS
TO MAKE ITS [WORD INDISTINCT].  EVENTUALLY, THEY WOULD GET THE
POPULATION TO GO AGAINST THE STATE AND THEN TAKE OVER POWER THAT HAS
BEEN ABANDONED.  THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED BECAUSE TIME IS AGAINST THEM;
THE PLAN IS NO LONGER FOR A REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S WAR, BUT BASED ON
PURE TERRORISM BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND ALSO
TO PROMOTE ACTIVITIES WITHIN GUATEMALA, MAINLY RELATED TO THE UPCOMING
ELECTIONS.  [END RECORDING]

IS THE CASE OF THE REBEL ARMED FORCES [FAR] WHO HAVE PENETRATED AREAS
WERE THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS [ORPA]

CENTERS ITS ACTIONS AGAINST BASES.

THE POSSIBILITY OF REINITIATING TALKS WITH GUERRILLA REPRESENTATIVES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GRAMAJO] AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED, WE ONLY REFER TO
THE THREE GROUPS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.  HOWEVER, WE ARE ONLY TALKING

HOWEVER, IS NOT A MATTER THAT CONCERNS US.  WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR IN
THIS SENSE.  WE HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF A

THAT THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT IN COLOMBIA WILL YIELD VERY POSITIVE RESULTS.
THE MAIN COCAINE PRODUCERS (COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU) AND THE
UNITED STATES, WHICH IS THE MAIN CONSUMER, WILL HAVE TO REACH AN
AGREEMENT THAT WILL GIVE US HOPE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ERRADICATE THE
SCOURGE OF DRUGS, WHICH IS KILLING THE YOUTH OF THE CONTINENT."

PERU

   PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA SAYS IN AN INTERVIEW AFTER THE
SUMMIT THAT "I AM SATISFIED WITH THE CONCEPTUAL STATEMENT OF THE
DECLARATION OF CARTAGENA.  I HOPE IT BECOMES REALITY AND THAT THERE IS
SERIOUSNESS IN THE APPROPRIATION OF RESOURCES TO REPLACE AND LIMIT
DRUG TRAFFICKING."

   WHEN ASKED TO SUMMARIZE THE SUMMIT'S RESULTS, HE SAYS: "FRANKLY,
AND IN A NUTSHELL, IT WAS POSITIVE.  IT CREATED A MULTILATERAL
ATMOSPHERE AND WE TALKED VERY CANDIDLY." IN CONCLUSION, HE SAYS THAT
COLOMBIANS "MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH
THE UNITED STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING."

   PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA DURING A VISIT TO SANTA MARTA, COLOMBIA
TO PAY TRIBUTE TO LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR, SAYS THAT THE MEETING IN

   FORMER COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT BELISATIO BETANCUR PARTICIPATED IN A

   DIEGO GARCIA, PRESIDENT OF THE ANDEAN LAWYERS COMMISSION, TERMED
THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT AS "RHETORICAL AND INSUFFICIENT BECAUSE IT WAS
CENTERED ON REPRESSION RATHER THAN STRUCTURAL CHANGES," ADDING THAT
THE AMOUNT PLEDGED BY THE UNITED STATES FOR THE ANTI-DRUG STRUGGLE WAS
"VERY LITTLE."  GARCIA ADDED THAT "THE IDEA IS NOT FOR DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES TO GIVE MONEY" TO LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, BECAUSE THE IDEAL
THING WOULD BE TO "ESTABLISH DIFFERENT ECONOMIC RELATIONS, REDUCE
TAXES, GIVE PREFERENCE" TO LATIN AMERICAN PRODUCTS, AND "DEFINE THE
QUOTA SYSTEM."

   SAN SALVADOR, 18 FEB 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS AWAITING A REPLY FROM
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) REGARDING A
POSSIBLE RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE.

   CRISTIANI HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE COMALAPA AIRPORT THIS
MORNING PRIOR TO TRAVELING TO TAIWAN ON A TOUR WHICH, HE SAID, WILL
LAST UNTIL 3 MARCH.

   CRISTIANI DISCLOSED THAT AS PART OF HIS MEDIATION EFFORTS, THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL HAS TWICE SENT HIS PERSONAL DELEGATE, ALVARO DE
SOTO, WHO HAS BEEN TOLD THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DEMANDS THAT
THE FMLN HALT ITS HOSTILITIES AND SABOTAGE ACTIVITY AIMED AT
DISRUPTING NATIONAL COMMERCE.

   "WE KNOW," PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID, "THAT THE FMLN HAS ASKED FOR
TWO WEEKS TO STUDY AND RESPOND TO OUR LATEST PROPOSAL."

   THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO AN ATTACK LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS
MORNING ON AN ELECTRIC POWER SUBSTATION IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR,
DESCRIBING IT AS "A PUBLICITY PLOY TO IMPRESS THE UN SECRETARY
GENERAL."

   "WE ARE INSISTING ON A HALT TO HOSTILITIES" BECAUSE OF SUCH
ACTIONS, WHICH "CONSTITUTE ONLY TERRORISM AND DO NOT REPRESENT A
MILITARY THREAT," THE PRESIDENT SAID.

   THE PRESIDENT DENIED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC
AID IN OTHER REGIONS BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF FRG AID AND BECAUSE
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF U.S. AID CUTS.

   "THIS VISIT TO TAIWAN HAD BEEN SCHEDULED SINCE BEFORE THE GUERRILLA
OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER.  I RECEIVED THE INVITATION FROM THE TAIWAN
GOVERNMENT WHEN I TOOK OFFICE IN JUNE," CRISTIANI SAID.

   HE ADDED THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THE VISIT IS TO STRENGTHEN RELATIONS
AND TRADE WITH A FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS TO EXPRESS THANKS FOR
THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TAIWAN HAS PROVIDED.

   REGARDING AID FROM THE FRG, HE SAID "EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO
REESTABLISH IT.  THE FRG GOVERNMENT IS CONDITIONING ITS AID ON RESPECT
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE
COUNTRY."

   REFERRING TO U.S. AID, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID HE IS NOT
AWARE THAT OFFICIAL DECISIONS OR PLANS EXIST.  INSTEAD, THERE ARE
PERSONAL POSITIONS OF CONGRESSMEN OR SPECIAL-INTEREST GROUPS, BUT THIS
MUST BE FULLY DISCUSSED AT THE TIME OF THE VOTE FOR THE NEXT FISCAL
YEAR, WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES BEGINS IN OCTOBER.

   THE PRESIDENT ALSO DEFENDED THE RECENT ECONOMIC MEASURES, WHICH
HAVE LED TO PROTESTS AGAINST THE GENERAL INCREASE IN PRICES OF
STAPLES.  HE SAID THESE MEASURES WERE NECESSARY FOR THE COUNTRY'S
ECONOMY, WHICH WAS AFFECTED LAST YEAR, FIRST, BY THE OVERALL CUTS IN
U.S. AID TO THE REGION, A REDUCTION OF $55 MILLION FOR EL SALVADOR;
SECOND, BY THE DROP IN INTERNATIONAL COFFEE PRICES, WHICH CAUSED $150
MILLION IN LOSSES FOR EL SALVADOR; AND THIRD, BY THE DAMAGE FROM THE
GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER.

   BEFORE LEAVING ON HIS TRIP AND IN RESPONSE TO NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS,
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ALSO DEFENDED THE ARMED FORCES, STATING THAT THE
ACTIONS IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED RECENTLY HAVE NOT WEAKENED
THEM AND, ON THE CONTRARY, HAVE STRENGTHENED THE ARMED FORCES BECAUSE
ERRORS HAVE BEEN ADMITTED AND THOSE RESPONSIBLE ARE BEING PROSECUTED,
SUCH AS IN THE CASES OF THE JESUITS AND THE CIVILIANS WHO WERE KILLED
ON 11 FEBRUARY IN CHALATENANGO.

   CRISTIANI SAID THAT IN THE LATTER CASE THERE HAVE BEEN NO PRESSURES
AND THAT FROM THE MOMENT THAT THERE WAS NEWS ABOUT THE TRAGEDY, THE
COMMISSION THAT INVESTIGATES CRIMINAL ACTS WAS ORDERED TO UNDERTAKE
THE APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE TRAGEDY.
HE SAID IT CONCLUDED THAT THE TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A HELICOPTER
ROCKET, BUT THERE WAS NO BOMBING, ALTHOUGH THE CIVILIANS WERE VICTIMS
OF WAR ACTIONS.

   CRISTIANI CRITICIZED THE FMLN FOR WAGING BATTLES IN POPULATED AREAS
BECAUSE THIS ENDANGERS CIVILIANS.

   IN CONCLUSION, CRISTIANI SAID THE FMLN WILL NEVER GIVE UP ITS
ATTEMPTS TO WEAKEN OR DIVIDE THE ARMED FORCES, BUT HE ADDED THAT THE
ARMED FORCES ARE BECOMING MORE PROFESSIONAL EVERY DAY.

   THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), WHICH HAS A LEFTIST - NATIONALIST
ORIENTATION AND WHICH WAS PART OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA
COORDINATING BOARD, BEGAN 16 MONTHS AGO, OF ITS OWN ACCORD, A PEACE
PROCESS WITH VIRGILIO BARCO'S LIBERAL PARTY GOVERNMENT.

   THIS PEACE PLAN, WHICH HAS STUMBLED ACROSS SEVERAL POLITICAL
OBSTACLES THAT HAS PRECLUDED TOTAL COMPLIANCE, COULD END ON 28
FEBRUARY WITH THE M-19 HANDING OVER THEIR WEAPONS TO A SOCIALIST
INTERNATIONAL (IS) COMMISSION, THE FINAL PHASE BEING POSTPONED ON
SEVERAL OCCASIONS SINCE LAST DECEMBER.

   "YOUR RECENT STATEMENTS, CARDINAL, ON OPENING NEW ROADS TOWARD
PEACE SEEM IMPORTANT TO US," THE FARC COMMANDERS STATE IN THEIR LETTER
TO CARDINAL LOPEZ TRUJILLO.

   "YOUR EMINENCE SAYS THAT IT WOULD MEAN GREAT PROGRESS FOR THE
COUNTRY IF THE FARC WERE TO TAKE PART IN A COHERENT PEACE PROCESS,"
THE NOTE GOES ON, ADDING: "YOUR EMINENCE SHOULD KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED IN THIS EFFORT EVER SINCE BELISARIO BETANCUR'S (FORMER
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT) AMNESTY, WHICH STOPPED A 25-YEAR WAR."

   IN 1984, UNDER BELISARIO BETANCUR'S SOCIAL - CONSERVATIVE
GOVERNMENT (1982 - 1986), A PEACE PROCESS BEGAN THAT RESULTED IN THE
CREATION OF THE LEGAL LEFT-WING PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) MOVEMENT --
INITIALLY COMPRISED OF FORMER FARC GUERRILLAS -- AND AN AGREEMENT
RENDERING THE GUERRILLA GROUP'S GENERAL STAFF CAMP INVIOLABLE.

   THE FARC LEADERS SAY IN THEIR LETTER TO THE CARDINAL THAT THE BARCO
GOVERNMENT "DID NOT WANT OR COULD NOT CONTINUE BETANCUR'S POLICY OF
PEACE AND RECONCILIATION."

   "IF THE COLOMBIAN CHURCH, JUDGING BY THE CARDINAL'S STATEMENTS,
SERVES AS AN ITERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS, WE
APPLAUD THAT HUMANISTIC AND PATRIOTIC DECISION," THE FARC GENERAL
STAFF'S LETTER SAYS.

   THE GUERRILLA GROUP ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE YESTERDAY PROPOSING THAT
THE BARCO GOVERNMENT DECLARE A GENERAL CEASE-FIRE FOR THE 11 MARCH
LEGISLATIVE AND 27 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, TO WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
HAS NOT YET RESPONDED.

   HOWEVER, WITH PREVIOUS REQUESTS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS LIMITED ITSELF
TO ASKING THE GUERRILLAS FOR UNILATERAL TRUCES TO PROVE THEIR DESIRE
FOR PEACE, WHICH HAS ONLY WORKED OUT IN THE CASE OF THE M-19.

   ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD,
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UC-ELN, DECLARED UNILATERAL TRUCES DURING
THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

   THE PRO-CASTRO GROUP IS THE ONLY ONE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE A
SABOTAGE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE ELECTIONS, CHARACTERIZED BY KIDNAPPINGS,
ATTACKS ON RURAL VILLAGES, THREATS TO OFFICIALS, AND POLICE AND ARMY
AMBUSHES.

   LIMA, 18 FEB 90 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA] [EXCERPT] PERU HAS FACED THE GREAT ADVERSITY OF
FOREIGN IMPERIALISM.  PERU, A POOR AND WEAK BUT SOVEREIGN COUNTRY, HAS
RAISED ITS VOICE TO FACE THE POWER AND GREED OF THE INTERNATIONAL
BANKING SECTORS. PERU AND THE PERUVIAN STATE HAVE REFUSED TO PAY AN
UNJUST DEBT.  THIS WILL BE FOREVER REGARDED AS THE PIONEER AND
VANGUARD ATTITUDE OF THE THIRD WORLD.

   NO ONE WILL EVER FORGET THAT, IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF MY
ADMINISTRATION, THE PERUVIAN RESOURCES THAT WERE SCHEDULED TO BE USED
TO PAY THE FOREIGN DEBT WERE INSTEAD USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF PERU. ALL
PERUVIANS ADMITTED AT THE TIME THAT WE HAD BEGUN A PROCESS OF
CAPITALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT.

   I HAVE COME HERE TODAY TO DELIVER SOME TRACTORS.  BUT I WANT TO
TELL YOU THAT DURING THE APRA [AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY
ALLIANCE] ADMINISTRATION THE NUMBER OF TRACTORS HAS DOUBLED.  WHEN THE
APRA ASSUMED POWER IN 1985, THERE WERE 5,060 TRACTORS IN PERU.  BUT
AFTER I DELIVER THESE ITALIAN TRACTORS, THERE WILL BE 11,200.  THIS
MEANS THAT THE AMOUNT OF LAND BEING FARMED MECHANICALLY IN PERU HAS
DOUBLED.  APPLAUSE, CHEERS OF "ALAN, ALAN"

   THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN INVESTED IN
EQUIPMENT OPERATING IN PERU TODAY IS THE SAME MONEY THAT, IN A
SOVEREIGN DECISION, THE FATHERLAND REFUSED TO SEND ABROAD TO FOREIGN
INTERNATIONAL BANKS.  SHOUTS OF "WELL DONE" THE ANTI-IMPERIALISTIC
IDEAL THAT WE UPHOLD IS BASED ON THIS MAIN PRINCIPLE: TO RETAIN OUR
RESOURCES WITHIN PERU.

   WE HAVE ALSO RAISED OUR VOICES TO DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY AND
INTEGRITY OF OUR CONTINENT, BECAUSE WE ARE A PROUD AND FREE CONTINENT.
WHEN WE SAW MILITARISTIC IMPERIALISM THREATEN AND INVADE A BROTHER
COUNTRY, WE HAD THE HONOR -- THE SAD HONOR -- OF BEING THE ONLY ONE TO
RAISE ITS VOICE AND TO MAKE IMPERIALISM, DUE TO THE FIRMNESS OF THE
PERUVIAN STANCE, HEED OUR DEMANDS AND WITHDRAW ITS INVADING TROOPS
FROM PANAMA."

   I REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF 20 DECEMBER 1989, WHEN AT 0500 GMT I WAS
INFORMED FROM WASHINGTON THAT 24,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS HAD OCCUPIED
PANAMA. I RECEIVED MANY PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO TOLD ME: IT IS A
DONE DEED.  LET THEM INVADE THE COUNTRY.  WE DO NOT NEED TO CONFRONT
THEM.  I RECEIVED PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE IN PERU AND ABROAD TELLING
ME THAT WE COULD NOT CONFRONT THEM, THAT WE COULD NOT MAKE ANY
DEMANDS.  THEY SAID FOR US TO ACT AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.  LET US
RECOGNIZE THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY HAVE PUT IN POWER.  BUT I SAID NO.
PEOPLE SHOUT "WELL DONE" I WAS TOLD: IF YOU KEEP SILENT, YOU CAN SOLVE
YOUR PROBLEM WITH THE IMF. BUT I SAID NO, BECAUSE THE DIGNITY OF A
NATION IS NOT FOR SALE.  NO, BECAUSE THE DIGNITY OF LATIN AMERICA
CANNOT BE BOUGHT.  APPLAUSE, CHEERS OF "ALAN, ALAN"

   CAUSING FEAR AND ASTONISHMENT FOR MANY PEOPLE IN PERU AND
THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA, I SAID: WE ARE POOR. WE HAVE NO GREAT
MILITARY POWER. WE HAVE NO PLANES OR BOMBS.  WE HAVE NO BANKS FILLED
 WITH MILLIONS.  BUT WE HAVE THE POWER OF REASON, WHICH IS MORE
POWERFUL.  WE HAVE THE POWER OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS GREATER.  WE HAVE
THE POWER OF FREEDOM, WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT.  I SAID THAT WE WOULD
RECALL THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR FROM WASHINGTON.  WE WOULD WITHDRAW       
FROM THE MILITARY ALLIANCE THAT WE HAVE WITH THE UNITED STATES,
WHICH ALLOWED IT TO PERPETRATE THIS INVASION. WE WOULD TELL THE
UNITED STATES THAT UNTIL THE LAST SOLDIER WAS WITHDRAWN, WE WOULD
NOT SIT AT ANY NEGOTIATING TABLE, NOT ON DRUGS OR ON ANY OTHER
SUBJECT.

   BUT THE PERUVIAN RIGHTIST SECTORS DESCRIBED EVERYTHING I SAID ON 21
DECEMBER, EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE PANAMANIAN INVASION, AS INSANE.  THEY
DESCRIBED IT AS DEMAGOGIC THEATRICS.  THEY SAID WE SHOULD COMPLY WITH
THE U.S. ACTIONS.  BUT I SAID NO. ALTHOUGH WE RESPECT THE UNITED
STATES AND ITS PEOPLE, WE DO NOT TOLERATE IMPERIALISTIC IMPOSITIONS.
WE DO NOT TOLERATE OTHER COUNTRIES INTERVENING IN THE SOVEREIGN
AFFAIRS OF SISTER-NATIONS.

   I CAN STATE WITH GREAT SATISFACTION THAT, 24 HOURS BEFORE THE
CARTAGENA SUMMIT AND 2 MONTHS AFTER THE INVASION, THE LAST U.S.
SOLDIER WITHDREW FROM PANAMA.  THIS WAS THE SINE QUA NON CONDITION FOR
MY ATTENDANCE AT THE SUMMIT.  APPLAUSE, CHEERS

   THIS PROVES THAT YOU CAN BE POOR AND ECONOMICALLY WEAK, BUT THAT
YOU CAN HAVE THE STRENGTH THAT COMES FROM REASON, FROM MORAL
PRINCIPLES; THAT YOU CAN HAVE JUSTICE ON YOUR SIDE; THAT YOU CAN
SUCCEED, THAT SOONER OR LATER YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.  PERHAPS JUSTICE
MAY COME LATE, BUT IT COMES.  WHEN I SEE THE OLIGARCHIC ATTACK OF THE
PREPOTENT ECONOMIC POWER HITTING PERU, I TELL THE PEOPLE THAT THE
RIGHTIST SECTORS MAY BE VICTORIOUS. BUT IT WILL BE AN EPHEMERAL,
TEMPORARY, AND MOMENTARY VICTORY BECAUSE IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO WILL
SUCCEED, THE PEOPLE WHO WILL CONQUER, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE RIGHT,
THE PEOPLE HAVE JUSTICE ON THEIR SIDE, AND BECAUSE PERU BELONGS TO THE
PEOPLE.  APPLAUSE, CHEERS [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 18 FEB 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP
ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS DEPLORED YESTERDAY THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT
THE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED RECENTLY "BECAUSE THEY WILL AFFECT POOR
SECTORS ONLY," AND INSISTED ON THE NEED TO END THE WAR.

   RECALLING FROM THE CATHEDRAL'S PULPIT THE PROMISE PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI MADE IN HIS INAUGURAL SPEECH THAT HE WOULD "STRUGGLE FOR THE
POOREST OF THE POOR," MONSIGNOR RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID THE MECHANISMS
USED BY THE GOVERNMENT ARE NOT THE MOST ADEQUATE ONES TO RESOLVE THE
SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN EL SALVADOR.

   "IF WE WANT TO HELP THE POOREST AMONG THE POOR, WE MUST NOT ONLY
HONESTLY AND OBJECTIVELY EXAMINE THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT MODEL, BUT
SEEK A DEFINITIVE SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF WAR," THE PRELATE
EXCLAIMED.

   THE HIGHEST REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN EL SALVADOR
SAID THAT, IN EXAMINING THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SITUATION, "THE
TERRORIST ACTIONS PERPETRATED BY THE GUERRILLAS CANNOT BE IGNORED."

   RIVERA Y DAMAS WARNED: "IF WAR CONTINUES TO BE WAGED IN THE
COUNTRY, IT WILL CONTINUE TO STRIKE AT US MERCILESSLY AND INHUMANLY,
HOUR AFTER HOUR."

   THE SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOP REITERATED THAT THE "ONLY WAY OUT" OF THE
ARMED CONFLICT IS DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION, BECAUSE "VIOLENCE BEGETS
ONLY VIOLENCE."

   HE ALSO SAID: "THE BLOOD SHED IN THE WEE HOURS OF 16 NOVEMBER BY
THE JESUIT CHURCHMEN WHO WERE BRUTALLY MOWED DOWN IS WORKING FOR THE
POOR MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN THEIR ACADEMIC AND THEOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES
SERVING THE PEOPLE'S EDUCATION."

   HE WAS REFERRING TO THE MASSACRE OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WERE
KILLED BY MILITARY MEN, NOW UNDER TRIAL.

   SANTIAGO, 5 FEB 90 (HOY) -- [ARTICLE] [GILBERTO VILLARROEL] [TEXT]
ON THE EVENING OF 20 MAY 1986, THE JENKA, A DANISH CARGO SHIP WITH AN
EMPTY HOLD, WAS ANCHORED IN VALPARAISO BAY.

   THE SHIP, WHICH WAS SPECIALLY FITTED TO CARRY WEAPONS, HAD BEEN
"WAITING INTO LINE" FOR 120 DAYS, MEANING -- IN PORT OPERATION JARGON
-- THAT IT WAS WAITING FOR ITS TURN OR FOR THE ARRIVAL OF ITS CARGO.

   THE FIVE-MAN CREW WAS UNEASY. THEY WERE WAITING FOR A SHIPMENT OF
400 "WASP" CLUSTER BOMBS PRODUCED BY FERRIMAR [EXPANSION UNKNOWN] -- A
SUBSIDIARY OF FAMAE (ARMY ORDNANCE) -- AND BOUND FOR THE MIDDLE EAST.
THE DESTINATION OF THE SHIPMENT WAS IRAN. THE USERS: THE ARMED FORCES
OF IMAM RUHOLLAH KHOMEINI.

   THE SECRET SHIPMENT WAS HAVING PROBLEMS ON LAND.

   THE FIVE CREW MEMBERS MADE A DECISION THAT NIGHT, TAKING ON FUEL
AND FOOD AND FLEEING TOWARD PANAMA. IN THE DARK NO ONE NOTICED THE
SHIP'S DEPARTURE, NOT THE SHIPPING COMPANY THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF THE
SHIP NOR THE PORT'S CAPTAIN -- A NAVY OFFICER WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO
AUTHORIZE THE MOVE. THE JENKA LEFT AN UNPAID DEBT OF $30,000 OWED TO
THE SHIPPING COMPANY.

   THE CASE WAS REPORTED BY THE PRESS AND FERRIMAR RUSHED TO SAY THAT
IT WAS SELLING WEAPONS TO PAKISTAN AND NIGERIA. IT WAS ALSO SAID THAT
THE GOVERNMENT, FOR ETHICAL REASONS, WOULD NOT ALLOW THE ENTERPRISE TO
OFFER THE "WASP" BOMBS TO IRAN. IN FACT, CHILEAN BUSINESSMAN CARLOS
CARDOEN WAS ALREADY SELLING "CLUSTERS" [PRECEDING WORD IN ENGLISH] TO
IRAQ. DOING BUSINESS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE TWO SIDES CONFRONTING EACH
OTHER IN THE LONG PERSIAN GULF WAR WAS NOT CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE.

   THE DEAL, HOWEVER, WAS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THERE COULD BE MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS IN PROFITS. COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL AND THE USSR WERE KNOWN
TO BE SELLING WEAPONS TO BOTH IRAN AND IRAQ. THE USSR WAS DIRECTLY
SELLING WEAPONS TO IRAQ AND SUPPLYING IRAN THROUGH MIDDLEMEN. CHILE
KNEW OF A SIMILAR EXAMPLE: DURING THE BEAGLE CHANNEL CONFLICT, WHICH
ALMOST ENDED IN A WAR WITH ARGENTINA, ISRAEL SOLD MISSILES TO BOTH
SIDES.

   THEREFORE, IN A CAREFULLY PLANNED OPERATION, FERRIMAR AND FAMAE
WERE ABLE TO SELL CLUSTER BOMBS TO IRAN.

   THE MIDDLEMAN WOULD BE FRENCHMAN BERNARD STROIAZZO, THE SAME PERSON
WHO THREE YEARS LATER WOULD CAUSE THE "IRAN-CORFO" [PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION] SCANDAL (HOY, NO. 655).

   IT IS ONLY NOW THAT STROIAZZO'S HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC. AN
ENGINEER HIRED BY IRAN'S NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANY, HE SERVED AS A
REPRESENTATIVE OF FERRIMAR AND FAMAE TO THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE
SALE OF CLUSTER BOMBS IN 1986. AFTER TWO SHIPMENTS OF DEFECTIVE BOMBS,
THE IRANIANS DECIDED THAT THEY COULD CAUSE MORE CASUALTIES AMONG THEIR
OWN MEN THAN AMONG ENEMY TROOPS. STROIAZZO WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE FOR 18
MONTHS.

   HE MANAGED TO LEAVE AND TRAVELED TO CHILE. WITH THE HELP OF CNI
[NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER] DIRECTOR BRIGADIER GENERAL HUGO SALAS,
HE CONTACTED CORFO OFFICIALS WHO HELPED HIM ARRANGE COMPENSATION. HE
ARRANGED A PRELIMINARY ACCORD FOR ESTABLISHING A TOXIC WASTE RECYCLING
PLANT IN CHILE, BUT THE DEAL FAILED. HE THEN FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST
CORFO IN THE 19TH CIVIL COURT OF SANTIAGO.  CORFO HAS NOT YET BEEN
NOTIFIED OF THE LAWSUIT. THE PROBLEM, AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE TOXIC
WASTE PLANT IS CONCERNED, WILL BE INHERITED BY THE NEW GOVERNMENT --
WHICH WILL TAKE OVER ON 11 MARCH -- AND BY CORFO.

   DID FERRIMAR LIE TO THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT?

   THIS ENTERPRISE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE GOOD CONTACTS WITH THE
AUTHORITIES. AMONG THE PARTNERS OF FERRIMAR OWNER ALDO PESCE WERE
RETIRED GENERAL MANUEL CONTRERAS SEPULVEDA, FORMER CHIEF OF THE
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, DINA; GENERAL RAUL REYES, FAMAE
DIRECTOR, AND COLONEL CARLOS CARRENO, WHO WAS A FAMAE EXECUTIVE AND AN
ADVISER TO FERRIMAR ON THE PRODUCTION OF THE "WASP" BOMBS. (A LAWSUIT
FILED WITH THE 14TH CRIMINAL COURT OF SANTIAGO UNDER "ROBBERY OF
INDUSTRIAL SECRETS" CHARGES CLAIMS THAT THE BOMBS WERE BUILT WITH
PLANS STOLEN FROM CARLOS CARDOEN BY ONE OF CARDOEN'S TRUSTED MEN.)

   TO EXPORT ITS BOMBS, FERRIMAR NEEDED THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE
DEFENSE AND FOREIGN MINISTRIES. THE COMPANY HAD TO PROVIDE WHAT IS
KNOWN IN THE INTERNATIONAL WEAPONS MARKET IS KNOWN AS AN "END-USER
CERTIFICATE" OR "FINAL-USER CERTIFICATE." FERRIMAR GOT ONE. IT WAS
SIGNED IN AUGUST 1985 BY A NIGERIAN ARMY OFFICER WHO, ACCORDING TO
SOURCES CLOSE TO THE CASE, HAD RETIRED A LONG TIME AGO. A "TRIANGLE
OPERATION" WAS CARRIED OUT TO CONCEAL THE TRUE OPERATION. IT IS NOT
KNOWN WHETHER THE DEFENSE MINISTRY HAS INDICTED ANYONE OVER THE
DECEPTION BY WHICH IT WAS VICTIMIZED.

   AT THE END OF JANUARY 1986, THE FIRST 100 BOMBS WERE SHIPPED BY
PLANE TO BANDAR ABBAS AIRPORT IN IRAN. EACH BOMB WEIGHED 227 KG AND
CONTAINED 248 AMMUNITION PACKAGES, SOME OF THEM FOR IMMEDIATE
DISCHARGE AND OTHERS FOR DELAYED ACTION.  THESE WERE CAPABLE OF MINING
LARGE AREAS FOR UP TO 72 HOURS AFTER A BATTLE.

   THE FIRST SHIPMENT WAS WORTH $7 MILLION; $1 MILLION WAS FOR
STROIAZZO AND $1.5 MILLION WENT FOR THE COST OF THE BOMBS. THE PRICE
OF THE BOMBS ABROAD WAS $14,000 EACH, BUT THEIR REAL COST WAS ONLY
$3,000. THE CHILEAN CONTACT IN THIS OPERATION, FERNANDO PEREZ, WAS TO
HAVE RECEIVED $4.5 MILLION.

   A TEST WAS PERFORMED IN IRAN AND THE BOMBS DID NOT WORK. THE
IRANIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY ASKED THAT NEW TESTS BE CARRIED OUT IN CHILE.

   BOGOTA, 20 FEB 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] U.S. AMBASSADOR TO COLOMBIA
THOMAS MCNAMARA HAS BEEN DECLARED A PRIORITY "MILITARY TARGET" OF THE
MARXIST ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) GUERRILLA GROUP, THE ELN
ANNOUNCED TODAY IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO EFE IN BOGOTA.

   THE COMMUNIQUE WAS DELIVERED IN THE MIDST OF AN ELN OFFENSIVE THAT
HAS LASTED FOR OVER THREE WEEKS.  IT HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY
KIDNAPPINGS, ATTACKS ON TOWNS, MOBILE ROADBLOCKS ON THE MAIN HIGHWAYS,
AND AMBUSHES SET FOR MILITARY AND POLICE PERSONNEL.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLA GROUP, THE PURPOSE OF THE ATTACK IS TO
PROTEST U.S. INTERVENTION IN COLOMBIA, TO SABOTAGE THE MUNICIPAL AND
LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 11 MARCH, AND THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTIONS ON 27 MAY, AND TO DENOUNCE THE "DIRTY WAR."

   IN TODAY'S MESSAGE THE ELN LISTS "AMBASSADOR THOMAS MCNAMARA" AS A
"PRIORITY" MILITARY OBJECTIVE AT THE TOP OF THEIR LIST.  IT ADDED THAT
OTHER TARGETS ARE "U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS," "U.S. CITIZENS WHO HEAD
THE MULTINATIONAL TEXAS AND OCCIDENTAL OIL COMPANIES," AND "ALL
AMERICANS WHO INTERVENE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IN OUR NATION'S INTERNAL
CONFLICT."

   THIS PRO-CASTRO GUERRILLA GROUP IS HOLDING U.S. CITIZENS DAVID
LESLIE KENT AND JAMES ARTHUR DONELLY, WHO WERE KIDNAPPED IN MEDELLIN
ON 12 AND 13 FEBRUARY, TO PROTEST U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S VISIT

   U.S. PRIEST FRANCISCO AMICO FERRARI, KIDNAPPED ON 15 FEBRUARY IN
CALI, WAS RELEASED ON 19 FEBRUARY BY THE ELN WITH A MESSAGE ABOUT
"OPERATION COLOMBIA," WHICH DENOUNCES U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE "DIRTY
WAR" WITH WHICH COLOMBIA IS AFFLICTED.

   IN TODAY'S COMMUNIQUE THE GUERRILLAS SAY "THE UNITED STATES HAS
MILITARY ADVISERS IN THE COLOMBIAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS TO DIRECT THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRTY WAR."

   THEY ALSO DENOUNCE "THE DIRECT LEADERSHIP OF U.S. ADVISERS IN
INTELLIGENCE AND MILITARY REPRESSION OPERATIONS IN THE AREAS OF
CONFLICT."

   THE ELN IS ALSO STILL HOLDING SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE SENATOR JORGE
SEDANO GONZALEZ, KIDNAPPED ON 9 FEBRUARY NEAR BUCARAMANGA, IN THE
NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ALONG WITH HIS SECRETARY JORGE MESA,
WHO WAS RELEASED ON MONDAY.

   THE ELN RELEASED MESA WITH A MESSAGE FOR FORMER SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE
PRESIDENT MISAEL PASTRANA (1970-1974), REITERATING THAT SEDANO WILL BE
RELEASED ONLY IF HE DECLARES THAT HE IS OPPOSED TO THE DIRTY WAR AND
REVEALS THE WHEREABOUTS OF FERNANDO PORRAS, AN ELN MEMBER WHO
DISAPPEARED IN BUCARAMANGA ON 5 FEBRUARY.  ACCORDING TO THE
GUERRILLAS, PORRAS WAS ARRESTED AND "DISAPPEARED" BY THE 5TH ARMY
BRIGADE, WHICH DENIES THIS.

   THE ELN IS THE ONLY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS PERSISTED IN
THE ARMED STRUGGLE.  THE FIVE OTHER REBEL GROUPS HAVE DECLARED
UNILATERAL TRUCES TO GUARANTEE A CLIMATE OF PEACE FOR THE UPCOMING
ELECTIONS.

   THESE GROUPS ARE THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF
COLOMBIA, THE MAOIST POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY, THE TROTSKYIST
[REVOLUTIONARY] WORKERS PARTY, AND THE INDIAN "QUINTIN LAME" MOVEMENT,

   TEGUCIGALPA, 22 FEB 90 (SAN PEDRO SULA TIEMPO) -- [TEXT] CONTRA COMMANDER
ISRAEL GALEANO, ALIAS FRANKLIN, HAS TOLD TIEMPO THAT THE ANTI-SANDINIST
REBELS WILL STAY ARMED, REGARDLESS OF THE RESULTS OF THE 25 FEBRUARY
ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, TO MAKE SURE THE DEMOCRATIC CHANGES TAKE PLACE.

   "WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT EVEN IF THE UNO [NATIONAL
OPPOSITION UNION] WINS, WAITING FOR PROFOUND DEMOCRATIC CHANGES AND AN
END TO THE REPRESSIVE REGIME IMPOSED BY THE SANDINISTS," SAID THE
CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE (RN).

   THIS PAST JANUARY, THE 29-YEAR-OLD GALEANO BECAME THE LEADER OF
ABOUT 12,000 NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST REBELS BASED IN HONDURAS WHEN THE
POST OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE RN ARMY, A POST ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ HAD
HELD FOR 10 YEARS, WAS ELIMINATED.

   NICARAGUA WILL HOLD ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY, AND THE MAIN
CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ARE DANIEL ORTEGA OF THE SANDINIST
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FSLN) AND VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO OF THE UNO.

   THE REBELS, SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE URGED NICARAGUANS
TO VOTE FOR THE UNO CANDIDATE.

   "IF THE UNO WINS, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT TO SEE
IF ON 25 APRIL THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSFER OF POWER AND PROFOUND
REFORMS, AND PARTICULARLY TO SEE IF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM DISAPPEARS,"
GALEANO SAID.

   "IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR STEAL THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A
SOCIAL DISRUPTION AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND THE HARDEST STRUGGLE OF
RECENT YEARS WILL TAKE PLACE," HE ADDED.

   THE CONTRA MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT "IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT ACCEPT A
SANDINIST VICTORY, "WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE FIGHTING."

   HE ASSURED THAT THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOT ACCEPT AN FSLN VICTORY IN
THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS.

   GALEANO ADDED THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED APPROXIMATELY
30,000 TROOPS IN THE NORTHERN NICARAGUAN DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO
"INTIMIDATE AND MURDER" UNO FOLLOWERS AND TO PREVENT APPROXIMATELY
300,000 NICARAGUANS FROM VOTING.

   GALEANO POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESS AND THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS OF THE
ELECTIONS HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE AREAS WHERE THE NICARAGUAN TROOPS HAVE
DEPLOYED.

   "EVEN THOUGH THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS CLAIM THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS
FREELY HELD, THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE SACRIFICES," HE SAID.

   GALEANO SAID THAT ABOUT 5,000 OF HIS MEN ARE INSIDE NICARAGUA, AND
BETWEEN 10,000 TO 12,000 MEN ARE IN BASES IN HONDURAS, "NOT MOVING,BUT
JUST OBSERVING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS" IN NICARAGUA.

   THE REBELS IN HONDURAS ARE RECEIVING U.S. HUMANITARIAN AID IN EL
PRAISO DEPARTMENT AND HAVE REJECTED A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN APPROVED BY
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  THE REBELS CLAIM THEY DO NOT HAVE
ANY GUARANTEES FOR THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY AND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION
OF A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   "THE DEMOBILIZATION IS BASED ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CREATING
CONDITIONS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED RN TO JOIN
CIVIC LIFE," HE ADDED.

   GALEANO SAID THAT THE DISMANTLING OF HIS FORCES DOES NOT "DEPEND OF
A SIMPLE ELECTIONS," BUT RATHER ON "THE SANDINISTS LEAVING POWER
COMPLETELY."

   THE CONTRA LEADER WARNED THAT "WE CANNOT LAY DOWN OUR WEAPONS WHEN
THE CAUSES THAT LED TO OUR TAKING UP ARMS HAVE NOT DISAPPEARED.  THERE
STILL IS REPRESSION, A LACK OF FREEDOM, AND ALL OF THIS WAS GENERATED
BY THE SANDINISTS."

   HE POINTED OUT THAT IN THE EVENT THE UNO SHOULD WIN THE 25 FEBRUARY
ELECTIONS, "WE WOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT A MUTUAL DEMOBILIZATION.  THE
NICARAGUAN PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED WITH AN INTER-AMERICAN PEACE FORCE
THAT WILL RECEIVE ALL THE WEAPONRY AND SOVIET TANKS OF THE SANDINISTS.
THEN, WHEN WE ARE AT AN EVEN LEVEL OF FORCES, WE WILL TURN OVER OUR
OWN WEAPONS."

   THE CONTRA CHIEF SUGGESTED A NATIONAL POLICE BE CREATED IN
NICARAGUA.

   FRANKLIN SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE PEACE
TALKS, BUT PERHAPS AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT.

   HE ASSURED THAT THE REBEL FORCES WILL NOT CARRY OUT "ANY OFFENSIVE
OPERATIONS BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER THE ELECTIONS, AND WILL WAIT AND
SEE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN NICARAGUA."

   HE SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THEIR CAMPS IN
YAMALES IF REQUESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS.

   "IF POLITICAL CONDITIONS DO NOT ALLOW US TO REMAIN, WE WILL LEAVE

   THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE CONTRAS SAID THAT HIS FORCES WILL NOT
ATTACK THE UN PEACE OBSERVORS ON THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER AREA.

   HE SAID THAT RN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES ARE NORMAL, BUT

   MOSCOW (USSR), 18 FEB 90 (PRAVDA) -- [ARTICLE] [PAVEL BOGOMOLOV]
[TEXT] THE ANNALS OF THE COLOMBIAN PORT OF CARTAGENA LIST THREE
EXTREMELY FIERCE SIEGES.  BACK IN 1586, THE "JEWEL OF THE CARIBBEAN"
WAS CAPTURED BY SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, WHO DID NOT BURN THE CITY TO THE
GROUND ONLY BECAUSE HE RECEIVED A RANSOM OF 10 MILLION PESOS.  A
CENTURY LATER CARTAGENA WAS OCCUPIED BY THE FRENCH.  FINALLY, IN 1741,
THE CITY'S DEFENDERS SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT OFF AN ASSAULT BY A HOST OF
27,000 PIRATES HEADED BY SIR EDWARD VERNON...

   THE WESTERN PRESS DESCRIBED THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS OF
THE UNITED STATES, BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, AND PERU HELD A FEW DAYS AGO IN
CARTAGENA AS A KIND OF ASSAULT.  DESPITE SOME EXAGGERATION, THIS
GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION WAS BASED ON PERFECTLY SERIOUS GROUNDS.  AFTER
ALL, THE CONFERENCE DID DISCUSS IMMEDIATE TASKS AND EVEN A DETAILED
SCHEDULE FOR A JOINT OFFENSIVE BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE COUNTRIES
AGAINST CRIMINAL DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH RANKS FIRST IN THE PECKING
ORDER OF CRIME.

   IT IS INDEED NECESSARY TO LAUNCH AN ASSAULT AGAINST THE DRUG
MAFIA'S STRONGHOLDS, WHETHER IN MEDELLIN, "FAMOUS" FOR UNBRIDLED
GANGSTERISM, OR IN CARTAGENA ITSELF, WHOSE STATUS AS A RESORT IS
THREATENED BY THE SELFSAME "COCAINE BARONS."  AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THIS TOURIST CENTER HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY SHAKEN IN RECENT MONTHS BY THE
EXPLOSIONS OF BOMBS PLANTED BY TERRORISTS IN THE "HILTON" HOTEL, IN
STORES, OR AT ITS MARINAS.  IT IS NO WONDER, AS REUTER REPORTS, THAT
NOT A SINGLE CRUISE SHIP HAS DROPPED ANCHOR THERE THIS SEASON.

   YES, THE SITUATION IS HIGHLY ALARMING, AND THIS APPLIES TO THE
WHOLE OF COLOMBIA AND EVEN TO THE ENTIRE REGION.  IN THESE CONDITIONS
THE FIRM RESOLVE DISPLAYED BY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE CARTAGENA
MEETING DESERVES UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT: THE RESOLVE TO FINALLY
POOL THEIR EFFORTS IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME AND TO
JOINTLY PLACE A RELIABLE BARRIER IN ITS PATH.  THESE ARE THE
INTENTIONS SHOWN IN THE JOINT STATEMENT SIGNED BY THE FOUR PRESIDENTS
AND BY THE SERIES OF SPECIAL DOCUMENTS.

   THE AIM OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS NOBLE INDEED: TO BESIEGE THE DRUG
MAFIA IN ITS NESTS, TO CUT OFF THE "LAUNDERING" OF DRUG DOLLARS, AND
TO DEPRIVE THE MERCHANTS OF "SLOW DEATH" OF BROAD ACCESS TO THE "BLACK
MARKET" IN THE UNITED STATES, WHERE, AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE LION'S
SHARE OF SOUTH AMERICA'S POISONOUS EXPORT IS CONSUMED.  IN OTHER
WORDS, AN IMPORTANT STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN TO COMBAT ONE OF THE MAIN
"EVILS OF THE 20TH CENTURY," AND IT WAS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT THE
MEETING'S RESULTS WERE POSITIVELY APPRAISED BY UN SECRETARY GENERAL J.
PEREZ DE CUELLAR.

   HERE IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION: EMPHASIS IN CARTAGENA WAS PLACED ON
ADMINISTRATIVE AND POLICE MEASURES AND ON WASHINGTON'S PRIMARILY
MILITARIZED FORMS OF COOPERATION WITH THE ANDEAN STATES, BUT DOES THIS
CONFORM WITH THEIR LONG-TERM NATIONAL INTERESTS, WITH THEIR DESIRE TO
PUT AN END TO BACKWARDNESS AND ATTAIN A QUALITATIVELY NEW LEVEL OF
SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT?  AFTER ALL, A RADICAL SOLUTION OF THE DRUG
PROBLEM PRIMARILY DEMANDS NEITHER COMBAT AIRCRAFT NOT ARMORED
PERSONNEL CARRIERS, BUT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT.  IT IS NECESSARY TO
CHANGE THE ECONOMIC PROFILE OF VAST PROVINCES WHERE THE CULTIVATION OF
COCA AND MARIJUANA IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF THE POPULATION'S EXISTENCE.

   TRUE ENOUGH, THE UNITED STATES HAS NOW EXPRESSED READINESS TO
ASSIST ALSO IN THIS SPHERE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS AN ALMOST
TOTAL LACK OF READINESS TO IMPORT FROM SOUTH AMERICA THE CROPS WHICH
COULD, IN PRINCIPLE, SQUEEZE OUT COCA AND MARIJUANA.  IT WAS NOT FOR
NOTHING THAT COLOMBIA'S PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, THE WHITE HOUSE'S
CLOSEST ALLY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS, WAS FORCED TO DECLARE IN
CARTAGENA THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RIGID PROTECTIONIST MEASURES ARE
JEOPARDIZING THE VERY FUTURE OF "ALTERNATIVE" SECTORS OF TROPICAL CROP
FARMING -- THE CULTIVATION OF COFFEE, FLOWERS, AND SUGAR CANE.  AND SO
THE "SENIOR PARTNER" APPEARS TO BE TIGHTENING WITH THE ONE HAND THE
VISE IN WHICH THE DRUG MAFIA NOW FINDS ITSELF, WHILE USING THE OTHER
HAND TO PROTECT ITS MARKET FROM LEGAL LATIN AMERICAN EXPORTS.

   FINALLY, THE LAST BUT, I THINK, MOST SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENT.
ACTUALLY, IT ALSO CASTS AN UNFAVORABLE LIGHT ON THE ROLE OF CONSISTENT
FIGHTER AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIA WHICH WASHINGTON HAS NOW ASSUMED.  THIS
ARGUMENT IS PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATED IN JUST ONE SHORT WORD: "PANAMA."
INDEED, DID THE RECENT AGGRESSION AGAINST THIS SOVEREIGN STATE, ONE OF
WHOSE MAIN MOTIVES WAS ACTUALLY "TO PUNISH THE DRUG BUSINESS BOSSES,"
NOT DEMONSTRATE ALL THE FLAWS OF WASHINGTON'S "STRONGARM APPROACH"
TOWARD LATIN AMERICA?  AND ARE THERE ANY GUARANTEES THAT THE PENTAGON
WILL NOT START "COPYING" ITS PANAMANIAN EXPERIENCE IN OTHER COUNTRIES
IN THE CONTINENT ON THE PRETEXT OF PURSUING THE "COCAINE BARONS"?

   THESE ARE FAR FROM RHETORICAL QUESTIONS, AND IT IS A PITY THAT
CARTAGENA SIMPLY FAILED TO PROVIDE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CLEAR-CUT
ANSWERS TO THEM.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 22 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS
CHARGED IN TEGUCIGALPA TODAY THAT ON 19 FEBRUARY THE SANDINIST AIR
FORCE USED AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS TO BOMB SEVERAL COMMUNITIES IN
ZELAYA, MATAGALPA, AND JINOTEGA DEPARTMENTS, IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN
NICARAGUA.

   THE REBELS DID NOT REPORT ANY DEAD OR WOUNDED IN THE ALLEGED
ATTACKS, WHICH THE CONTRAS SAY ARE PART OF AN OFFENSIVE BEGUN IN THE
DAYS PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS, SCHEDULED FOR SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE, THE CONTRAS INDICATED THAT THEIR FIGHTERS ARE NOT
ATTACKING SANDINIST MILITARY TARGETS, AND THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE
NICARAGUAN MILITARY ACTION WAS TO "CREATE CONFUSION" REGARDING THE
ELECTORAL PROCESS.

   ON THE OTHER HAND, COMMANDER "FRANKLIN" OF THE NICARAGUAN
RESISTANCE (RN) GENERAL STAFF SAID THAT THE RN WILL REMAIN "INTACT,"
EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT THE ELECTIONS ARE WON BY VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO,
CANDIDATE OF THE NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION (UNO).

   "WE WILL REMAIN INTACT TO SEE IF THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSMISSION OF
POWER ON 25 APRIL, IN WHICH THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE IN-DEPTH
REFORMS, PARTICULARLY THE ELIMINATION OF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM," HE
ADDED.

   THE RN MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR "STEAL"
THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A "SOCIAL UPRISING" IN NICARAGUA AGAINST
THE SYSTEM, AND THERE WILL BE "A HARSHER STRUGGLE THAN THAT OF PAST
YEARS."

   "FRANKLIN" SAID THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED SOME 30,000
TROOPS TO DEPARTMENTS IN NORTHERN NICARAGUA TO "INTIMIDATE AND MURDER"
UNO SYMPATHIZERS.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE CONTRAS WILL NOT PUT DOWN
THEIR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THE CAUSE THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF THOSE
FORCES -- THE SANDINISTS' ASCENT TO POWER -- "HAS NOT YET
DISAPPEARED," AND "THE REPRESSION CONTINUES."

   HE ADDED THAT HIS FIGHTERS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THE CAMPS IN
EASTERN HONDURAS IF THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT REQUESTS THAT THEY DO SO,
BUT THEIR FAMILIES WOULD REMAIN.

   BUENOS AIRES, 22 FEB 90 (DYN) -- [TEXT] A RELIABLE SOURCE TODAY
DISCLOSED THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF CHILEAN ARMED FORCES TO SOUTHERN
CHILE, INCLUDING ARMORED UNITS, AND THE IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY AND
QUALITY OF THE WEAPONS OF THE CHILEAN ARMED FORCES ARE CAUSING CONCERN
IN THE DEFENSE AREA.

   THE SOURCE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE MANUFACTURE OF A HELICOPTER
BY A PRIVATE CHILEAN FACTORY AS WELL AS THE PURCHASE OF SPANISH AND
U.S.-MADE AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS.

   THE HELICOPTER, WHOSE PROTOTYPE HAS ALREADY FLOWN A LARGE NUMBER OF
HOURS, HAS RECEIVED THE APPROVAL OF THE U.S. "AVIATION AGENCY"
[PRECEDING TWO WORDS IN ENGLISH], AN INDISPENSABLE REQUIREMENT FOR
SUBSEQUENT SALES ABROAD. IT IS MANUFACTURED BY THE PRIVATE CHILEAN
FACTORY CARDOEN WHICH PRODUCES CLUSTER BOMBS AND OTHER WAR MATERIEL
THAT CHILE EXPORTS TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES.

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT, DUE TO ITS EASY MAINTENANCE, OPERATION, AND
LOW COST, THIS HELICOPTER IS IDEAL FOR EXPORT TO TRADITIONAL CHILEAN
MARKETS SINCE SUBSTANTIAL PRODUCTION IS EASY TO ACHIEVE.

   THE SOURCE ALSO INDICATED THAT IN NOVEMBER, ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF
CHILEAN ARMY AVIATION, THREE SPANISH-MADE CASA 235 AIRPLANES, WHICH
CAN BE USED TO TRANSPORT PASSENGERS AND CARGO, AND 15 U.S.-MADE
ENSTROM 280 HELICOPTERS WERE PRESENTED.

   THE SOURCE DID NOT DISCLOSE "OTHER DATA," WHICH "REVEALS A
STRENGTHENING OF THE CHILEAN NAVAL, AIR, SEA, AND COMBAT AVIATION
RECENTLY."

THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC) WAS ACCEPTED TODAY
BY THE SO-CALLED COMMISSION OF NOTABLES, WHOSE MEMBERS ARE FIVE FORMER
PRESIDENTS, AND CHURCH AND BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES.

   HOWEVER, IN A MESSAGE ADDRESSED TO THE GUERRILLAS' CENTRAL COMMAND,
THE COMMISSION OF NOTABLES SAID THAT, ONCE THE CEASE-FIRE IS PUT INTO
EFFECT, THE FARC WILL HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE "WITH UNEQUIVOCAL DEEDS,"
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO INITIATE PEACE TALKS.

   THE FARC -- THE COUNTRY'S OLDEST AND LARGEST GUERRILLA GROUP -- HAS
EXPRESSED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THEIR INTENTION OF DECREEING A
CEASE-FIRE, ALTHOUGH YESTERDAY, ACCORDING TO ARMY SPOKESMEN, A FARC
COLUMN KILLED SEVEN SOLDIERS AND KIDNAPPED 15 DURING AN ATTACK ON AN
ARMY GARRISON.

   A FEW DAYS AGO, THE COMMISSION OF NOTABLES, MADE UP OF FORMER
PRESIDENTS CARLOS LLERAS RSTREPO, ALFONSO LOPEZ MIC HELSEN, JULIO
CESAR TURBAY, MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, AND BELISARIO BETANCUR, AS WELL
AS CARDINAL MARIO REVOLLO BRAVO AND BUSINESSMAN FABIO ECHEVERRI
CORREA, TOLD THE FARC THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD A RIGHT TO FIGHT THEM.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY HOLDING PEACE TALKS ONLY WITH
THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), WHICH WILL SOON BE DEMOBILIZING THEIR
FRONTS TO REJOIN CIVILIAN LIFE.

   AT THE SAME TIME, THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) HAS
ANNOUNCED THAT THIS YEAR IT WILL STEP UP ITS ATTACKS IN AN EFFORT TO
SABOTAGE THE 11 MARCH MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS AND THE 27
MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

KIDNAPPED BY GUERRILLAS ON 12 FEBRUARY IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT IN
NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA, WERE RELEASED TODAY.

   JAMUS ARTHUR DONELLY, AN AUTOMOTIVE SPARE PARTS SALESMAN, AND
PROFESSOR DAVIS LESLIE KENT, WHO SPOKE TO NEWSMEN IN MEDELLIN,
REVEALED A MESSAGE FROM THE PRO-CASTROITE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION,
(ELN) WHICH HELD THEM HOSTAGE FOR 12 DAYS.

   "THE NEXT TIME THERE IS A MASSACRE OR THE GOVERNMENT CAUSES THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF ONE OF OUR COMPANIONS, SUCH AS JUAN FERNANDO PORRAS,
THE ELN WILL PUNISH THE WEALTHY PEOPLE, THE OLIGARCHY OF COLOMBIA,"
THE EXTREMIST GROUP'S MESSAGE STATED.  BOTH DONELLY, 62, AS WELL AS
KENT, 40, SAID THEY WERE TREATED WELL BY THE REBELS, WITH WHOM THEY
HAD BROAD DISCUSSIONS ON THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA.

   ACCORDING TO THE TWO U.S. CITIZENS, THE ELN KIDNAPPED THEM AS PART
OF THE SO-CALLED "OPERATION COLOMBIA" TO PROTEST THE RECENT PRESENCE
OF U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH IN COLOMBIA, WHICH HOSTED THE RECENT 15
FEBRUARY ARTIDRUG SUMMIT IN CARTAGENA, AND WHAT THEY CALLED
"INCREASING U.S. INTERVENTION IN COLOMBIA."

   DONELLY AND KENT WERE TURNED OVER BY THE ELN TO A COMMISSION MADE
UP OF OFFICIALS OF THE ANTIOQUIA REGIONAL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
AND MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION IN A REGION NEAR COCORNA,
80 KM SOUTHEAST OF MEDELLIN.

WITH MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, WITH
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT] [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE BELIEVE THAT THE
ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA WILL MARK A NEW PHASE IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
SITUATION.  THINGS WILL NOT BE THE SAME IN THAT NEIGHBORING NATION AND
I BELIEVE THAT THE EVOLUTION WILL FAVOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE AT
THE REGIONAL LEVEL.  MOREOVER, THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS AT THE WORLD
LEVEL THAT ALSO ALLOW US TO HAVE HOPE.  LET US NOT FORGET THAT THE
UNITED NATIONS PARTICULARLY IS STRIVING TO ORGANIZE A NEW ROUND OF
TALKS.  THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE BEING SET SO
THAT PEACE MAY BE ACHIEVED THIS YEAR.  THE CHURCH URGES THOSE WHO HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS DECISION TO DO IT AND THUS PAY HOMAGE TO OUR
ARCHBISHOP MSGR [OSCAR ARNULFO] ROMERO, WHO DIED 10 YEARS AGO, AND A
MAN WHO STRUGGLED FOR PEACE, ENGINEER [JOSE NAPOLEON] DUARTE.  THAT
WAS OUR PROPOSAL IN TODAY'S HOMILY.

   [REPORTER] WILL THERE BE ANY DEMAND FOR AN INVESTIGATION OR
RESOLUTION OF THIS CASE EVEN THOUGH MSGR ROMERO WAS ASSASSINATED 10
YEARS AGO?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THE SOLUTION OF THIS CASE
BASICALLY DEPENDS ON A POLITICAL DECISION TO DO IT.  THEREFORE, IT
COULD REMAIN UNSOLVED OR IT COULD BE QUICKLY SOLVED.  WE WOULD LIKE TO
THINK THAT A POLITICAL DECISION WOULD BE ADOPTED, BUT WE HAVE NO
INFORMATION TO INDICATE THAT THIS WILL BE SO.  INSTEAD, IT IS MORE A
WISH, I BELIEVE IT IS A LEGITIMATE WISH, OF ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
THEY WANT THE CASE TO BE SOLVED AND, ABOVE ALL, THEY WANT JUSTICE.
THIS BLOOD SHOULD BEAR FRUIT BY ACHIEVING PEACE AND RESPECT AMONG MEN,
AS A NEW FORM OF SOCIAL COEXISTENCE IN EL SALVADOR.  VIOLENCE SHOULD
NO LONGER EXIST AMONG US AND RECONCILIATION SHOULD QUICKLY BECOME A
REALITY AMONG SALVADORANS.

   [REPORTER] A WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE REVEALED THAT COL.  [GUILLERMO
ALFREDO] BENAVIDES HAS RECENTLY BEEN SEEN AT A SEASIDE [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRIALS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY WILL BE
ANOTHER TEST [PRECEDING WORD IN ENGLISH] FOR SALVADORAN JUSTICE.  IT
HAS FAILED ALMOST ALL OTHER TESTS [PRECEDING WORD IN ENGLISH].  LET US
SEE HOW IT FARES THIS TIME, NOT ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF ITS PRESTIGE, BUT
ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF THE HONOR OF SUCH A MUCH-SACRIFICED PEOPLE AND
THE NEED TO GIVE THE PEOPLE HOPE.  I BELIEVE THAT IMPORTANT STEPS HAVE
BEEN TAKEN, BUT THE TIME HAS COME TO PROVE THAT THESE STEPS WILL LEAD
TO A TRULY JUST CONCLUSION -- OR IF THEY WILL ONCE AGAIN BE CUT SHORT.
LET US HOPE THAT PROGRESS WILL BE ACHIEVED AND, AS WE HAVE STATED ON
OTHER OCCASIONS, THAT THE NAMES OF THE INTELLECTUAL AUTHORS OF THIS
CRIME WILL ALSO BE KNOWN.  [CONTINUED]

CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, WITH UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] MONSIGNOR, REFERRING TO THE WEEK'S
EVENTS, YOU DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE CORRUPTION CASE MENTIONED BY THE
GOVERNMENT.  WHAT IMPLICATIONS MIGHT THIS CASE HAVE?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] I THINK IT IS TOO SOON TO HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT
MAY BE BEHIND THIS NEW SITUATION.  WE MUST WAIT AWHILE FOR SOME TIME
AND LEARN THE DETAILS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE WORSE THINGS WHICH
SHOULD BE SOLVED.  WE WOULD NOT LIKE TO EXPAND ON THIS.  ALL WE WOULD
LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE THINK THERE ARE STILL THINGS WE SHOULD KNOW TO
HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT IS BEHIND THE ANNOUNCEMENT MADE THIS WEEK.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK A FRAUD CAN BE PERPETRATED IN THE
NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE THINK THAT, REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS IN NICARAGUA,
IT WILL REPRESENT A POSITIVE STEP FOR THAT COUNTRY AND ALL OF THE
REGION.  THE NICARAGUAN CHURCH SHARES OUR VIEWS, MEANING THE PASTORS
OF THAT NATION.  THAT IS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE
COULD BE NEAR FOR EL SALVADOR.  HOW NICE IT WOULD BE IF WE AVAILED
OURSELVES OF THIS OPPORTUNITY.

   [REPORTER] MONSIGNOR, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL ASSISTANCE HAS
HELPED CLEAR MANY DEATHS IN EL SALVADOR.  MONSIGNOR ROMERO WAS KILLED
10 YEARS AGO.  DOES THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE
OFFICE HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHO MIGHT BE BEHIND THIS DEATH?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE HAVE SAID MANY TIMES THAT THERE ARE MANY CLUES
WHICH LEAD TO CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS BUT, ACCORDING TO OUR CURRENT LEGAL
SYSTEM, THOSE CLUES CANNOT BE USED AS EVIDENCE.  THUS, ONE CAN BE
CERTAIN OF WHO THE KILLERS ARE AND STILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVE IT.
THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT FRUSTRATIONS CREATED BY OUR LEGAL SYSTEM.  IT
IS OBVIOUS THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL IDEAS, WHICH WE HAVE COMMENTED ON MANY
TIMES, OF WHO THE MONSIGNOR'S KILLERS MAY BE.  ONCE MORE I SAY THAT
THIS IS A MATTER OF MAKING A POLITICAL DECISION, PARTICULARLY TO CLEAR
THE CASE OR LET IT REMAIN UNSOLVED.

   [REPORTER] MONSIGNOR, FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE HAS DIED.  WHAT IS
YOUR OPINION OF DUARTE'S ROLE CONCERNING THE CHURCH?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE WILL STATE IT THIS AFTERNOON DURING THE SPECIAL
MASS WITH ALMOST ALL THE BISHOPS OF EL SALVADOR.  THAT ANSWERS YOUR
QUESTION.  I BELIEVE WE SHOULD SEE THREE LEVELS: THE MAN, THE
CHRISTIAN, AND THE POLITICIAN.  THE LETTER THAT THE ARCHBISHOP SENT TO
DUARTE'S WIDOW, MRS. INES, STATES SOME IDEAS ON THE MAN, THE
CHRISTIAN, AND THE POLITICIAN.  THIS AFTERNOON THE ARCHBISHOP WILL
HAVE A SPECIAL HOMILY AND HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY GIVE A MORE COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION OF THE CHURCH'S VIEWS.  WE CAN ADD THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO
TRIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH HIS CHRISTIAN FAITH.  HE WAS A MAN WHO WAS
OPEN TO THE CHURCH'S PROPOSAL.

HOPEFULES, LIBERALS ERNESTO SAMPER PIZANO AND HERNANDO DURAN AND
CONSERVATIVE RODRIGO LLOREDA CAICEDO, EXPRESSED THEIR WILLINGNESS
TODAY TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE EXTRADITABLES, THE ARMED WING OF THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL, AFTER THE EXTRADITABLES VOICED THEIR DESIRE FOR SUCH
TALKS.

   THE EXTRADITABLES ASKED THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT TODAY TO COME UP
WITH THE MECHANISMS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO TURN THEMSELVES IN
TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, SUCH AS SURRENDERING THEIR WEAPONS, AMMUNITION,
AND EXPLOSIVES, ACCORDING TO A LETTER DELIVERED TO THE GROUP OF
NOTABLES, A GROUP OF MEDIATORS.

   GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS AND OTHER AUTHORITIES REJECTED THE
PROPOSALS MADE BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   THERE WILL BE NO MECHANISMS AND NO COMMISSIONS OTHER THAN THE
COURTS, LEMOS SAID WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE PROPOSAL SENT TO THE GROUP
OF NOTABLES FROM MEDELLIN.

   THE GROUP OF NOTABLES IS COMPOSED OF FORMER LIBERAL PRESIDENTS
ALFONSO LOPEZ AND JULIO CESAR TURBAY, FORMER SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE
PRESIDENT MISAEL PASTRANA, BOGOTA ARCHBISHOP AND CARDINAL MARIO
REVOLLO, AND DIEGO MONTANA, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION
(UP).

   LIBERAL SENATOR SAMPER PIZANO, AFTER LEARNING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S
REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS' PROPOSAL, SAID THAT THERE ARE
CERTAIN WARMONGERING SPIRITS IN THE GOVERNMENT, WHO MUST CHANGE THEIR
ATTITUDE SO AS TO PUT AN END TO THE WAR.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ADDED THAT THE OFFERS MADE BY THE
EXTRADITABLES COULD BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT DISMANTLING THE DE JURE STATE
OR THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS.

   HERNANDO DURAN DESCRIBED THE PROPOSAL AS A STEP FORWARD IN THE
EFFORTS BEING MADE TO NORMALIZE THE SITUATION OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,
AND HE WARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS OFFICERS MUST RESPOND TO
THIS PROPOSAL.

   I BELIEVE THE NEW OFFER TENDS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF DETENTE
BETWEEN THOSE INVOLVED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES AND THE
GOVERNMENT ITSELF, DURAN SAID.

   SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE RODRIGO LLOREDA SAID THAT THE
GOVERNMENT HAS THE OBLIGATION TO RESPOND TO THE EXTRADITABLES, AND HE
ADDED THAT WHEN HE BECOMES PRESIDENT HE WILL DO SO.

   HOWEVER, LLOREDA CAICEDO SAID THAT THE BASIC CONDITIONS FOR
REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON THEIR SURRENDER IS TO HAVE THOSE WHO
COMMITTED CRIMES TURN THEMSELVES IN AND BE JUDGED BY THE COLOMBIAN
JUSTICE SYSTEM.  HE ADDED: IT IS ALSO NECESSARY FOR THEM TO COMPENSATE
THE VICTIMS OF THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS; THERE SHOULD BE GUARANTEES FOR
THE DISMANTLING OF THEIR PRODUCTIVE APPARATUS; THERE SHOULD BE A
SUSPENSION OF THE PROCESSING AND SHIPMENT OF COCAINE ABROAD; AND
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN TO VERIFY THE PROCESS.

WOUNDED DURING AN ATTACK BY A "SHINING PATH" COLUMN.

   TRUCK DRIVERS WHO TRANSPORT FREIGHT TO THE ZONE AND WHO ARRIVED
TODAY FROM MACHENTE (LA MAR PROVINCE), 196 KM NORTHEAST OF AYACUCHO,
HAVE REPORTED THAT THE SHINING PATH ATTACK TOOK PLACE UNEXPECTEDLY ON
FRIDAY NIGHT.  THE DRIVERS REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN DENIED NOR CONFIRMED
BY MILITARY AND POLICE AUTHORITIES.  THEY REPORTED THAT THEY SAW
AMBULANCES CARRYING THE WOUNDED TO THE HOSPITAL IN SAN FRANCISCO, LA

   THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU NOW STANDS AT
MORE THAN 600 THIS YEAR, AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED SINCE
THE "SHINING PATH" BEGAN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980 NOW TOTALS 18,000
ACCORDING TO A CONGRESS COMMISSION WHICH IS STUDYING THE CAUSES OF
VIOLENCE IN PERU.

   POLICE SOURCES TODAY REPORTED IN AYACUCHO, 575 KM SOUTHEAST OF
LIMA, THAT ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY RELATIVES, OVER THE PAST WEEK 30
YOUNG MEN WERE ABDUCTED BY SHINING PATH COLUMNS THAT INTERCEPT
PASSENGER BUSES AND PRIVATE VEHICLES ON THE HIGHWAYS IN THE

   THE SOURCES ADDED THAT THE MAOIST GROUP IS RECRUITING PEOPLE LIKE
THAT FOR THEIR ORGANIZATION, UNDER THREATS OF DEATH.

   THE GOVERNMENT TODAY EXTENDED THE STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR 60 DAYS IN
NINE OF THE 24 DEPARTMENTS INTO WHICH PERU IS POLITICALLY DIVIDED,
AMONG THEM AYACUCHO, BECAUSE OF THE TERRORIST ACTION THAT PERSISTS IN

GIVE AID TO WHATEVER COUNTRY THEY BELIEVE IT IS ADVISABLE TO DO SO.
CERTAINLY THERE IS A NEW SITUATION, AND MANY HAVE EXPRESSED TODAY THAT
THEY ARE WILLING TO HELP NICARAGUA, AS WELL AS PANAMA AND OTHERS.

   [CRISTIANI] I CAN TELL YOU VERY CLEARLY, AND I BELIEVE THAT THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL CAN TESTIFY TO MY STATEMENTS, THAT OUR POSITION HAS
BEEN FITTING AND CONSISTENT AND THAT WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION WE
EXPRESSED TO HIM AT PRESENT.  WE DID PLACE AS A PRE-CONDITION THAT THE
FMLN STOP ALL TERRORIST ACTIONS.  IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE
UNITED NATIONS, AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS CONDEMNED TERRORISM, CANNOT
BACK OUR POSITION, AS WE ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE FMLN TERRORIST
ACTIONS.  BUT WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR POSITION, AND IT IS THE SAME ONE
WE EXPRESSED TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL.

   [ARTEAGA] MR. PRESIDENT, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF THE
MOBILIZATION OF PEASANTS TODAY [WORDS INDISTINCT] COULD BE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE STATE OF SIEGE IS ABOUT TO LIFTED, AS,
SUPPOSEDLY, CONCENTRATIONS AND MOBILIZATIONS ARE PROHIBITED?

   [CRISTIANI] IT DEPENDS ON THE SECURITY SITUATION.  THE STATE OF
SIEGE IS NOT PERMANENT.  WE MUST ANALYZE THE CONTEXT OF THE THREAT
THAT MIGHT EXIST WITH REGARD TO SECURITY.  WE HAVE READ SOME REPORTS,
THOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET CONFIRMED THEM, CLAIMING THAT THE FMLN HAS SAID
THAT IT DOES NOT INTEND TO LAUNCH ANY MORE OFFENSIVES.  IT IS A GOOD
SIGN THAT THE FMLN IS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO A DIALOGUE, AND THIS COULD
PRODUCE THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE.  AS YOU KNOW, THE STATE OF
SIEGE HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED.  IT IS NOT THE SAME.  WE HAVE BEEN
REDUCING IT PROGRESSIVELY AND IT IS NOW STRICTLY WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR
NATIONAL SECURITY.

   [MODERATOR] FRANCISCO ESPINOSA FOR ABC NEWS.

   [ESPINOZA] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I DO NOT KNOW.  I BELIEVE THAT FOR A DIALOGUE TO
TAKE PLACE, THE PRE-CONDITION HAS TO BE MET, REGARDLESS OF NICARGUAN
ELECTION RESULTS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE FMLN.  OUR POSITION IS
BASED ON PRINCIPLES, ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PEOPLE NOT CONTINUE TO
SUFFER THE VIOLENCE GENERATED BY FMLN TERRORISM.  THUS, THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE MET, REGARDLESS OF THE ELECTIONS.  OBVIOUSLY,
I BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS WILL AFFECT THE FMLN
IN SOME MEASURES, AND THIS COULD INCLUDE... [CHANGES THOUGHT] I DO NOT
KNOW.  WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE WHAT POSITION THEY WILL TAKE IN THE
FUTURE, BUT IT COULD BE.  OBVIOUSLY A CHANGE HAS OCCURRED AND WILL
HAVE AN IMPACT AND COULD MOVE THE FMLN TO CHANGE ITS POSITION.  [CONTINUED]

CURTAIL THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE IN TRYING TO
CONTROL AND GOVERN THE COUNTRY, EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT FROM THE
POSITION OF BEING PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY.  SECONDLY, I THINK THAT I
HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION THAT
WILL CHANGE OUR ATTITUDE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH
NICARAGUA, BUT RATHER THE ATTITUDE OF THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH
RESPECT TO AID TO THE FMLN, TO THE MARXIST GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR.
AND IN THIS CASE WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CHANGE TAKING PLACE.
OBVIOUSLY, WE FEEL THAT WITH MRS CHAMORRO AS PRESIDENT OF NICARAGUA
THAT THIS AID WILL STOP AND THEREFORE MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE
RESUMPTION OF NORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, BUT
IT IS THAT ATTITUDE THAT WOULD MAKE A CHANGE AND NOT NECESSARILY THE
RESULT IN ITSELF.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT IF MRS
CHAMORRO REALLY IS IN CONTROL, IN TOTAL CONTROL, ESPECIALLY OF THE
SANDINISTA ARMY, THAT THERE WILL BE A STOP IN AID, AND THEREFORE THE
FMLN WOULD NOT HAVE NICARAGUA'S LOGISTICAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FOR
THEM.  AND THEREFORE, THIS CERTAINLY AFFECTS THEM.

   [REPORTER, IN ENGLISH] I THINK THAT ABOUT ONE WEEK AGO OR TWO WEEKS
AGO IN THE WASHINGTON POST THERE WAS A REPORT THAT COLONEL BENAVIDES
WAS LIVING A RATHER LUXURIOUS LIFE.  I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN
THAT PIECE.  AND ALSO THE U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER HAS SAID THAT
HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME THAT, WELL, THE ARTICLE IMPLIES THAT THERE
WAS SOME PRESSURE, OR THERE WAS SOME PROTECTION COMING FROM THE
TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL
GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] TO PROTECT BENAVIDES, BECAUSE HE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THEIR MEN AND THAT SOME LOWER LIEUTENANTS WERE NOT
GOING TO BE RECEIVING ANY SORT OF PROTECTION AND THEY MAY HAVE TO TAKE
THE FAULT FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  AND ALSO WILLIAM WALKER HAD SAID
THAT HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE TANDONA TO
STEP DOWN AND FOR OTHER OFFICERS TO MOVE UP.  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THAT [WORD INDISTINCT]?  SHOULD THERE BE THAT KIND OF PRESSURE?
SHOULD SOME OF THE GUYS IN THE TANDONA STEP DOWN FROM THEIR POSTS?

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, I THINK THAT IT IS NOT REALLY THE
DETERMINING FACTOR WHETHER YOU BELONG TO A SPECIFIC GRADUATING CLASS
WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES THAT SHOULD BE WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER YOU
CONTINUE OR NOT, OR BE REMOVED OR NOT FROM THE ARMED FORCES.  IT IS
YOUR OWN PERFORMANCE AND YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR THAT SHOULD BE THE
DETERMINING FACTOR.

   SO, THEREFORE, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT THE TANDONA PEOPLE, JUST
FOR BEING MEMBERS OF THE GRADUATING CLASS, [CHUCKLES] THAT ACTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST THEM.  SO I THINK THAT IN THAT CASE THAT IS
NOT REALLY THE POINT.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER CASE, I THINK IT IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY ON HOW IT GOES, WHAT TYPE OF
DEFENSE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ARRAIGNED HAVE.  I THINK THAT THEY ALL
ARE RECEIVING THE LEGAL SUPPORT IN THE CASE AND THE OTHER [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER, IN ENGLISH] AS FOR THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS,
BEFORE YOU LEFT FOR TAIWAN YOU CONDITIONED THE DIALOGUE ON A CEASING
OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE.  TO BE SPECIFIC, DOES THIS MEAN [WORDS
INDISTINCT] ALL ACTS OF VIOLENCE?  AND ALSO, WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT
THIS DIALOGUE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE?

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, IF WE COULD TRY AND PUT INTO ONE
BASKET AND CALL THAT BASKET WITH A NAME WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS,
WE ARE ASKING THE FMLN TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, BECAUSE TERRORIST
ACTIVITY IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  YOU JUST MENTIONED THE
FACT ABOUT A POLE THAT THEY USE FOR ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE
COUNTRY.  JUST LAST NIGHT THEY BLEW UP ONE AND THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE
HURT.  TWO CIVILIANS THAT WERE PASSING BY WERE HURT BY THAT EXPLOSION.
SO THAT IS WHAT HAS TO STOP.  THE FMLN HAS TO STOP ALL TERRORIST
ACTIVITY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE ACTIVITY THAT HURTS THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.  THAT IS NOT MILITARY ACTIVITY.  THAT IS SOMETHING GEARED
AGAINST OR TO CONFRONT THE ARMED FORCES.  SO IT IS THAT VIOLENCE THAT
CAN BE SUMMED UP IN WHAT IS CALLED TERRORISM THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR --
THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT REALLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION OF THE
COUNTRY.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 1 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT
MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS HAS HINTED THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE MARXIST
GUERRILLA GROUP ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION [ELN] WHO HAVE MURDERED THE 77
FOLLOWERS OF THE LEFT-WING PARTY THE PATRIOTIC UNION [UP].

   LEMOS SAID: I CAN EXPECT ANYTHING FROM THE ELN.  HE ADDED THAT HE
BELIEVED THAT THIS GROUP MAKES NO EXCEPTIONS WHEN IT WANTS TO KILL
SOMEONE.

   THE UP HAS BLAMED PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT AND THE
MILITARY FOR THE ANNIHILATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST ITS MEMBERS, DEMANDING
GUARANTEES FOR THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WITH LESS THAN TWO WEEKS
BEFORE THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS TAKE PLACE.

   THE UP MADE THE REPORT FOLLOWING THE MURDER ON 26 FEBRUARY OF
APARTADO MAYOR DIANA CORDOBA SALDARRIAGA -- APARTADO IS LOCATED 480 KM
TO THE NORTHEAST OF BOGOTA -- AND THE MURDER ON THE EVENING OF 27
FEBRUARY OF SIX MORE UP FOLLOWERS IN UNGUIA, A VILLAGE IN CHOCO
DEPARTMENT.  WHEN BLAMING THE ELN, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER SAID THAT
THESE INDIVIDUALS WANT TO BRING ANARCHY AND INSTABILITY TO THE
COUNTRY.  LEMOS ADDED THAT AS PART OF THE ELN'S DESTABLIZATION
CAMPAIGN, IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE
THE MURDER PEOPLE OF OTHER LEFT-WING SECTORS AS THEIR GOAL, AND
ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF THREATS AGAINST VARIOUS
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING HIMSELF.  WHEN REFERRING TO THE UP'S
REPORTS HOLDING THE MILITARY RESPONSIBLE, HE SAID THAT THIS WAS ABSURD
AND ADDED THAT IT IS INTENDED TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATIONS ASTRAY AND TO
TRY TO STOP THE ELECTIONS IN COLOMBIA.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 1 MAR 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT
VINICIO CEREZO HAS ACCUSED U.S. AMBASSADOR THOMAS STROOK OF
INTERFERING IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   "IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY FOR AN AMBASSADOR OF ANY COUNTRY TO OPENLY
INTERFERE IN THE INTERNAL PROBLEMS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY," SAID CEREZO
TODAY IN REFERENCE TO THE U.S. DIPLOMAT.  STROOK HAD EXPRESSED HIS
CONCERN THIS WEEK OVER THE GUATEMALAN HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION AND THE
GUATEMALAN OFFICIALS' INCOMPETENCE IN CONTROLLING THE SITUATION.

   CEREZO REQUESTED THAT STROOK DEFINE HIS STATUS, "WHETHER AS AN
AMBASSADOR OR A PRIVATE PERSON."  HE ALSO ASKED STROOK TO "CONSULT
WITH HIS GOVERNMENT TO FIND OUT IF THIS IS AN OFFICIAL POLICY OR NOT."

   "IF IT IS, WE WOULD HAVE TO OPEN UP A DISCUSSION WITH THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT," SAID THE PRESIDENT.  HE ADDED THAT HE IS HANDLING THE
MATTER WITH "PRUDENCE AND SENSITIVITY, BUT WITH FIRMNESS."

   CEREZO ALSO NOTED THAT IF STROOK "WANTS TO GIVE PERSONAL OPINIONS
ABOUT GUATEMALAN PROBLEMS, HE WILL HAVE TO DO SO INDEPENDENTLY FROM
HIS POSITION AS AMBASSADOR."

   DURING A SPEECH GIVEN TO ROTARY CLUB MEMBERS ON 27 FEBRUARY, THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR CRITICIZED HOW THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT
DEALT WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION.

   THE DIPLOMAT STATED THEN: "I WOULD NOT BE SINCERE IF I TOLD YOU
THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS, AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
NOT SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GUATEMALAN HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION."

   "THE MURDER AND KIDNAPPING OF STUDENTS, POLITICAL LEADERS,
PEASANTS, AND WORKERS HAVE US DEEPLY WORRIED," HE ADDED, NOTING THAT
"THE CONTINOUS REPORTS ABOUT UNKNOWN PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED OR
KIDNAPPED IN THE COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS HAVE NOT ONLY GREATLY DISTURBED
PEOPLE IN GUATEMALA, BUT ALSO THE WORLD OVER."

   STROOK STATED HE WAS SURPRISED THAT IN NONE OF THE CASES HAD THE
GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE AND TAKE TO COURT "THE
VILE AND COWARDLY CRIMINALS WHO HAD COMMITTED THESE ABOMINABLE ACTS."

   DURING HIS SPEECH THE DIPLOMAT ALSO CRITICIZED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING
SITUATION IN GUATEMALA AND "THE SAD SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REALITY" OF
THE COUNTRY, WHERE MOST OF THE COUNTRY'S 9 MILLION INHABITANTS LIVE IN
ABJECT POVERTY.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 3 MAR 90 (CIRCUITO RPC TELEVISION) --
[REPORT] [JULIO MILLER, DIRECTOR OF RPC NEWS DEPARTMENT] [TEXT] DEAR
TELEVISION AUDIENCE, WE BRIEFLY INTERRUPT OUR REGULAR PROGRAMMING TO
OFFER YOU A REPORT OF GENERAL INTEREST.  THE FILM CLIPS WE WILL SEE IN
A FEW MINUTES WERE TAKEN THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY TONIGHT AT THE
RESIDENCY OF THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR IN BELLA VISTA CORREGIMIENTO, EL
CANGREJO NEIGHBORHOOD, WHEN PEOPLE WERE STAGING A PEACEFUL
DEMONSTRATION PROMPTED BY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO
GRANT SAFE-CONDUCTS TO SOME OF THE PANAMANIANS CURRENTLY AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  AMONG THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND WHO WERE GRANTED SAFE-CONDUCTS ARE MARCELA TASON,
FORMER PRIVATE SECRETARY OF OUSTED PANAMANIAN DICTATOR MANUEL ANTONIO.
CAPTAINS HERACLIDES SUCRE, AND GONZALO GONZALEZ, INVOLVED IN THE
KILLING OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI ARE ALSO AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  THE
FILM CLIPS SHOW PART OF THE INTENSE PROTESTS THAT TOOK PLACE NEAR, OR
RATHER ON THE GROUNDS OF THE RESIDENCY OF THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR IN
PANAMA CITY.

   DEMONSTRATORS THREW STONES AT THE EMBASSY WINDOWS AND LATER SET
FIRE TO PART OF THE RESIDENCY INSTALLATIONS.  [CROWD SHOUTS: "THIS
DAMNED THING IS ON FIRE!" THREE TIMES] DURING THE PROTEST NOT ONE OF
THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS ATTEMPTED TO LEAVE THE DIPLOMATIC
QUARTERS.  PERUVIAN DIPLOMATS AND EVEN THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT
SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND WHO WERE AT THE RESIDENCY REMAINED
INSIDE.  PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE UNITS UNSUCESSFULLY TRIED TO CONTROL
DEMONSTRATORS.  DURING THE INCIDENT, A PUBLIC FORCE MEMBER WHO TRIED
TO PREVENT THE INCIDENT WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED.  THESE SCENES WERE
FILMED THIS AFTERNOON AND DURING THE EARLY EVENING HOURS BY OUR
CAMERAMAN JOSE CASIS JR. AND SHOW PART OF THE PROTEST ACTIONS AGAINST
THE RESIDENCY.

   MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, FORMER DEFENSE FORCES PUBLIC
RELATIONS OFFICER, AND THE OTHER CAPTAINS WE MENTIONED BEFORE ARE
CURRENTLY AT THE RESIDENCY.  LET US LISTEN TO PART OF THE STATEMENTS
BY THE WIDOW OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ADELA DE GIROLDI] HE [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] TOLD US
THAT HE WILL TAKE US TO FIRST VICE PRESIDENT AND JUSTICE MINISTER RICARDO
ARIAS CALDERON.

   [REPORTER] DID YOU AGREE TO THAT?

   [GIROLDI] I DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANYONE ELSE KILLED.  I THINK THERE
HAVE BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE KILLED.  I BELIEVE THE PRESSURE WE HAVE
EXERTED IS ENOUGH.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WILL BE YOUR POSITION WHEN YOU TALK TO THE
MINISTER?

   [GIROLDI] I WANT THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTION SO THAT
THE PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES TURN THOSE PEOPLE OVER TO THE PANAMANIANS.  I
THINK IT IS A MATTER OF FIRMLY DEMANDING THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT
TURNS THIS PEOPLE OVER TO PANAMA.

   [REPORTER] HOWEVER, IF THERE IS NOT A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE TODAY,
BY THE AUTHORITIES AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHAT MEASURES WILL YOU ADOPT?
WILL YOU CONTINUE PROTESTING?

   [GIROLDI] OF COURSE WE WILL CONTINUE PROTESTING.  WE WILL CONTINUE
PROTESTING BECAUSE THE ONLY THING WE ARE ASKING FOR IS THAT THESE
PEOPLE SURRENDER TO PANAMANIAN JUSTICE SO THE LAW CAN BE ENFORCED
BECAUSE THEY KILLED....[CHANGES THOUGHT] HERACLIDES SUCRE FIRED AT MY
HUSBAND, HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT IT, HE MACHINEGUNNED MY HUSBAND IN COLD
BLOOD.  OTHER OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WHO TOOK PART IN THE 3 OCTOBER
COUP WERE TORTURED, CUT WITH MACHETES. [END RECORDING]

   THE FOLLOWING FILM CLIPS SHOW A DIALOGUE BETWEEN PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC GUILLERMO ENDARA, VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, AND
THE WIDOWS OF OFFICERS AND MILITARYMEN MISSING OR KILLED ON 3 OCTOBER
1989 IN THE ATTEMPTED COUP.  THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT, THE
VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE DEMONSTRATORS WAS POSITIVE.  DEMONSTRATORS
PROMISED TO REMAIN CALM AND WAIT UNTIL PANAMANIAN JUSTICE DETERMINES
THE RESPONSIBILITY, AND ISSUE SENTENCES FOR THOSE CURRENTLY AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  LATER ON VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, AND
PRESIDENT ENDARA MADE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS.  WE WILL LISTEN FIRST
TO STATEMENTS BY VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON.  [CONTINUED]

[REPORT] [JULIO MILLER, DIRECTOR OF RPC NEWS DEPARTMENT] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARIAS] THE PRESIDENT AND MYSELF
VIGOROUSLY DEPLORE WHAT TRANSPIRED THIS AFTERNOON AT THE PERUVIAN
EMBASSY.  I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY ALONG WITH THE PRESIDENT TO TALK TO
MRS.  GIROLDI, AND SHE ASSURED US THAT HER ONLY INTENTION WAS TO STAGE
A PEACEFUL PROTEST AND AT NO TIME DID THEY PLAN TO INCLUDE ANY VIOLENT
ACTS.  MRS. GIROLDI SAID THAT SHE IS VERY SURPRISED THAT SOME PEOPLE
WHOM SHE DOES NOT KNOW AND HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE PROMOTED VIOLENT
ACTS.  SHE TOLD THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC THAT SHE WILL TALK TO
THE PEOPLE AND TELL THEM THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO VIOLENCE AND THAT
VIOLENCE IS NOT THE AIM.

   THE PRESIDENT AND I APPRECIATE WHAT SHE IS DOING; WE UNDERSTAND
HER PAIN.  WE EXPLAINED TO HER THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT AUTHORIZED
ANY SAFE-CONDUCTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER.
THOSE CASES ARE BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE
MINISTER OF FOREIGN RELATIONS.

   [REPORTER] IS A BREAK IN RELATIONS EXPECTED BETWEEN PANAMA AND
PERU DUE TO THE VIOLENT ACTIONS?

   [ARIAS] NOT AT ALL.  I TALKED TO THE PERUVIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES
AFTER OUR FOREIGN MINISTER TALKED TO HIM.  HE KNOWS THAT THE NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT PROFOUNDLY REGRETS WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED; THAT THE PEOPLE WHO
WERE PROTESTING THERE, SUCH AS MRS GIROLDI, HAD NO PLANS TO CARRY OUT
VIOLENT ACTIONS.  UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE, WHOSE IDENTITY WE WILL TRY TO
DETERMINE, URGED THE THROWING OF FIRE BOMBS AGAINST THE EMBASSY.  THE
FOREIGN MINISTER AND MYSELF EXPRESSED OUR APOLOGIES TO THE PERUVIAN
GOVERNMENT FOR ANY INCONVENIENCES OR INSECURITY FELT BY ITS PERSONNEL.

   [ENDARA] THESE ARE VERY REGRETFUL INCIDENTS.  NOT ONLY A BASIC
COURTESY OF CIVILIZED PEOPLE, THAT IS TO RESPECT THE RESIDENCES OF
OTHER PEOPLE, AND MORE SO WHEN THEY BELONG TO REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER
COUNTRIES, BUT A PRINCIPLE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS BEEN VIOLATED.
THAT PRINCIPLE IS DUE RESPECT FOR DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS.

   WHAT REALLY WORRIES US ABOUT THIS INCIDENT IS A REPORT GIVEN TO US
BY THE ORGANIZERS OF DEMONSTRATIONS AT THE EMBASSY.  SPECIFICALLY, BY
THE WIDOWS OF MEN MURDERED BY THOSE WHO ARE REFUGED IN THAT EMBASSY;
THE WIDOW OF MAJOR GIROLDI WAS HERE, AND SHE TOLD US THAT ALL HER
ACTIONS AT THE EMBASSY HAVE BEEN PEACEFUL.

   SHE TOLD US THAT TODAY THEY NOTICED THAT TOTALLY UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE
WERE PRESENT AND THESE PEOPLE PROVOKED THE VIOLENCE; THEY INSTIGATED
THE VIOLENCE.  OBVIOUSLY, THERE CERTAIN GROUPS ARE SEEKING TO SPOIL
OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE DEMOCRACY.  THEY WANT TO PREVENT THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WITH JUSTICE AND LIBERTY AT ALL
COSTS.

   I BELIEVE THAT THIS INCIDENT MUST BE DENOUNCED BEFORE THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL OF THE NATION.  HE SHOULD INVESTIGATE THESE PROVOCATIONS.
NEVERTHELESS, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH URGES THE CITIZENS TO NOT ALLOW
PEOPLE TO PROVOKE THEM INTO PARTICIPATING IN VIOLENT ACTIONS SUCH AS
ONE WHICH OCCURRED TODAY.  THE CITIZENS MUST NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO
EXPLOIT THE FEELINGS THAT ALL PANAMNIANS FEEL TOWARDS CRIMINALS AND
PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AND WHO ARE HOLED UP IN EMBASSIES
SUCH AS THIS ONE; WE URGE CITIZENS TO AVOID BEING PROVOKED. [END RECORDING]

   BOGOTA, 4 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] THE AUTHORITIES
AND SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY THE SHOCKING WAVE OF
KIDNAPPINGS CARRIED OUT THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY BY THE
SELF-STYLED ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION, ELN.  OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS, THE GROUP HAS KIDNAPPED 20 PEOPLE.

   AMONG THE VICTIMS OF THE ELN'S SO-CALLED CAMILIST UNION ARE FOUR
MAYORS, TWO DEPUTIES, SIX EXECUTIVES, CATTLEMEN, BUSINESSMEN, FARMERS,
AND A POLICEMAN.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, 12 KIDNAPPINGS TOOK PLACE OVER THE
PAST 18 HOURS.  IN CESAR DEPARTMENT, MEMBERS OF THE CAMILIST UNION
KIDNAPPED LIBERAL DEPUTY DARIO QUINTERO PATINO, 42, IN THE DOWNTOWN
SECTION OF AGUACHICA MUNICIPALITY.  NEWSMAN EMILIANO J. PACHECO, WHO
WORKS FOR THE "ADVANCES OF CESAR" NEWSCAST OF THE ONDAS DEL CESAR
RADIO STATION, WAS KIDNAPPED ALONG WITH THE POLITICAL LEADER.

MEMBERS, KIDNAPPED CATTLEMAN MANUEL NARCISO MARTINEZ JAROCA, NEPHEW OF
ANIBAL MARTINEZ ZURETA, CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR OF VALLEDUPAR AND FORMER

AGUDELO WAS KIDNAPPED BY MEMBERS OF THE CAMILIST UNION AS HE WAS ON
HIS WAY TO FRAGUAS CORREGIMIENTO IN REMEDIOS, ANTIOQUIA, TO CASH A
CHECK.

   THE AUTHORITIES AND SECRET SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ANNOUNCED THAT
INTENSIVE OPERATIONS ARE UNDERWAY IN AN EFFORT TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES
ALIVE.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEY URGED LOCAL OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL
LEADERS TO REFRAIN FROM TRAVELLING ALONE TO AVOID FALLING INTO THE
HANDS OF THE GUERRILLAS.

   WITH THIS SHOCKING WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS, THE NUMBER OF SUCH ACTIONS
IN COLOMBIA SO FAR IN 1990 HAS INCREASED TO 120.

   CLANDESTINE, 6 MAR 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [JOINT
COMMAND OF THE MODESTO RAMIREZ CENTRAL FRONT] [TEXT] ONE MILITARY
HELICOPTER WAS SHOT DOWN TODAY WHILE ANOTHER ONE WAS DAMAGED IN
QUEBRANDA HONDA NEAR CHALATENANGO CITY.  THEREFORE, THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WISHES TO INFORM OUR
PEOPLE OF THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT CLASH TOOK PLACE DURING A MILITARY OPERATION
WHICH THE DM-1 [MILITARY DETACHMENT 1] IS CARRYING OUT IN THAT SECTOR.

   2.  EARLY IN THE MORNING WE FOUGHT WITH DM-1 TROOPS, WHO WERE
SUPPORTED BY SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS.

   3.  WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, OUR ANTI-AIRCRAFT UNITS FIRED ON TWO
MILITARY HELICOPTERS THAT HAD FIRED ROCKETS AND MACHINEGUNNED THE
AREA.  OUR UNITS SHOT DOWN ONE AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGED ANOTHER
HELICOPTER.

   4.  THESE ACTIONS TOOK PLACE NEAR THE CAPITAL OF CHALATENANGO
DEPARTMENT, AND NOT NEAR THE GUANCORA LAND SETTLEMENT.

   5.  LATER, WE LEARNED FROM PUBLIC REPORTS THAT ONE OF THE
HELICOPTERS WAS CARRYING A TEAM OF JOURNALISTS AND ATTORNEY GENERAL
MAURICIO COLORADO ALONG WITH THE TROOPS.  TO THAT EFFECT, WE REGRET
THE INJURIES INFLICTED ON THE JOURNALISTS, TO WHOM WE REITERATE OUR
RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY SHOULD NOT TRAVEL ON ANY MILITARY VEHICLES OR
AIRCRAFT.  WE EXTEND THIS WARNING TO ALL CIVILIANS AND GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS.

ATTACK AGAINST A HELICOPTER IN WHICH ATTORNEY GENERAL MAURICIO
COLORADO WAS ONE OF THE PASSENGERS, OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE NOTED,
ADDING THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS UNHURT.

   ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA), MEMBERS OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) MACHINEGUNNED THE
HELICOPTER AS IT WAS FLYING TO THE TOWN OF GUANCORITA IN NORTHERN
CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.  THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE WHEN THE HELICOPTER
WAS FLYING LOW CLOSE TO ITS DESTINATION, IN AN AREA WITH A HEAVY
GUERRILLA PRESENCE, THE MILITARY SOURCES SAID.

   THE SAME SOURCES ADDED THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS RETINUE
WERE GOING TO BE PRESENT AT THE DISINTERMENT OF THE BODIES OF THE
VICTIMS OF AN AIR FORCE BOMBING IN THAT DEPARTMENT THREE WEEKS AGO.
THE SOURCES DID NOT INDICATE THE PRECISE NUMBER OF PERSONS TRAVELING
ABOARD THE HELICOPTER, BUT DID SAY THAT THE CONDITION OF FOUR OF THE
SIX PERSONS INJURED, TWO SOLDIERS AND TWO NEWSMEN, WAS SERIOUS.  THE
WOUNDED REPORTERS ARE CAMERAMAN MANUEL DIAZ AND SOUND MAN WILLIAM
MADRID, OF LOCAL TELEVISION STATION TELECORPORACION SALVADORENA (TCS).

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 MAR 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] MILITARY SOURCES REPORTED
TODAY THAT FIGHTING BROKE OUT ON THE NIGHT OF 5 MARCH IN THE WAR-TORN
CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT TO THE NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE
GUERRILLAS SUFFERED EIGHT CASUALTIES.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE CLASHES TOOK
PLACE NEAR SAN ISIDRO LABRADOR, WHERE THREE GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND
FIVE OTHERS WERE WOUNDED.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN), WHICH HAS
BEEN FIGHTING THE U.S.-BACKED ARMY FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, HAS
TRADITIONALLY MAINTAINED A HIGH PROFILE IN STRATEGIC AREAS OF
CHALATENANGO.

   MEANWHILE, URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS HARASSED TROOPS BELONGING TO
THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE LAST NIGHT AT THE MARIONA PENITENTIARY,
LOCATED ON THE NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, APPARENTLY LEAVING
NO CASUALTIES.

   ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS, WHICH MAINTAIN A COUNTERINSURGENCY
OPERATION AT THE FOOTHILLS OF GUAZAPA HILL, TO THE NORTH OF SAN
SALVADOR, CONFISCATED WAR MATERIEL THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAD HIDDEN
UNDERGROUND.

   IN ANOTHER TURN OF EVENTS, FMLN SAPPERS WHO CONTINUOUSLY SABOTAGE
THE ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM DESTROYED SEVERAL HIGH-VOLTAGE POSTS IN LA
LIBERTAD AND CABANAS DEPARTMENTS IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY,
AND IN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.

   THERE WERE WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES IN THE THREE DEPARTMENTS WHILE
TECHNICIANS OF THE STATE-RUN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANIES REPAIRED THE
DAMAGE.

   THE ARMY AND SECURITY CORPS DEPLOYED HEAVY PATROLS IN SAN SALVADOR
AND IN CITIES IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR TO TRY AND COUNTER THE WAVE OF
ATTACKS.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 6 MAR 90 (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] NOW, JUST LIKE
13 YEARS AGO WHEN A DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION WAS INSTALLED IN THE WHITE
HOUSE, THE RELATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE PARTICULARLY
TENSE, AND TODAY, JUST LIKE THEN, THE REASON FOR THE TENSION IN THEIR
BILATERAL RELATIONS IS THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION, BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE
REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE BUSH, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT OF VINICIO CEREZO DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH POLITICAL WILL TO
NEUTRALIZE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE AFFECTING THE SECURITY OF CITIZENS AND
INDIVIDUAL GUARANTEES.

   IN MARCH 1977, NEWLY INSTALLED U.S. PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER DEMANDED
THAT THE REGIME HEADED BY GENERAL KJELL LAUGERUD RECTIFY A DOMESTIC
POLICY THAT, ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WAS CHARACTERIZED BY
REPRESSIVE PRACTICES AGAINST THE OPPOSITION AND PEASANT AND LABOR
GROUPS.  THE GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES REACTED BY REJECTING U.S.
MILITARY AID.  THE SAME POSITION WAS ADOPTED, AMID VERY SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCES, BY THE MILITARY GOVERNMENTS OF JORGE VIDELA IN
ARGENTINA AND AUGUSTO PINOCHET IN CHILE.

   RELATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND WASHINGTON CONTINUED TO BE TORTUOUS
DURING THE BALANCE OF THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION AND ONLY IMPROVED,
RELATIVELY SPEAKING, WHEN REPUBLICAN RONALD REAGAN TOOK OFFICE IN
1981.  HOWEVER, ONLY YEARS LATER -- WITH THE COMMITMENT TO
DEMOCRATIZATION BY DE FACTO MILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT LED THE COUNTRY
FROM 1982 AND 1985 -- WAS THERE A CONCILIATORY ATTITUDE BETWEEN
GUATEMALA AND THE UNITED STATES THAT BROUGHT ABOUT QUITE HARMONIOUS
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF PRESIDENT CEREZO AND PRESIDENTS
REAGAN AND BUSH UNTIL MID-1989.

   ON 27 FEBRUARY U.S. AMBASSADOR THOMAS STROOK CRITICIZED THE
GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' FAILURE TO PURSUE THE AUTHORS OF MURDERS AND
OF KIDNAPPINGS OF POLITICAL, STUDENT, AND LABOR LEADERS, AND THUS
WORSENED AN ATMOSPHERE OF CONFRONTATION THAT HAD RESURFACED ABOUT SIX
MONTHS AGO WHEN AMBASSADOR STROOK, WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA,
OBJECTED TO THE APPOINTMENT OF COLONEL HUGO MORAN CARRANZA, FORMER
DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL, TO THE POST OF MANAGER OF THE
SANTO TOMAS DE CASTILLA PORT ENTERPRISE.  THE AMBASSADOR JUSTIFIED HIS
OBJECTION BY CLAIMING THAT ASPECTS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL DRUG
TRAFFICKING HAD TO BE RESOLVED FIRST.

   ON 6 MARCH, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD
HARDENED ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE GUATEMALAN REGIME AND THAT THIS
ATTITUDE CONTRASTS WITH A TOLERANT POSTURE EXHIBITED TOWARD PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATIONS IN GUATEMALA:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] THEY HAVE HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE COURTS
SITUATION.  THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND AS A
RESULT OF THE UN ACTION A DRAFT PROCEDURAL LAW WILL BE SUBMITTED.
THIS SHOULD BE APPROVED AND PROCEEDINGS SHOULD IMPROVE IN GUATEMALA IN
ABOUT [WORD INDISTINCT] YEARS.

   HOWEVER, WE ARE DEALING WITH LONG-TERM EFFORT.  WE HAVE MADE
INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES FOR ONLY FOUR YEARS.  I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT
THE U.S. ATTITUDE TOWARD A COUNTRY THAT IS MAKING EFFORTS TO MOVE
FORWARD IS UNFAIR AND OVERLY CRITICAL.  IT IS BEING MORE CRITICAL OF
THE CURRENT GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT THAN IT EVER WAS TOWARD PAST
DICTATORSHIPS.  THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY HARSHER IN
CRITICIZING THE CURRENT GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT [WORDS INDISTINCT]
DEMOCRACY THAN PAST DICTATORIAL GOVERNMENTS, TO WHICH THE UNITED
STATES, IN CERTAIN CASES, WAS AN ACCOMPLICE BY SAYING NOTHING [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  [END RECORDING]

   ONLY HOURS AFTER THE PRESIDENT MADE THESE STATEMENTS, THE U.S.
EMBASSY IN GUATEMALA ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE STATING THAT IF THE UNITED
STATES ABSTAINED FROM VOICING ITS CONCERN OVER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, IT
WOULD INDEED BE ACTING AS AN ACCOMPLICE.  THE COMMUNIQUE CITES
STATEMENTS MADE ON 5 MARCH IN WASHINGTON BY STATE DEPARTMENT
SPOKESWOMAN MARGARET TUTWILLER THAT U.S. AMBASSADOR STROOK, IN HIS
CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT BUSH'S PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE, HAS ON MANY
OCCASIONS TOLD TOP GUATEMALAN OFFICIALS, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, THAT
THOSE WHO COMMIT VIOLENT ACTS MUST BE TURNED OVER TO JUSTICE.

   STROOK IS CURRENTLY IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE WAS RECALLED BY THE
STATE DEPARTMENT FOR CONSULTATIONS.  ACCORDING TO THE DIPLOMATIC
MISSION, THE AMBASSADOR'S STATEMENTS ACCURATELY REFLECT THE PERMANENT
U.S. POSITION OF CONSIDERING HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN ISSUE THAT MUST BE
TREATED AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1155 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SANTIAGO, 6 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] CHILEAN PRESIDENT-ELECT PATRICIO
AYLWIN TODAY CONDITIONED THE REESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
WITH CUBA TO THAT COUNTRY'S SUSPENSION OF ITS MILITARY, POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC SUPPORT TO CHILE'S MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR)
TERRORIST GROUP. IN REMARKS TO EFE, AYLWIN EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION
OVER THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO ATTEND THE CHILEAN
PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION ON 11 MARCH. HE ALSO NOTED THAT LA PAZ MUST
FIRST RESTORE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CHILE TO HOLD TALKS ON
BOLIVIA'S DESIRE FOR AN OUTLET TO THE SEA.

   AYLWIN STATED THAT CUBA'S SUSPENSION OF ITS SUPPORT TO THE FPMR IS
"A SINE QUA NON CONDITION" FOR RESUMING RELATIONS, WHICH WERE SEVERED
IN 1973 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MILITARY COUP IN CHILE. "WE WANT TO
MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH EVERY COUNTRY," THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT-ELECT
TOLD EFE.  HE ADDED: "IT WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR LATIN AMERICA IF CUBA
COULD EFFECTIVELY REJOIN US AT THIS TIME (...) IN WHICH, FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN MANY YEARS, PERHAPS IN DECADES, THERE WILL BE DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENT."

   AYLWIN ADDED: "WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK CUBA TO MAKE IT QUITE CLEAR
THAT IT WILL REFRAIN FROM ANY ACT OF INTERFERENCE AND FROM SUPPLYING
ANY AID TO CHILEAN TERRORIST GROUPS."

   THE FPMR, WHICH EMERGED IN DECEMBER 1983, IS MADE UP OF MILITANTS
FROM COMMUNIST YOUTH GROUPS AND OTHER EXTREME LEFT ORGANIZATIONS AND
YOUNG EXILES WHO HAVE RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY.  THE FPMR MADE
HEADLINES IN AUGUST 1986 WITH THE DISCOVERY OF AN ARSENAL THAT HAD
BEEN CLANDESTINELY SHIPPED INTO NORTHERN CHILE.  THE FPMR WAS ALSO IN
THE NEWS WITH THE UNSUCCESSFUL 7 SEPTEMBER 1986 ATTACK ON CHILE'S
CHIEF EXECUTIVE, GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET, WHICH CLAIMED THE LIVES OF
FIVE OF PINOCHET'S BODYGUARDS.

   AYLWIN ALSO STATED THAT THE REESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH
BOLIVIA "IS BLOCKED BY THE BOLIVIAN DECISION TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH
OUR COUNTRY."  COMMENTING ON BOLIVIA'S ASPIRATION FOR AN OUTLET TO THE
SEA, AYLWIN SAID: "WE CANNOT ACCEPT CONDITIONS FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT
OF RELATIONS.  IF WE HAVE RELATIONS, WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANYTHING AND
FIND SOLUTIONS TO ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS."  AYLWIN CONTINUED: "IF WE DO
NOT MAINTAIN RELATIONS, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE."

   AYLWIN ALSO COMMENTED ON PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA'S DECISION
TO ATTEND THE CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION.  THIS WILL BE THE
FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 100 YEARS (SINCE THE 1879 WAR OF THE PACIFIC
IN WHICH CHILE FOUGHT AGAINST PERU AND BOLIVIA) THAT A PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT WILL VISIT CHILE, A GESTURE WITH "HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE" FOR
AYLWIN.

   THE LEGACY OF THE CHILEAN-PERUVIAN WAR HAS NOT YET DISAPPEARED
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES SHARE COMMON INTERESTS AND
HAVE MAINTAINED FRIENDLY RELATIONS IN RECENT YEARS. AYLWIN DESCRIBED
THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO ATTEND HIS INAUGURATION "AS A GESTURE
WHICH, IN ADDITION TO GREATLY HONORING ME, I MUST SEE AS VERY
PROMISING FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES."

   [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] COUNTRY IS WILLING TO PARTICIPATE "IN EVERY
STAGE." COMMENTING SPECIFICALLY ON THE GROUP OF EIGHT, AYLWIN NOTED
THAT THIS GROUP MAY BECOME A LARGER LATIN AMERICAN ORGANIZATION.  IN
AYLWIN'S OPINION, THE GROUP OF EIGHT -- WHICH IS MADE UP OF ARGENTINA,
BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, PERU, URUGUAY, VENEZUELA, AND PANAMA (WHICH
IS CURRENTLY EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF ITS DOMESTIC POLITICAL SITUATION) --
EMERGED PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS IN SOME LATIN
AMERICAN COUNTRIES.

   NOW THAT DEMOCRACY HAS SPREAD TO VIRTUALLY ALL LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES, THE GROUP OF EIGHT COULD BECOME "THE SEED FOR A BROADER
ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE THE REASONS THAT PREVENTED OTHER COUNTRIES FROM
JOINING HAVE GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED."

   BOGOTA, 8 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), ONE
OF THE MAIN COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS, DELIVERED THEIR WEAPONS
TODAY TO A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL (IS) SPECIAL COMMISSION AT THE M-19

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] HERE IS AN EXCERPT
OF WHAT AN OFFICIAL REPORT BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE, ARENA, REGARD AS A COMPLETELY RECKLESS PUBLICATION AND WITHOUT ANY
CREDIBILITY.

   THE COMMUNIQUE IS BY THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS, AND AN EXCERPT OF
IT RELEASED A FEW HOURS AGO THROUGH VARIOUS LOCAL AND FOREIGN MEDIA
READS AS FOLLOWS:

   TO THE NEWS MEDIA, POLITICAL PARTIES, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, UNIONS,
WORKERS, PEASANT ORGANIZATIONS, AND DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS: THE
UNDERSIGNED, SUPREME COMMANDERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS WHO MET ON 13
FEBRUARY SOMEWHERE IN SAN SALVADOR IN AN EXTRAORDINARY ASSEMBLY AND
WHO REPRESENT ALL OUR CHAPTERS AND CADRES SCATTERED IN THE COUNTRY'S
14 DEPARTMENTS, STRONGLY AND MANFULLLY DECLARE: SENTENCE UNFINISHED AS
HEARD

   THE DOCUMENT, WITH PARAGRAPHS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE AUTHORS, STATES
THAT THE OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS' MURDERS
MUST BE RELEASED BEFORE HOLY WEEK, OR ELSE THEY WILL PHYSICALLY
ELIMINATE ALL CIVILIAN AND RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE
GOVERNMENT, WHO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS CASE.

   THE COMMUNIQUE NOTES: NEVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF EL SALVADOR
HAS ANY OFFICER BEEN TRIED, AND AS WE HAVE LEARNED, NO SOLDIER HAS
BEEN, AND MUST NOT BE, SUBJECT TO ANY LAW OF THE REPUBLIC.  IT ADDS:
KEEP IN MIND, LEST WE BEGIN TO CARRY OUT REPRISALS, THAT THROUGHOUT
OUR HISTORY WE HAVE ALWAYS GONE UNPUNISHED, A PRIVILEGE THAT WE ARE
NOT READY TO LOSE.

   A STATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARENA, WHICH ARE MENTIONED IN THE
COMMUNIQUE, TOTALLY REJECTED THE DOCUMENT THAT, WE REPEAT, WAS
DISTRIBUTED IN SAN SALVADOR A FEW HOURS AGO.  IN A WARNING TO THE NEWS
MEDIA, THE AUTHORS SAY THAT THE MEDIA ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE THIS
COMMUNIQUE KNOWN, OR ELSE THEIR INSTALLATIONS AND STAFF WILL SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR DISOBEDIENCE.  THE AUTHORS OF THE COMMUNIQUE
ALSO REFER TO A NEWSPAPER THAT THEY REGARD AS THEIR OFFICIAL
MOUTHPIECE, AND THEY WARN THAT, FOR THE GOOD AND SECURITY OF THE
COUNTRY AND THE FATHERLAND, THIS NEWSPAPER MUST BE CLEARER IN
IDENTIFYING PEOPLE AND FIGURES WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN JUDGED AND
CONDEMNED IN ORDER TO CAPTURE AND DESTROY THEM.

   MEANWHILE, TERMING THE COMMUNIQUE AS RECKLESS AND THE ENTIRE
SITUATION AS DESPICABLE, THE GOVERNMENT AND ARENA REJECT ANY TIES TO
ANY DEATH SQUADS.

   THE COMMUNIQUE BY THE SELF-STYLED DEATH SQUADS IS SIGNED BY AQUILES
BAIRES [LEADER OF THE SECRET ANTICOMMUNIST ARMY], THE MAXIMILIANO
HERNANDEZ MARTINEZ SQUAD [ESCUADRON MAXIMILIANIO HERNANDEZ MARTINEZ],

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [TEXT] GOOD EVENING,
LISTENERS.  IN ORDER TO BRING CALM TO ALL SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTS, AND ALSO
TO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY, WE INFORM YOU THAT A FEW
MINUTES AGO, EXPERTS OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY OF EL SALVADOR, CAES,
CONFIRMED THAT DESPITE A FEW ATTACKS ON SOME POWER TOWERS, ENERGY SERVICE IS
COMPLETELY NORMAL THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR.  THE CAES EXPERTS ADDED THAT
THERE WAS A SHORT POWER OUTAGE IN LARGE PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT THAT THE
SITUATION IS BACK TO NORMAL NOW.  THE EXPERTS SAID THAT THEY ALSO DETECTED
SOME DAMAGE IN THE ENERGY SYSTEM.

   AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ON THIS RADIO STATION EARLIER, HARASSMENT
OPERATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT IN SEVERAL PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR AT
APPROXIMATELY 2115 TONIGHT.

   FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] LEFTIST GUERRILLAS
ATTACKED MILITARY POSITIONS IN SAN RAMON, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, MEJICANOS,
AND CUSCATANCINGO TONIGHT.  IT WAS SAID THAT A NUMBER OF FMLN MEMBERS
CONDUCTED LIGHTNING ATTACKS ON THOSE MILITARY POSITIONS AND THEN
WITHDREW FROM THE AREA IMMEDIATELY.

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE ATTACK IN SAN RAMON LASTED APPROXIMATELY
15 MINUTES, AFTER WHICH THE ARMY TOOK CONTROL OF THAT ENTIRE AREA.
REPORTS STATE THAT AFTER THE ATTACK IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE THE GUERRILLAS
MOVED TOWARD EL CARMEN HILL AND COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION MEMBERS
WERE PURSUING THE REBEL COLUMNS THERE.  IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE
REBELS ATTACKED MILITARY POSITIONS IN CUSCATANCINGO AND ON EL FITO
STREET, MEJICANOS JURISDICTION.

   A FEW MINUTES AGO IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SHOOTING ENDED IN
AYUTUXTEPEQUE AND IN THE OTHER PARTS OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, AND
THAT AN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER IS OVERFLYING THE AREA TO COUNTERACT THE
REBELS' MOVEMENT.

   IT WAS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT ENERGY HAS BEEN RESTORED IN SOME PARTS
OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT NOT IN CUSCATANCINGO AND CIUDAD DELGADO, WHERE
THE GUERRILLAS BLEW UP SEVERAL POWER TOWERS.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE [COPREFA] HAS ONLY STATED THAT NO
CASUALTIES ARE REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THESE HARASSMENT OPERATIONS,
ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  COPREFA INDICATED THAT 1ST
INFANTRY BRIGADE MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN STRATEGIC POSITIONS
THROUGHOUT NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AND THAT THESE MEN ARE SUPPORTED BY
SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS, WHICH ARE LIGHTING THE AREA WITH
SPOTLIGHTS AND FLARES.

   ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL REPORT, THE SITUATION AT THIS TIME IS
COMPLETELY NORMAL IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, DESPITE THE PANIC THAT
SPREAD AT APPROXIMATELY 2115 WHEN HEAVY SHOOTING, MACHINEGUN FIRE, AND
THE DETONATION OF POWERFUL BOMBS WERE HEARD.

   NEITHER COPREFA NOR THE SPECIFIC MILITARY POSITIONS THAT WERE
ATTACKED HAVE REPORTED CASUALTIES SO FAR.  IT WAS SAID THAT TOMORROW
MORNING COPREFA WILL ISSUE AN OVERALL REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THESE
CLASHES.  SALVADORAN RED CROSS SOURCES SAID TONIGHT THAT THEY DO NOT
KNOW OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTY RESULTING FROM THESE ARMED INCIDENTS.

   THIS HAS BEEN A REPORT ON THE ATTACKS CARRIED OUT IN NORTHERN SAN
SALVADOR TONIGHT.  WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN US TOMORROW FOR A REPORT ON
THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVENTS.  


DEV-MUC3-1159 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAR 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI HAS ACCUSED THE GUERRILLAS OF MAINTAINING "INFLEXIBLE
STANDS" REGARDING RESUMING THE DIALOGUE THAT WILL ALLOW ENDING THE
10-YEAR-OLD ARMED CONFLICT.

   IN AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT TODAY, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) DOES NOT WANT TO
LISTEN TO THE CRIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REJECTING VIOLENCE."

   FOR CRISTIANI, THE FMLN "IS THE ONLY PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
TERRORIST ACTIONS, AS IT MAINTAINS INFLEXIBLE STANDS" ABOUT THE PEACE
PROCESS.

   THE REBELS, WHO ROSE UP IN ARMS 10 YEARS AGO, RECENTLY SAID THAT AS
LONG AS THERE IS NO TRUE ATTEMPT TO BRING ABOUT A DEMOCRATIZATION, ITS
ARMED STRUGGLE "CONTINUES BEING AS LEGITIMATE AS IT WAS 10 YEARS AGO."

   FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 1989 OFFENSIVE, THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND
THE FMLN ASKED UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR TO
INTERCEDE AND SEEK AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL BRING ABOUT THE PEACE TALKS.

   HEEDING THIS REQUEST, PEREZ DE CUELLAR APPOINTED DIPLOMAT ALVARO DE
SOTO AS HIS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE.  AS OF LAST DECEMBER, DE SOTO HAS
BEEN MEETING WITH BOTH PARTIES, THE CHURCH, AND SALVADORAN POLITICAL
SECTORS.

   THE CRISTIANI STATEMENT TERMS AS "FALSE" THE CHARGES RAISED BY THE
FMLN TO THE EFFECT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HINDERING
THE RESUMPTION OF THE PEACE EFFORTS.

   "PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS REITERATED TO MR. DE SOTO A TRUE
WILLINGNESS TO SEEK THROUGH A SERIOUS DIALOGUE AND NOT A TACTICAL OR
MUCH LESS PROPAGANDISTIC DIALOGUE THE SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT,"
THE DOCUMENT POINTS OUT.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT THANKED DE SOTO'S "INTEREST AND HARD
WORK" IN COMPLYING WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL'S COMMITMENT OF
SEEKING PEACE IN THE COUNTRY.

THEY BROKE UP A REBEL COLUMN THAT OPERATED IN BOTH COUNTRIES.

   THE MILITARY OPERATIVE LED TO THE CAPTURE OF 12 ELN MEMBERS WHO HAD
KIDNAPPED SEVERAL CATTLE BREEDERS AND PROPERTY-OWNERS IN THE BORDER

THE VENEZUELAN TOWN OF RUASDUALITO BY MEMBERS OF THE VENEZUELAN
JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE (PTJ), WHILE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES CAPTURED
11 OTHERS IN THE EASTERN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT.

   THE ELN, THE MOST RADICAL OF ALL THE ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN
COLOMBIA, HAS THREATENED TO SABOTAGE NEXT SUNDAY'S MUNICIPAL AND
LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS.

   OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, ELN FRONTS HAVE KIDNAPPED SEVERAL MAYORS,

COLOMBIA: DRUG KINGPINS SOLE MEMBERS OF 'EXTRADITABLES'

   THE 22 JANUARY EDITION OF THE BOGOTA DAILY EL TIEMPO PUBLISHED
INFORMATION FROM COLOMBIAN POLICE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS AND STATE
SECURITY INTERCEPTS IDENTIFYING DRUG KINGPINS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUE AS THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED
"EXTRADITABLES."  THIS PRESS NOTE PROVIDES HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 22
JANUARY ARTICLE.

   DRUG BARONS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUE, WHO
ARE REPUTED TO BE THE BRAINS BEHIND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S PLAN TO
SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE NATIONAL
POLICE AND STATE SECURITY AS THE ONLY ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
COMMUNIQUES SENT BY THE SO-CALLED "EXTRADITABLES," ACCORDING TO THE EL
TIEMPO ARTICLE.

   STATE SECURITY RECOGNI ED ESCOBAR'S VOICE IN A CONVERSATION
INTERCEPTED DURING A ROUTINE RADIO SCANNING OPERATION, WHICH REVEALED
THAT THE CARTEL WAS PLANNING TO SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT.  ESCOBAR
WAS ACTING AS THE CARTEL'S INTERMEDIARY IN CHARGE OF CONTACTING LAWYER
GUIDO PARRA, THE LIAISON BETWEEN THE CARTEL AND HIGH LEVEL GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS.  ESCOBAR DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE OFFICIALS
INVOLVED.

   A NATIONAL POLICE INTELLIGENCE REPORT SAYS THAT OCHOA AND ESCOBAR
FIND THEMSELVES IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION BECAUSE OTHER TRAFFICKER
GROUPS HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR SUPPORT AS THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR KIDNAPPINGS AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTS THEY HAVE NOT
PERPETRATED.  THE REPORT FURTHER INDICATES THAT ESCOBAR, PRESSURED BY
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN ANTIOQUIA, "WAS FORCED TO ORDER THE KIDNAPPINGS
OF ALVARO DIEGO MONTOYA, (SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE
PRESIDENCY) AND PATRICIA ECHEVARRIA (SISTER OF PRESIDENT BARCO'S
SON-IN-LAW) AND HER DAUGHTER."  THESE HIGH PROFILE HOSTAGES SERVED AS
A "PROTECTIVE SHIELD," ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE.

   SPOKESMEN FOR THE INTELLIGENCE CORPS ARE QUOTED AS SAYING THAT
ESCOBAR KNEW THAT BY TAKING HOSTAGE THE SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL
OF THE PRESIDENCY, HE COULD SUCCESSFULLY EXERT THE PRESSURE HE NEEDED
TO ACT IN THE NAME OF THE "EXTRADITABLES."  PROBLEMS BEGAN TO SURFACE
SOON AFTER THE CARTEL'S SURRENDER, AS MEMBERS AT ODDS WITH ESCOBAR
STARTED TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE GROUP.  ACCORDING TO MEDELLIN
OFFICIALS, THE KIDNAPPINGS OF MONTOYA AND ECHEVARRIA ALSO HAD AN
IMPACT ON THE RATE OF ATTRITION AMONG THE "EXTRADITABLES.

   THE CARTEL'S SURRENDER IS NOT SEEN AS A SURPRISE: THE 4TH ARMY
BRIGADE WAS CONDUCTING AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH OF THE ANTIOQUIA
DEPARTMENT IN AN EFFORT TO BRING THE KINGPINS TO JUSTICE.  MOREOVER,
THE ARMY LAUNCHED A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN AMONG THE LOCALS TO ENCOURAGE
THEM TO INFORM AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF
JOSE GON ALO RODRIGUE GACHA, ESCOBAR AND OCHOA WERE CONSTANTLY ON THE
MOVE.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR STATE SECURITY STATES THAT SOPHISTICATED
COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT IN MEDELLIN ENABLED THEM TO LEARN ABOUT
ESCOBAR'S INTENTIONS ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
ESTABLISH THEIR EXACT WHEREABOUTS, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY NEVER
REMAINED IN ONE PLACE FOR MORE THAN SIX HOURS AT A TIME.  THE TWO DRUG
BARONS ALWAYS TRAVELED WITH AN ESCORT OF SIX TO EIGHT MEN WHOM THEY
TRUSTED IMPLICITLY.

   ACCORDING TO A HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICIAL, "WHEN ESCOBAR BEGAN
LOSING POWER IN MEDELLIN, HIS CLOSEST AIDES, FEARING PERSECUTION, WENT
INTO HIDING."  HE ADDS THAT ESCOBAR AND OCHOA TOOK ON THE CAUSE OF
TRAFFICKERS WANTED BY THE UNITED STATES, BUT NOTES, "WE ARE WELL AWARE
OF THE FACT THAT THE CALI CARTEL MEN DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY."

   THE EL TIEMPO ARTICLE NOTES THAT ON 19 JANUARY SEVERAL LEADING
COLOMBIAN NEWSPAPERS CIRCULATED A NOTICE POINTING TO ESCOBAR AS THE
MAN WHO ACTS IN THE NAME OF THE "EXTRADITABLES."  LATER, IT WAS
CONFIRMED THAT THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE NOTICE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A
DEMENTED PERSON WHOSE NAME HAD CLEARLY BEEN USED.  EL TIEMPO ASKS:.
"COULD THIS BE A MESSAGE FROM OTHER DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO ARE UNWILLING
TO PAY FOR PABLO ESCOBAR'S ACTIONS?  COULD IT BE A MESSAGE FROM THESE
SAME TRAFFICKERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THIS BUSINESS AND
THEREFORE ARE UNWILLING TO HAVE ESCOBAR AND OCHOA SPEAK FOR THEM?"

FORMER COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE CHILEAN NAVY, TODAY HARSHLY ATTACKED
PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA.

   ASKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT ONLY THREE OUT OF 11 PRESIDENTS WHO WILL
BE IN CHILE FOR AYLWIN'S INAUGURATION WILL SALUTE CURRENT PRESIDENT
GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET ON SATURDAY, MERINO SAID: "WE HAVE ALL KINDS
OF THEM. I WILL NOT SHAKE HANDS WITH THAT MAN GARCIA FROM PERU. HE IS
FILTHY [MUGRIENTO]."  THE ADMIRAL CONTINUED: "NEITHER WILL I SHAKE
HANDS WITH A GRIMY PERSON WHO HAS KILLED ANY NUMBER OF PATRIOTS AND
WHO IS CREATING TROUBLE FOR THAT LADY...WHAT IS HER NAME?...CHAMORRO."
MERINO WAS REFERRING TO ORTEGA, WHO WILL ARRIVE IN SANTIAGO ON SUNDAY.

   MERINO, WHO RETIRED AFTER 16 YEARS AS NAVY COMMANDER IN CHIEF, MADE
THESE REMARKS AFTER A GOVERNMENT JUNTA FAREWELL SESSION. THE
GOVERNMENT JUNTA HAS FUNCTIONED AS A LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SINCE 1973.

   MERINO SAID: "SOME PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT TO SHAKE THE PRESIDENT'S
HAND COME FROM WRETCHED COUNTRIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING OF HUNGER,
COUNTRIES EXPERIENCING DESPERATE INFLATION AND ECONOMIC SITUATIONS.
THEY ARE PROPERLY REPRESENTED [SON UNOS PUEBLOS TALES POR CUALES]."

THE RADIO STATION NETWORK CARACOL REPORTED TODAY.  THE RESULTS WERE REPORTED
ONLY A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE ELECTIONS ENDED AT 1600 (2100 GMT) IN A

   SIMULTANEOUSLY, A PRIVATE POLLING CONCERN THAT CONDUCTED A SURVEY

LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATE JUAN MARTIN CAICEDO WAS ELECTED THE NEW MAYOR
OF BOGOTA AND ANOTHER LIBERAL PARTY MEMBER, OMAR FLOREZ VELEZ, WILL

AFTER STAYING IN POWER FOR 16 YEARS, GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET WAS FINALLY
COMPELLED TO LEAVE THE LA MONEDA PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, WHICH HE CAPTURED
DURING THE MILITARY COUP OF SEPTEMBER 11, 1973.

   LAWYER PATRICIO AYLWIN, 71, LEADER OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC
PARTY, BECAME ITS NEW MASTER TODAY.  HE SCORED A SWEEPING VICTORY
DURING DECEMBER'S GENERAL ELECTIONS WITH THE SUPPORT OF ALL THE
OPPOSITION PARTIES, INCLUDING COMMUNISTS.

   THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CHILE WILL BY NO MEANS BE EASY.
BOMB EXPLOSIONS SHOOK THE CAPITAL ON THE EVE OF THE INAUGURATION
CEREMONY AS MILITANTS REMINDED THE PUBLIC OF THEIR PRESENCE.

   ACCORDING TO AYLWIN, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO OVERCOME
THE DEEP POLITICAL DIVISION OF CHILEAN SOCIETY.  "ONLY THIS," AYLWIN
BELIEVES, "WILL ALLOW CHILE TO DO AWAY WITH VESTIGES OF THE
TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM AND EVENTUALLY EXPAND PARLIAMENT'S POWERS, TO
AMEND THE CONSTITUTION AND THE UNFAIR ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND TO LEGALISE
BANNED PARTIES.

   ANALYSTS BELIEVE THE REVIVAL OF CHILE, WHICH HAS LONG-STANDING
DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS, WILL BE HELD BACK BY THE FACT THAT, ACCORDING
TO THE CONSTITUTION IN FORCE, PINOCHET WILL REMAIN COMMANDER-IN- CHIEF
OF THE GROUND FORCES FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS.  THIS SUBSTANTIALLY
CURTAILS THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHTS AS SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE COUNTRY'S
ARMED FORCES.  FURTHERMORE, BEFORE STEPPING DOWN, THE FORMER RULER HAS
ENSURED HIMSELF AN OBEDIENT MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, THE CHILEAN
PARLIAMENT'S UPPER CHAMBER.

   IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME
THE ISOLATION THAT RESULTED FROM THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, WHEN HUMAN
RIGHTS WERE GROSSLY VIOLATED AND THOUSANDS OF FREEDOM FIGHTERS WERE
RUTHLESSLY PERSECUTED OR ELIMINATED.  THIS TASK IS FACILITATED BY THE
FACT THAT RELAXATION PROCESSES ARE GAINING MOMENTUM IN THE WORLD AND
EAST-WEST COOPERATION IS ON THE UPSWING.

   NUMEROUS FOREIGN GUESTS, INCLUDING A SOVIET DELEGATION, ARRIVED FOR
THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY AND THE TRANSFER OF POWER TO A CIVILIAN
GOVERNMENT.  AN AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE SIGNED THESE DAYS ON THE
RESTORATION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND CHILE
AND ON THE OPENING OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMBASSIES IN MOSCOW AND
SANTIAGO.

COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE INVADED THE VERACRUZ
COMMUNITY IN THE ARRAIJAN DISTRICT.  ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE
THIS REPORT, THE CRIMINALS ARE WELL-ARMED AND APPARENTLY, WILLING TO
FIGHT TO THE END TO MAINTAIN THE CRIMINAL RING, LEFT TO THEM BY FORMER
DICTATOR MANUEL ANTONIO NOREIGA.

   "THEY HAVE WEAPONS SIMILAR TO THE ONES USED BY THE MURDERING
DIGNITY BATTALIONS' IN THEIR PRACTICES AND THEY HAVE RECEIVED MANY
LATE NIGHT VISITS; SOME NEIGHBORS SAY THEY ALSO SELL DRUGS," SAID A
VERACRUZ RESIDENT WHO DID NOT WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED FOR FEAR OF
RETALIATION BY THE COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS.

   THE CHARGES PRESENTED BY VERACRUZ RESIDENTS MAY RESULT IN ANOTHER
POLICE OPERATION THAT WILL, ONCE AND FOR ALL, ELIMINATE ALL THE BANDS
OF ARMED ASSAILANTS AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO WERE ARMED IN THE PAST BY
MANUEL ANTONIO NOREIGA DICTATORSHIP.  THE MOST DANGEROUS ASPECT OF
THIS SITUATION IS THE RUMORS IN THE CORREGIMIENTO THAT MANY
COLOMBIANS, WHO ESCAPED FROM THE RECENT POLICE OPERATION IN CURUNDU,
HAVE HIDDEN IN VERACRUZ AND THIS CLEARLY INDICATES THAT THERE IS A
FEARLESS ARMY OF CRIMINALS MADE UP OF PANAMANIANS AND UNDOCUMENTED

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), NO DATE (RADIO KW CONTINENTE) -- [INTERVIEW
WITH ENDARA BY MONTANER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [ENDARA] THERE WAS NOTHING
REMOTELY CLOSE TO A TRIAL HELD, EVEN IF WE HAD THE DEATH PENALTY AS A
PUNISHMENT FOR MILITARY CRIMES.  THEY WERE ASSASSINS OF THE WORST
KIND.  THERE WERE OTHER PREVIOUS INCIDENTS, BUT BASICALLY THIS IS THE
ACCUSATION.

   [MONTANER] OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI'S DEATH?

   [ENDARA] GIROLDI AND MANY OTHERS.  MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED DURING
THOSE DAYS.  WE DO NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

   [MONTANER] YOU DO NOT KNOW?

   [ENDARA] WE DO NOT KNOW.

   [MONTANER] ARE YOU GOING TO LET THEM LEAVE?  ARE YOU GOING TO LET
THEM ESCAPE TO PERU?

   [ENDARA] LOOK, AS A LAWYER I KNOW WHAT LATIN AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL
TREATIES SAY -- THOSE THAT HAVE ONLY BEEN SIGNED AND RATIFIED BY THE
LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT RATIFIED
THEM -- REGARDING THE RIGHT TO ASYLUM.  THE HOST COUNTRY DECIDES WHAT
CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED, NOT THE HOME COUNTRY.  THERE ARE RIGHTS
ESTABLISHED IN THOSE TREATIES.  THE HOME COUNTRY MAY INQUIRE ABOUT THE
CHARGES THAT HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT
REFUGE.  THE HOME COUNTRY MAY ASK THE HOST COUNTRY NOT TO DETERMINE
WHAT CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED IN EACH CASE.  IF THE HOST COUNTRY HAS
ALREADY DECIDED ON THE CHARGES, IT MAY BE ASKED BY THE HOME COUNTRY TO
RECONSIDER ITS DECISION AND TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THOSE
CHARGES.  WE ARE CURRENTLY EXERCISING THOSE RIGHTS.

   WE HOPE PERU DOES NOT INSIST BECAUSE OUR RELATIONS, AS YOU HAVE
ALREADY SEEN [CHANGES THOUGHT] THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING OTHER CASES,
WHICH ARE LESS SERIOUS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE THE CASE OF A MAN LIKE
TOTY SUAREZ [PRESIDENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PANAMENIST PARTY, PRD]; WE
HAVE THE CASE OF GENERAL NORIEGA'S WIFE AND DAUGHTERS; AND A NUMBER OF
OTHER CASES WHERE WE CANNOT CALL THESE PEOPLE ASSASINS.  WE DID NOT
HAVE ANY EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM.

   [MONTANER] WHAT ABOUT MANUEL SOLIS PALMA?

   [ENDARA] SOLIS PALMA LEFT THE EMBASSY AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM.
HIS CASE WAS INTERESTING.  HE SOUGHT ASYLUM AND THE VENEZUELAN EMBASSY
NEVER, NEVER, OFFICIALLY INFORMED THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT THAT SOLIS
PALMA WAS THERE.

   [MONTANER] HE WAS THERE AS A GUEST?

   [ENDARA] YES.  WHEN WE WERE ASKED ABOUT THE FATE OF SOLIS PALMA, WE
REPLIED THAT, FOR ALL WE KNEW, HE WAS SPENDING A FEW DAYS WITH THE
VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR.  HE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO SLEEP THERE.

   [MONTANER] I WILL ASK A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

   [ENDARA] YOU MAY ASK ANYTHING YOU LIKE.

   [MONTANER] THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE INVASION WAS A
U.S. PRETEXT NOT TO RETURN THE CANAL IN THE YEAR 2000.

   [ENDARA] NO, NO.  THERE HAS NEVER EVEN BEEN THE SLIGHTEST HINT FROM
ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, NOT FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OR THE
ARMY ABOUT THIS.  CONGRESSMEN OF ALL IDEOLOGIES HAVE BEEN HERE, EVEN
FROM THE EXTREME RIGHT -- I DO NOT THINK THERE ARE ANY EXTREME LEFTIST
CONGRESSMEN IN THE UNITED STATES -- AS WELL AS SENATORS.  MILITARY
OFFICERS HAVE ALSO BEEN HERE.  I HAVE HAD LONG TALKS WITH THEM.  THEY
HAVE NOT EVEN HINTED THAT THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE TREATIES OR THAT
THEY WANT TO STAY BEYOND THE YEAR 2000.  ALL OF THAT IS NORIEGA'S
NONSENSE.  NORIEGA WAS THE ONE WHO STARTED THAT CAMPAIGN.  THERE HAS
NEVER BEEN ANY TALK ABOUT THIS, NOT EVEN ABOUT THE BASES REMAINING
BEYOND THE YEAR 2000.  THERE HAS BEEN NONE OF THAT AT ALL.  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, 16 MAR 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT]
THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] DEEMS AS POSITIVE THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOGNITION OF THE FMLN'S
GOOD-WILL GESTURES.  HOWEVER, WE VIEW AS A NEGATIVE THAT IN THE
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE THERE IS NOT A CORRESPONDING ATTITUDE. IN THIS
REGARD, WE INFORM:

   1.  THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TRIES TO UNDERMINE OUR GESTURE.  THE
FMLN HAS NEVER HAD A POLICY TO ATTACK OR HARM THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.
OUR GESTURES ARE A CLEAR CONTRIBUTION TO STRENGTHENING THE SPACE OF
OTHER POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO ALLOW FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN
THE POLITICAL NEGOTIATION SOLUTION PROCESS AND IN THE EFFORT TO
HUMANIZE THE CONFLICT.

   2.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES CONTINUE TO VIOLATE HUMAN
RIGHTS, BOMB CIVILIAN POPULATED AREAS, SUBJECT THE COUNTRY TO A
PERMANENT STATE OF SIEGE, BE IT LEGAL OR DE FACTO.  IN A CONSTANT AND
SYSTEMATIC MANNER, THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS A POLICY OF CAPTURING AND
TORTURING LEADERS OF PEOPLE'S GROUPS; MAINTAINS SIEGES AND RAIDS;
HARASSES THE COMMUNITIES OF REPATRIATES; AND SABOTAGES THE PROPERTY OF
RESIDENTS IN AREAS UNDER THE FMLN CONTROL.

   IN THE MEANTIME, NO STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN TO INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH
THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THE MASSACRE OF FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], WHILE THE TRIAL
AGAINST THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS HAS STAGNATED AND THE
SUSPECTS ARE PROMOTED OR SENT ABROAD.

   THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO APPOINT AS DEFENSE MINISTER THE PERSON
WHO GAVE THE ORDER TO MURDER THE PRIESTS, AND IT ALLOWS THE REPORTED
EXECUTIONER TO LIVE IN A LUXURY APARTMENT.

   3.  WE AGREE WITH THE PERMANENT, SERIOUS, IMPORTANT, AND RESERVED
CHARACTER THAT THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS SHOULD HAVE.

   4.  THE GOVERNMENT IS MORALLY AND POLITICALLY COMPELLED TO
IMPLEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE GOODWILL GESTURES THAT WILL PERMIT THE
EXERCISE OF CITIZEN'S FREEDOMS AND CEASE THE DAILY HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS AND ALL FORMS OF AGGRESSION AIMED AT THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.

   5.  WE WARN THAT IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE FOR THE PEOPLE'S PEACE AND
DEMOCRACY HOPES THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES TRY TO HARDEN
WARMONGERING POSITIONS, BELIEVING IN THE MIRAGE OF AN ALLEGED WEAKNESS
OF THE FMLN.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS MISTAKE WOULD ONLY LEAD TO A WORSENING
OF THE WAR AND WOULD FURTHER DELAY THE POSSIBILITIES OF NEGOTIATIONS,
DEMOCRATIZATION, AND PEACE FOR EL SALVADOR.

[SORAYA CAICEDO] [TEXT] PICHINCHA BATTALION TROOPS HAVE SEIZED
LETTERS, WHICH WERE GOING TO BE USED FOR EXTORTION, AND LARGE AMOUNTS
OF WAR MATERIEL IN CLASHES WITH THE 6TH FARC FRONT IN THE BORDER AREA
OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF VALLE DEL CAUCA AND CAUCA.  IN THE OPERATIONS
THAT TOOK PLACE ON 15 MARCH IN THE JAGUAL AREA IN CORINTO
MUNICIPALITY, IN NORTHERN CAUCA, 3RD BRIGADE TROOPS KILLED ALONSO
CORTES, CONSIDERED THE FARC'S MOST IMPORTANT LEADER IN THE
SOUTHWESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.  TWO OTHER GUERRILLAS WERE ALSO
KILLED.

   IN THAT AREA THE PICHINCHA BATTALION TROOPS FOUND A COCAINE
PROCESSING LABORATORY AND 35 PACKAGES OF MARIJUANA.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GENERAL JOSE MANUEL BONNET] WE DEMONSTRATED THAT
THE FARC IS INVOLVED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING.  AS YOU SAW, THE SEIZURE OF
35 PACKAGES OF MARIJUANA AND OF A COCAINE PROCESSING LABORATORY IN
CALOTO, IN THIS SAME OPERATION, SHOWS US THAT WE ARE FACING A
SUBVERSIVE GROUP THAT IS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE MARIJUANA BUSINESS
ACTIVITY.  [END RECORDING]

   ON ALONSO CORTES' BODY, THE TROOPS FOUND A LISTING OF PEOPLE WHO
WERE SUBJECTED TO [1-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] NOTING THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE TO THE FARC.  THEY ALSO FOUND A
LETTER THAT CORTES NEVER SENT FOR A [7-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] FOR
HAVING IMPLICATED THE M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT].  IN THIS MILITARY
OPERATION CALLED "LILIANA," THE ARMY SEIZED SHOTGUNS, PISTOLS, ONE
SUB-MACHINE GUN, AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF AMMUNITION, IN ADDITION TO
DYNAMITE AND CABLES FOR EXPLOSIVES, COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT, DENTAL
EQUIPMENT, AND CLOTHING FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE MILITARY FORCES.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 16 MAR 90 (BARRICADA) -- [SPEECH] [NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT] IN SEPTEMBER 1970, I WAS IN JAIL WITH
OTHER COMRADES.  OUR JAILERS DID NOT ALLOW US TO READ THE NEWSPAPERS
-- NOT EVEN THE ONES PUBLISHED BY THE SOMOZAS -- BUT WE FOUND WAYS TO
GET A RADIO AND WERE ABLE TO LEARN OF SALVADOR ALLENDE'S ELECTION
THROUGH THE PEOPLE'S VOTE.

   WE WERE JAIL IN 1973 WHEN WE LEARNED OF THE BRUTAL COUP AGAINST THE
PEOPLE'S WILL AND DEMOCRACY.  RADIO REPORTS SAID THAT PLANES WERE
BOMBING LA MONEDA [CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE] AND WE PICTURED
PRESIDENT ALLENDE HEROICALLY RESISTING THERE.

   WE DID NOT LOSE OUR MORALE.  WE BECAME INDIGNANT AND FULL OF
COURAGE.  WE THOUGHT AND FELT CERTAIN THAT THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WOULD GO
ON WINNING BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR WILL TO BE FREE AND SOVEREIGN.

   SO MANY YEARS HAD TO PASS FOR US TO BE HERE WITH THE CHILEAN
PEOPLE.  AFTER THAT CAME THE VICTORY OF THE REVOLUTION IN NICARAGUA.
THAT DAY, 19 JULY 1979, WHEN THE VICTORIOUS PEOPLE ENTERED MANAGUA,
SALVADOR ALLENDE WAS THERE STRUGGLING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE NICARAGUAN
PEOPLE.

   I WANT TO OUTLINE SOME VIEWS, BUT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE
CURRENT INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL PICTURE IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX.  FIRST
OF ALL, WE RESPECT POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL OPTIONS.  WHEN WE WON, WE
SANDINISTS THOUGHT THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO DEVELOP A DIFFERENT
SYSTEM TO GIVE NICARAGUA WHAT HAD BEEN DENIED TO IT BY THE IMPERIALIST
DOMINATION.

   SANDINO EPITOMIZED THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE'S ANTI-IMPERIALIST
STRUGGLE, THE FIRST MANIFESTATIONS OF WHICH OCCURRED LAST CENTURY.
SANDINO ADVOCATED NOT ONLY A STRUGGLE AGAINST NORTH AMERICAN
INTERVENTION, BUT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE.  HE DID NOT PUT A LABEL
ON HIS THOUGHTS, BUT WAS CONVINCED THAT TO BE A [TRUE] NICARAGUAN AND
LATIN AMERICAN, ONE HAD TO BE ANTI-IMPERIALIST AND HAD TO ADVOCATE
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATIONS IN FAVOR OF THE PEOPLE.

   THE SANDINIST FRONT [SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] PICKED UP
SANDINO'S BANNERS AND ADOPTED HIS STILL UNFINISHED HISTORICAL PROGRAM.
SO, AFTER VICTORY, WE THOUGHT THAT WE HAD TO THINK OF A DIFFERENT
PROGRAM FOR NICARAGUA.

   WE REJECTED DOGMAS OR SCHEMES WITH REGARD TO THE METHOD OF STRUGGLE
TO ACHIEVE VICTORY OR THE MODEL THAT WOULD BE VIABLE FOR NICARAGUA IN
THE LATIN AMERICAN CONTEXT.  WE BEGAN WITH THREE BASIC TENETS: A
MULTIPARTY SYSTEM, A MIXED ECONOMY, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE.

   EXERCISING THIS RIGHT, WE SAID: THIS IS THE PATH.  AND THE UNITED
STATES SAID: THAT IS NOT THE PATH.  TIGHTLY CLINGING TO ITS
IMPERIALISTIC POLICY, THE UNITED STATES DECIDED TO DESTROY THE
NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION AND ORGANIZED A MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND
ECONOMIC ONSLAUGHT.

   YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS STORY AND ITS TRAGIC TOLL OF 60,000
VICTIMS.

   WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEFEND NICARAGUA AND THE GAINS ATTAINED BY THE
REVOLUTION, BECAUSE THIS DEFENSE WAS HEADED BY THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE
WHO, ARMED WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE AND COURAGE, TOOK UP WEAPONS TO
DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY.  [CONTINUED]

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 16 MAR 90 (BARRICADA) -- [SPEECH] [NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE GOVERNMENT THAT TAKES
OFFICE ON 25 APRIL CAN REST ASSURED, AS CAN MANY LATIN AMERICAN
GOVERNMENTS, THAT THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE ANOTHER MILITARY COUP IN
NICARAGUA.  THE HUMBLE PEOPLE, THE PEASANTS, AND THE WORKERS CAN REST
ASSURED THAT THE ARMY WILL SAFEGUARD THE FATHERLAND'S SOVEREIGNTY, IT
WILL NOT TURN THE CANNONS AGAINST THE WORKERS.

   I NEVER SAID THAT THE FSLN WOULD PERPETUALLY REMAIN IN THE
GOVERNMENT, BUT THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD PERPETUATE THEMSELVES IN POWER.
THAT I DID SAY!

   OTHERS WILL SAY THAT THE SANDINISTS MADE MANY CONCESSIONS, BUT IF
WE HELD ELECTIONS, IT WAS BECAUSE WE WERE CONVINCED THAT WE COULD
LOSE, A NEW MODEL IN LATIN AMERICA THAT NOT ONLY GUARANTEES THE
EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRACY, BUT ITS DEVELOPMENT AND DEEPENING.  IT IS
DEMOCRATIC TO CONSTANTLY QUESTION DEMOCRACY TO REFRESH, STRENGTHEN,
AND DEEPEN DEMOCRACY.

   THE CLEANEST AND MOST OBSERVED ELECTORAL PROCESS IS THE ONE THAT
WAS CARRIED OUT IN NICARAGUA.  WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.  THE REPORTERS
SAID THAT IF WE WON THEY WOULD LEAVE, BUT SINCE WE LOST THEY HAVE
STAYED ON TO SEE IF WE WILL SURRENDER POWER ON 25 APRIL.

   ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT THE FSLN SUFFERED AN UPSET IN THE
ELECTIONS, AS A POLITICAL FORCE THAT HAS BEEN THE VANGUARD OF THE
PROCESS THAT LED THE COUNTRY TO DEMOCRACY, INDEPENDENCE, DIGNITY, AND
SOVEREIGNTY, THE FSLN IS NOW CONSOLIDATING THE RESULTS OF DEMOCRACY.
IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE REVOLUTION HAS BEEN DEFEATED, BECAUSE IT HAS
EMERGED FROM THE ELECTIONS STRONGER.

   I AM PREPARING TO ACT AS THE OPPOSITION ALONGSIDE THE PEOPLE WHEN I
AM NO LONGER PRESIDENT ON 25 APRIL.  I AM A DEPUTY, BUT I PREFER TO BE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS, THE FACTORIES, AND THE COUNTRYSIDE.  I HAVE TOLD
THE NICARAGUANS THAT WE MUST CONSOLIDATE THIS PROCESS, WHICH MEANS THE
CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN NICARAGUA.  WE MUST BE MORE CREATIVE AND
IMAGINATIVE THAN EVER, BECAUSE WE WILL FACE NEW CHALLENGES THAT WILL
BE ENRICHING TO US AS A REVOLUTION.

   TO BE A CLANDESTINE OPPOSITION IS NOT THE SAME AS TO RULE FROM
ABOVE.  WE WILL NOW GOVERN FROM BELOW, AND WE WILL DEFEND POPULAR AND
NATIONAL INTERESTS.  THE RETURN OF SOMOZISM IS NOT SOUGHT.  THE
ELECTORAL VICTORY DOES NOT MEAN A RETURN OF THE COUNTERREVOLUTION,
THAT CONTINUES TO THREATEN NICARAGUA.  IF THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IS NOT
DISARMED, THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO HAVE TO CONFRONT THE
COUNTERREVOLUTION, AND WE WILL FIGHT AS WE NEVER DID BEFORE.

   THE UNITED STATES LIFTED THE EMBARGO AND OFFERED AID TO NICARAGUA.
WE WILL NOT BE LIKE RIGHT-WING EXTREMISTS WHO SABOTAGE ECONOMIC
EFFORTS.  RESOURCES HAVE NOT BEEN OFFERED TO A CERTAIN PARTY, BUT TO
ALL OF THE PEOPLE.  NICARAGUA NOT ONLY DESERVES INTERNATIONAL
COOPERATION, IT SHOULD BE INDEMNIFIED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

   WE HAVE FELT THE SOLIDARITY OF PEOPLE THE WORLD OVER, WE HAVE FELT
THE SOLIDARITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN MURDERED BY
THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IN OUR FATHERLAND.  I HAVE HEARD OF EMOTIONAL
EXAMPLES OF SOLIDARITY, SUCH AS BRYAN WILSON'S, WHO SAT IN FRONT OF A
TRAIN THAT RAN OVER HIM, AND WHO TELLS ME HE FEELS PROUD TO BE ONE OF
THE THOUSANDS OF AMPUTEES FROM THE WAR IN NICARAGUA.

   THE BLOOD OF CHILEANS, AMERICANS, AND EUROPEANS WAS SHED IN
NICARAGUA.  I MUST THANK THIS HEROIC AND EXEMPLARY CHILE FOR THE
MANNER IN WHICH IT HAS DISPLAYED ITS FONDNESS FOR THE NICARAGUAN
PEOPLE THROUGH ME, AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, THE
SOLIDARITY OF PEOPLE WHO DEFEND THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM, SOVEREIGNTY,
DEMOCRACY, AND INDEPENDENCE IS INDISPENSABLE.

   THE FUTURE, IT IS SAID, BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THE PRESENT
AND THE PAST ALSO BELONG TO THEM.  THE REVOLUTION SHOULD BE REFRESHED,
IT SHOULD BE WATERED WITH FRESH RAIN; ONLY THEN WILL THE TREES TURN
GREEN AND THE FLOWERS BLOOM, ONLY THEN WILL THE REVOLUTIONARY
PROCESSES BE UNDERSTOOD.  WE COULD TALK FOR HOURS AND HOURS, BUT THIS
IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK.  IT IS THE TIME TO ACT.

   THIS VISIT TO CHILE WILL BE UNFORGETTABLE FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE
HAPPINESS, OPTIMISM, AND CONFIDENCE REFLECTED IN THE FACES AND IN THE
EYES OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE.

   THIS NIGHT WILL BE UNFORGETTABLE FOR ME.  THEREFORE, I WISH TO PAY
HOMAGE TO THOSE WHO WERE EXAMPLES OF LATIN AMERICAN DIGNITY AND ARE
WITH US ALWAYS IN CHILE, NICARAGUA, AND LATIN AMERICA: SALVADOR
ALLENDE AND PABLO NERUDA.  LONG LIVE NICARAGUA!

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 MAR 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES CHARGED TODAY THAT A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS ATTACKED A CONTINGENT
OF SOLDIERS IN THE TOWN OF VICTORIA, NORTHEASTERN CABANAS DEPARTMENT,
FROM A SETTLEMENT FOR DISPLACED PERSONS.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) HAS STATED THAT THE
REBELS FIRED M-60 MACHINEGUNS AT A PATROL OF SOLDIERS PASSING BY THE
SANTA MARTA SETTLEMENT, WHERE SOME 3,000 DISPLACED PERSONS LIVE.

   THE MILITARY REPORT SAID THAT THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE ON 15 MARCH
AND THE SOLDIERS DID NOT ANSWER THE FIRE.

   HOWEVER, THE CHRISTIAN COMMITTEE FOR DISPLACED SALVADORANS
(CRIPDES) DENIED THAT THERE ARE ANY ARMED PERSONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT,
WHERE THE PERSONS WHO RECENTLY CAME BACK FROM THE HONDURAN CAMP OF
MESA GRANDE ARE LIVING.

   TOMASA RUIZ, SPOKESPERSON FOR CRIPDES, SAID THAT THE CHARGES "ARE A
DIRECT THREAT" TO THE SECURITY OF THE DISPLACED PERSONS IN SANTA
MARTA.  "THIS DOES NOT MEAN," SHE ADDED, "THAT THERE ARE NO
CONFRONTATIONS TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE THE CAMP, BUT THERE ARE NO ARMED
PERSONS INSIDE THE CAMP."

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE HIDING AMONG THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION IN ORDER TO ATTACK THE SOLDIERS.

   ON 11 FEBRUARY, ONE ADULT AND FOUR MINORS WERE KILLED AND 16 OTHERS
WERE WOUNDED WHEN A SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER STRAFED A CAMP OF
DISPLACED PERSONS IN CORRAL DE PIEDRAS, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.  ON
THAT OCCASION THE ARMY SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE
GOVERNMENT TROOPS FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES WHO RETURNED TO THE
COUNTRY LATE LAST YEAR, AFTER HAVING LIVED NEARLY ONE DECADE IN THE
HONDURAN CAMPS.

   IN ADDITION, THE ARMED FORCES SAID THAT THREE SOLDIERS HAD BEEN
WOUNDED DURING FIGHTING WITH THE GUERRILLAS IN THE TOWN OF SAN JOSE
GUAYABAL, IN THE CENTRAL CUSCATLAN DEPARTMENT.

   THESE CHARGES WERE MADE PUBLIC ON 16 MARCH WHEN THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ANNOUNCED A SUSPENSION OF SABOTAGE
ACTIONS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS, AND THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS CENTER, AS WELL AS ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN OFFICIALS.

   THE ARMY ALSO MAINTAINED THAT THE REBELS BLEW UP FIVE ELECTRICITY
POSTS IN SAN VICENTE AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENT IN THE CENTER AND
NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE REBELS ALSO HARASSED SOLDIERS
WHO WERE GUARDING AN ELECTRICITY STATION IN A TOWN OF SANTA ANA
DEPARTMENT AND A MILITARY CHECKPOINT ON THE BRIDGE OVER THE ACELHUATE
RIVER IN AGUILARES, NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR.

   ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY REPORT, THESE HARASSMENT ACTIONS BY THE
REBELS DID NOT CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES.

   SANTIAGO, 13 MAR 90 (BARRICADA) -- [REPORT] [MONICA ZALAQUETT] [TEXT]
U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE TALKED WITH PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA DURING AN
OFFICIAL LUNCH AND TOLD HIM THAT HE FULLY AGREES WITH THE NEED TO DEMOBILIZE
AND DISARM THE CONTRAS BEFORE 25 APRIL TO GUARANTEE A NORMAL TRANSITION OF
POWER TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT.

   DANIEL SAID IN A STATEMENT TO BARRICADA: "VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE
TOLD ME THEY ARE WORKING ON AN IDEA SO THAT THE CONTRAS ARE NOT AROUND
BY 25 APRIL.  HE STATED HIS POLITICAL WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS, AND I
BELIEVE HIS POSITION WAS VERY CONSTRUCTIVE."

   WHEN ASKED WHAT STEPS WILL BE TAKEN TO CARRY THIS OUT, HE REPLIED:
"WE -- AND NOT ONLY THE NICARAGUANS AND CENTRAL AMERICANS, BUT ALSO
THE UNITED STATES -- MUST NOW PUT WORDS INTO DEEDS TO PUT THE
POLITICAL WILL INTO ACTIONS THAT WILL ENABLE US TO DISARM AND
DEMOBILIZE THE CONTRAS BEFORE THAT DATE."

   REFERRING TO CERTAIN ATTEMPTS BY UNO SECTORS TO ESTABLISH A
SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARMED FORCES OF NICARAGUA AND THE
CONTRAS' TERRORIST FORCES, DANIEL POINTED OUT: "NO, NO, NO, NOBODY HAS
PROPOSED THIS.  NONE OF THE PRESIDENTS WITH WHOM I HAVE TALKED THINKS
ALONG THESE LINES."

   ORTEGA INSISTED THAT THE CONVERSATION WITH THE U.S. VICE PRESIDENT
HAD BEEN "FRANK, FRIENDLY, DIRECT, AND VERY RESPECTFUL," AND THAT
QUAYLE "IS CERTAIN THAT THE TRANSFER OF POWER WILL BE CARRIED OUT ON
25 APRIL.  HE ALSO STATED HIS WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE SO THAT
NICARAGUA DOES NOT HAVE TO LIVE IN A FAR MORE CRITICAL SITUATION THAN
THE ONE IT IS CURRENTLY FACING IN EVERY SECTOR."

   DANIEL CONSIDERED THE MEETING, WHICH OCCURRED DURING LUNCH, AS
"VERY POSITIVE, AND I FIND HIM CONSTRUCTIVELY INCLINED TOWARD ALL THE
EFFORTS THAT WE, THE NICARAGUANS, HAVE EXERTED, AND WHICH CULMINATED
WITH THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS."

   THE PRESIDENT ALSO REFERRED TO CONVERSATIONS HELD DURING THE FLIGHT
BETWEEN CARACAS AND SANTIAGO DE CHILE WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF SPAIN,
VENEZUELA, COSTA RICA, AND HONDURAS, CONFIRMING: "WE ALL AGREE THAT
THE CONTRAS SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY DISARMED AND DEMOBILIZED."

   ORTEGA TALKED BRIEFLY WITH QUAYLE YESTERDAY MORNING DURING THE TE
DEUM OFFERED AT THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL FOR THE PRESIDENTS WHO WERE
INVITED TO THE INAUGURATION OF CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN.
WHEN DANIEL ENTERED THE CATHEDRAL, THOSE ATTENDING THE TE DEUM
APPLAUDED HIM WHILE HE GREETED THE HEADS OF STATE WHO WERE THERE.
WHEN QUAYLE ENTERED, HE APPROACHED DANIEL AND GREETED HIM IN A
FRIENDLY MANNER, WHILE THE THRILLED CROWD CONTINUED TO APPLAUD.

   PERSONS WHO OVERHEARD THE BRIEF CONVERSATION REPORTED TO BARRICADA
THAT QUAYLE TOLD DANIEL THAT IF HE WISHED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO BUSH HE
WOULD DELIVER IT, THEREBY AGREEING TO WAIT UNTIL AN APPROPRIATE TIME
TO HOLD THEIR CONVERSATION.  THIS MOMENT OCCURRED SEVERAL HOURS LATER
DURING THE OFFICIAL LUNCH.

   DURING THE MORNING DANIEL ALSO MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL
PARTIES OPPOSED TO THE OUTGOING PINOCHET GOVERNMENT.  HE EXPLAINED TO
THEM THE RESULTS OF THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS "A
TACTICAL DEFEAT BUT A STRATEGIC VICTORY FOR THE FSLN."

   SHORTLY AFTERWARD THE PRESIDENT MET WITH CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY
LEADERS, INCLUDING PARTY PRESIDENT ANDRES ZALDIVAR.  AT THIS MEETING
THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS SAID THAT THE NICARAGUAN ELECTORAL PROCESS WAS
CLEAN AND OPEN, AND THEY PRAISED THE FSLN'S FULFILLMENT OF ITS
DEMOCRATIC OBLIGATIONS.  THEY ALSO PRAISED PRESIDENT ORTEGA'S ATTITUDE
AND THE WIDESPREAD INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION HE HAS OBTAINED.

   IN THE AFTERNOON, PRESIDENT ORTEGA SPOKE BRIEFLY TO NEWSMEN AFTER
VISITING "LA MONEDA" PRESIDENTIAL PALACE TO OFFER HIS OFFICIAL
GREETINGS TO CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN.  "I HAVE TRANSMITTED
THE GREETINGS OF THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE TO THE CHILEAN PEOPLE AND HAVE
MADE REFERENCE TO THE LONG-STANDING FRIENDSHIP THAT UNITES THE TWO
NATIONS," DANIEL TOLD NEWSMEN ON THE PATIO OF THE "LA MONEDA" PALACE,
THE SAME PLACE WHERE PRESIDENT SALVADOR ALLENDE FELL FIGHTING FOR HIS
PEOPLE ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973.

   "IT IS AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE, SHARING THIS HISTORICAL MOMENT
WITH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE. I AM CONVINCED THAT WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING
TOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLES OF THE CONTINENT TO BUILD AN INDEPENDENT,
FREE, LATIN AMERICAN FATHERLAND WITH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND
WITH TRUE PEACE, SOVEREIGNTY, AND DEMOCRACY," ORTEGA TOLD THE
JOURNALISTS, WHO RESPONDED WITH APPLAUSE.

SHOT FORMER GOVERNMENT JUNTA MEMBER GUSTAVO LEIGH GUZMAN AT POINT BLANK
RANGE THIS MORNING. GENERAL LEIGH WAS ATTACKED AT HIS OFFICE AT BARRIO ALTO.
HIS CONDITION IS VERY SERIOUS. HE WAS HIT FIVE TIMES DURING THE ATTACK AT
AROUND 1100 [1500 GMT] THIS MORNING. GEN. GUSTAVO LEIGH IS BEING TREATED AT
THE MILITARY HOSPITAL.

   INTERIOR MINISTER ENRIQUE KRAUSS, LEGISLATORS, CHURCH OFFICIALS AND
OTHER AUTHORITIES VISITED THE HOSPITAL TO CHECK ON LEIGH'S CONDITION.

   PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN SUSPENDED ALL AUDIENCES AS A CONSEQUENCE
OF THE SAVAGE ATTACK. MINISTER SECRETARY OF GOVERNMENT ENRIQUE CORREA
SAID THE ATTACK WAS TREMENDOUSLY REGRETTABLE AND CONDEMNABLE.

   INTERIOR UNDER SECRETARY VELISARIO VELAZCO SAID THE GROUP
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK WILL BE SENTENCED WITH MAXIMUM SEVERITY.
CATHOLIC CHURCH AUTHORITIES, LEGISLATORS FROM ALL PARTY BLOCS,
BUSINESSMEN, ENTREPRENEURS, WORKERS, AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL
CONDEMNED THE ATTACK TERMING IT A SHOCK AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS.

   DOCTOR FRANCISCO ALAMAN SAID FORMER AIR FORCE COMMANDER LEIGH IS
FOR THE TIME BEING OUT OF IMMEDIATE DANGER OF DEATH. THE OTHER GENERAL
WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK, RETIRED GENERAL ENRIQUE RUIZ, WAS HIT BY THREE
BULLETS AND IS BEING TREATED AT THE AIR FORCE HOSPITAL.

   SO FAR THE MILITARY HOSPITAL HAS NOT RELEASED ANY OFFICIAL REPORT
ON LEIGH'S CONDITION. THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT, AUTONOMOUS

HAS SAID THAT FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS HE HAD ASKED THE GOVERNMENT FOR
PROTECTION, THAT HIS LIFE WAS IN DANGER, AND THAT HE HELD THE
GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM.  THAT IS
WHAT JARAMILLO OSSA SAID.

   [LEMOS] DID YOU SAY FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS?

   [REPORTER] THAT IS WHAT JARAMILLO OSSA SAID, THAT THE GOVERNMENT
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SAFETY DURING THE PAST 4 YEARS.  HE ALSO SAID
THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED FROM THEN ON WOULD ALSO BE BLAMED ON YOUR
STATEMENT, AND THAT THE BEST SERVICE YOU COULD GIVE THE COUNTRY WOULD
BE TO RESIGN.

   [LEMOS] I ALREADY REPLIED TO A QUESTION ABOUT MY RESIGNATION.  I
CANNOT RESIGN BECAUSE I AM NOT GUILTY.  BY RESIGNING I WOULD BE
ADMITTING MY GUILT TO SOMETHING I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH.  HOWEVER, I
AM GLAD THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR THE PAST 4
YEARS.  I WAS A JOURNALIST FOUR YEARS AGO.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] MADE A MISTAKE A FEW DAYS AGO BY
AGAIN LINKING THE UP WITH THE FARC?

   [LEMOS] I PREFER NOT TO DISCUSS THIS TOPIC NOW.  I DO NOT THINK
THAT THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO DISCUSS THAT SUBJECT.

   AFTER THIS SITUATION HAS SETTLED, I WILL HAVE TO FILE A FORMAL
STATEMENT AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHERE I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED
BY THE UP.  AS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, I AM OBLIGED TO APPEAR BEFORE
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO EXPLAIN MY ACTIONS, BUT NOW IS NOT
THE MOMENT TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LEMOS] OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT IS VERY DISTRESSED, AS WE ALL ARE.
WE BELIEVE THIS IS A TERRIBLE; THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.  IT IS EVIDENT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING A GOAL
OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS.  THE
GOVERNMENT WANTS A FREE ELECTORAL PROCESS; IT IS COMMITTED TO THAT.

   TODAY, WHEN WE HAVE A COMPLETELY ORDERLY ELECTORAL PROCESS, IT
WOULD BE ABSURD, ILLOGICAL, IRRATIONAL, AND SENSELESS FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE ACTIONS THAT RUN COUNTER TO ITS GOAL OF ENSURING
THAT ITS TERM ENDS IN PEACE AND THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE
NORMALLY.

   [REPORTER] THE UP HAS AGAIN CAST DOUBT OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S
GUARANTEES FOR THE CANDIDATES AND THE PARTY.

   [LEMOS] I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE EVERYTHING HUMANLY
POSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF CANDIDATES, NOT ONLY THE SAFETY OF
UP MEMBERS, BUT OF ALL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR
AFFILIATION.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE, EVIDENCE OF THE FACT THAT
DR JARAMILLO'S BODYGUARDS REACTED AND, I UNDERSTAND, BY KILLING ONE OF
THE ASSASSINS, AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I HAVE HEARD, AND ARRESTED
ANOTHER ONE, WHICH HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, SHOWS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS
INDEED OFFERING PROTECTION.

   THEREFORE, DR. JARAMILLO WAS INDEED ENJOYING GOVERNMENT PROTECTION
JUST AS THE OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE.  WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT
THE ASSASSINS CARRY OUT SURPRISE ATTACKS.  AT A GIVEN MOMENT, AN
APPROACHING PERSON CAN CAN PULL OUT A WEAPON AND KILL WHOMEVER HE
WANTS.  THERE IS NO 100-PERCENT PREVENTION AGAINST THIS.  THIS HOLDS
TRUE NOT ONLY IN COLOMBIA BUT IN MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.  THE
VERY COURSE OF THESE TERRIBLE EVENTS OF THIS MORNING AT THE AIPORT
SHOW THAT DR JARAMILLO WAS INDEED PROTECTED.

   [REPORTER] THE UP HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL FILE SUIT AGAINST
YOU FOR THIS ASSASSINATION.

   [LEMOS] THAT IS FINE.  IF THE UP HAS ANY EVIDENCE THAT I AM
INVOLVED IN DR. JARAMILLO'S ASSASSINATION, THEN IT MUST FILE SUIT,
BECAUSE OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE ACTING AS AN ACCOMPLICE TO THIS
ASSASSINATION.  I BELIEVE THAT SUITS MUST BE FILED BY THOSE WHO
SUSPECT THAT A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, AND MYSELF PARTICULARLY, MAY BE
INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION, TO ENSURE THAT THE INCIDENT IS
INVESTIGATED.  THEREFORE, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOOD NEWS AMID A SEA
OF BAD NEWS THAT WE HAVE HEARD TODAY.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] ONLY RESPONSIBILITY FOR PHYSICAL
SAFETY, BUT THERE IS ALSO POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY.  YOU ARE BEING
ACCUSED OF POLITICAL IRRESPONSIBILITY AND OF NOT RESPONSIBILE FOR
PHYSICAL SAFETY.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 22 MAR 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] OTTO SORTO MILLA, THE
SON-IN-LAW OF GENERAL RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN AIR
FORCE, WAS WOUNDED IN AN ATTACK IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY AND IS IN
"SERIOUS CONDITION," ACCORDING TO MILITARY SPOKESMEN AND DOCTORS.

   THE SOURCES POINTED OUT THAT SORTO MILLA, 25, WAS MACHINEGUNNED
FROM A MOVING VEHICLE WHILE LEAVING HIS HOME, LOCATED IN THE LUXURIOUS
SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOOD IN SOUTHWEST SAN SALVADOR.

   DOCTORS TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT GEN. VILLAMARIONA'S SON-IN-LAW IS "IN
SERIOUS CONDITION" AT A PRIVATE HOSPITAL, WHERE HE WAS ADMITTED AT
1030 (1630 GMT), BUT THEY DID NOT SPECIFY WHERE THE BULLET WOUNDS WERE
OR THE NUMBER OF BULLETS THAT HIT HIM.

   MILITARY SPOKESMEN SAID THAT SORTO MILLA HAD BULLET WOUNDS IN
SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BODY, BUT THEY REFUSED TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS AS
LONG AS THE POLICE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS TO CAPTURE THE
ASSAILANTS.

   GEN. VILLAMARIONA, CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE HARD-LINE MILITARY
CHIEFS OF THE ARMED FORCES, WAS APPOINTED TO HIS PRESENT POST IN
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR REPLACING GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, WHO WAS
APPOINTED MILITARY ATTACHE IN ISRAEL.

   THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE (FAS) PLAYED A KEY ROLE DURING THE LAST
GUERRILLA MILITARY OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER 1989, AND IT WAS ACCUSED BY
OPPOSITION GROUPS, HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
OF INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING POOR NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL TO
DISLODGE REPORTED GUERRILLA REDOUBTS.

   THE ATTACK ON SORTO MILLA TOOK PLACE A WEEK AFTER THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SUSPENDED ITS ATTACKS ON
CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CREATION OF
CONDITIONS FOR THE RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.

   BOGOTA, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH LLOREDA
BY REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] AMID ALL THE CONFUSION AND
ALARM THAT TODAY PREVAILS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WHAT WOULD DR.
LLOREDA DO TO RESTORE PUBLIC TRANQUILITY?  WHAT IS THE IMMEDIATE AND
MOST URGENT THING TO DO?

   [LLOREDA] JUAN, I BELIEVE THAT SECURITY IS NO LONGER AN ACADEMIC
ISSUE; IT HAS BECOME AN ANGUISHED NEED FOR COLOMBIA.  THIS WILL
PROBABLY MEAN THAT WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE MANY SACRIFICES IF WE WANT TO
PUT A STOP TO VIOLENCE WITHIN A FEW YEARS.  IN FACT, WE WILL HAVE TO
SACRIFICE SOME OF THE BROAD AND GENEROUS FREEDOM WE HAVE ALWAYS
ENJOYED IN THIS COUNTRY.  GIVEN THESE DEPLORABLE ACTIONS, THE SECURITY
ISSUE HAS BECOME A PRIORITY, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT LIVE IN A SOCIETY IN
WHICH ITS MEMBERS ARE CONTINUOUSLY THREATENED.  THIS NOT ONLY REFERS
TO DR. JARAMILLO OSSA'S DEATH, BUT ALSO TO OTHER DEATHS THAT SOMETIMES
DO NOT APPEAR WHERE THEY SHOULD, MEANING THE FRONT PAGE OF THE
NEWSPAPERS.

   A WEEK OR TWO AGO THE POLICE SAID THAT WE HAVE HAD AN AVERAGE OF 54
VIOLENT DEATHS PER DAY SO FAR THIS YEAR.  IF THIS CONTINUES, WE WILL
HAVE MORE THAN 12,000 MURDERS IN COLOMBIA BY THE TIME PRESIDENT BARCO
TURNS OVER POWER ON 7 AUGUST.  I BELIEVE, AND I THINK YOU SHARE THE
SAME VIEWPOINT, THAT WE HAVE A WORLD RECORD FOR INSECURITY AND
VIOLENCE.  THEREFORE, WE CANNOT TAKE THE RISK OF ALLOWING THE PROCESS
OF MORAL COLLAPSE AND THE STATE OF INSECURITY THAT PREVAILS IN THE
COUNTRY TO CONTINUE.

   WE MUST STRENGTHEN THE STATE SO THAT IT CAN SUCCESSFULLY COUNTER
VIOLENCE.  THE PLEBISCITE AND THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY I HAVE BEEN
PROPOSING INCLUDES THE NEED FOR THE STATE TO HAVE EFFICIENT
INSTRUMENTS TO COUNTER VIOLENT ACTIONS.  THIS IS NOT, LIKE I SAID IN
THE BEGINNING, AN ACADEMIC ISSUE; AND IT IS NOT A PROPOSAL PRESENTED
BY IDEALISTIC YOUTHS.  IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF A NATION THAT COULD
DISAPPEAR OR LOSE ITS FREEDOMS AND DEMOCRACY, IF WE DO NOT ACT
DECISIVELY AND RESOLUTELY.  THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM BETWEEN POLITICAL
PARTIES.

   YESTERDAY I PRESENTED MY GOVERNMENT PLATFORM AND I ISSUED A
PROPOSAL TO DR. [CESAR] GAVIRIA -- REGARDLESS OF THE 27 MAY ELECTORAL
RESULTS, WE MUST REACH A PATRIOTIC AGREEMENT.  WE CAN NOW DO IT IN
HOMAGE TO BERNARDO JARAMILLO SO THAT THE IDEA OF A PLEBISCITE IS
SPONSORED.  THUS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A THOROUGH INSTITUTIONAL
REORGANIZATION.  WE MUST SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT COLOMBIA, RATHER
THAN ELECTORAL LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS.  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN
OFFER SOLUTIONS TO FUTURE GENERATIONS, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE
ARE NOW LOOKING TO THEIR FUTURE WITH UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR.

   [REPORTER] THANK YOU, DR. LLOREDA, YOU ARE VERY KIND.

MINISTER JULIO LINARES ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD GRANTED
SAFE-CONDUCTS TO FIVE FORMER OFFICIALS OF THE DEPOSED REGIME, HEADED BY
GENERAL MANUAL ANTONIO NORIEGA.  THE FIVE FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE
PRESENTLY AT THE ECUADORAN EMBASSY.

   ACCORDING TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT, FORMER PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER RENE
BULTRON, FORMER LABOR MINISTER CESAR MARTANS, FORMER MORTGAGE BANK
MANAGER JULIO SHAIK, FORMER TOURISM INSTITUTE DIRECTOR BERNARDO
DOMINGUEZ, AND FORMER HYRAULIC RESOURCES AND ELECTRIFICATION INSTITUTE
DIRECTOR OVIGILDO HERRERA, ARE THE FORMER OFFICIALS WHO WILL BE ABLE
TO TRAVEL TO ECUADOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

   LINARES ADDED THAT THE DECISION TO GRANT A SAFE-CONDUCT TO FORMER
DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY PARTY LEGISLATOR LUIS "LUCHO" GOMEZ --
PRESENTLY AT THE CUBAN EMBASSY -- HAS BEEN REVOKED BECAUSE HE FACES
CHARGES OF "KIDNAPPING AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE AGAINST
THE PANAMANIAN CITIZEN HERNAN ARIAS."

   THE PANAMANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ALSO REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF
BREAKING RELATIONS WITH MEXICO OR PERU.  ACCORDING TO HIS EXPLANATION,
THE SITUATION WITH CUBA IS DIFFERENT.  TODAY, PANAMA GAVE CUBAN
AMBASSADOR LAZARO MORA FIVE DAYS TO QUIT THE COUNTRY "BECAUSE OF THE
UNJUSTIFIED ATTACKS BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT."

   FORMER PANAMA NATIONAL BANK MANAGER RAFAEL AROSEMENA HAS TAKEN

SUSPENDED CLASSES IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOLS
TOMORROW, 23 MARCH.

   THE PRESIDENT ATTENDED A SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING AT NATINO PALACE
AND THE MILITARY COMMANDERS TALKED WITH JOURNALISTS WHEN LEAVING THE
PREMISES.  DEFENSE MINISTER OSCAR BOTERO SAID THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL
PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT THE ASSASSINATION UPON INSTRUCTIONS FROM PABLO
ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, WHO MADE A DOWN PAYMENT OF 300,000 PESOS TO ANDRES
ARTURO GUTIERREZ, THE ASSASSIN HIRED TO PERPETRATE THE CRIME.

ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION.

   MOREOVER, DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] DETECTIVE
EDISON SANCHEZ MENDIETA, WHO WAS WOUNDED THIS MORNING AT THE AIRPORT
TERMINAL, WAS RELEASED THIS AFTERNOON.

   REFERRING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE WEAPON WAS SMUGGLED INTO THE
AIRPORT, THE AUTHORITIES SAID THAT THIS ISSUE IS BEING THOROUGHLY
INVESTIGATED BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS -- BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN
ASSEMBLED INSIDE THE PREMISES OR SMUGGLED IN WITH THE COMPLICITY OF A
MAINTENANCE WORKER.

   RIOTS, CLASHES, AND THE BURNING OF TIRES AND FIVE BUSES WAS
REPORTED IN SEVERAL HIGHER EDUCATION CENTERS OF BOGOTA, SUCH AS THE
FREE UNIVERSITY, THE PEDAGOGICAL UNIVERSITY, THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;
AND IN NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS POLICARPA SALAVARRIETA, GARCES NAVAS, AND
SOACHA.  THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN THE WOUNDING OF A POLICEMAN, WHOSE
CONDITION IS STILL CRITICAL.

TO BE TRUE, THE REASON FOR THE ATTACK COULD BE IN RETALIATION FOR THE
GREAT NUMBER OF PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL MEMBERS KILLED TWO MONTHS AGO."

STAGING ATTACKS IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE PEOPLE BOYCOTT THE 8 APRIL
PERUVIAN ELECTIONS.

   A BOMB EXPLODED EARLY THIS MORNING NEAR THE HOUSE OF HEALTH
MINISTER PAUL CARO GAMARRA.  CARO'S WIFE SAID THAT THE HOUSE, WHICH IS
IN THE PORT OF EL CALLAO, LACKS POLICE PROTECTION.

   THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CENTER-RIGHTIST DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FREDEMO),
WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS THE WRITER MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, WAS
BOMBED LAST NIGHT.  THE MRTA CLAIMED THE ATTACK THROUGH LEAFLETS LEFT
AT THE SCENE.

   THE MRTA ALSO PLANTED EXPLOSIVES AND LEFT LEAFLETS BESIDE FIVE
FREDEMO PLACARDS.

   FORTY MEMBERS OF FREDEMO WERE AT THE HEADQUARTERS, WHICH IS ON AN
IMPORTANT LIMA AVENUE, WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED.  NOBODY WAS INJURED.
DAVID CIFUENTES, A DEPUTY CANDIDATE OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR
REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA) TODAY SAID THAT THERE IS A TERRORIST
PLOT TO KILL THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.

   ON 14 MARCH CIFUENTES ESCAPED UNHARMED FROM AN ATTACK ON THE CAR IN
WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING.  HIS BODYGUARD DIED IN THE ATTACK WHICH
OCCURRED 40 KM FROM THE CITY OF CAJAMARCA.

   THE TERRORISTS PLACED BIG STONES AT A CURVE IN THE ROAD WHICH
CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO RUN OFF THE ROAD.  THE ATTACKERS THEN OPENED
FIRE ON THE CAR.

   CIFUENTES FELL OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND BROKE HIS ARM IN TWO PLACES,
AND IS NOW IN HOSPITAL.

   SHINING PATH MEMBERS RECENTLY MURDERED 19 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 10
CHILDREN, IN A SMALL VILLAGE NEAR HUANCAYO CITY, 415 KM SOUTH OF LIMA.
THIS ACT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE MAOISTS ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE
KILLING AND DESTROYING.

   SOME 300 PEOPLE WERE MURDERED BY THE SHINING PATH DURING THE
BOYCOTT OF THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ON 12 NOVEMBER 1989.

   THE ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY THE MRTA LAST NIGHT BELIES THE ALLEGED
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WILL CEASE TO USE VIOLENCE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
WAS PUBLISHED BY A LOCAL NEWSPAPER TWO DAYS AGO.

   UNITED LEFT DEPUTY GUSTAVO ESPINOSA, IN A STATEMENT TO THE DAILY
ONDA, SAID THAT IF THE MRTA IS TRULY SEEKING A POLITICAL WAY TO TURN
IN THEIR WEAPONS "THEY WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE PACIFICATION OF THE
COUNTRY."

   HOWEVER, ESPINOSA SAID THAT ONE CANNOT CONSIDER AN END TO THE
VIOLENCE UNTIL THERE IS MORE PROOF OF THEIR ANNOUNCEMENT.

   DURING THE PAST 10 YEARS, THE SHINING PATH AND THE MRTA HAVE
PERPETRATED MORE THAN 16,000 ATTACKS WHICH HAVE CAUSED DAMAGE
ESTIMATED AT $10,000.  THIS ESTIMATE WAS PREPARED BY THE CONGRESSIONAL
COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF ASSESSING THE EFFECTS AND CAUSES OF POLITICAL

   [IBEDACA] I SHARE THIS CONCERN.  IT IS VERY SIMPLE: WHEN YOU ARE IN
A BUILDING OR A HOUSE AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE,
THIS OF COURSE DIRECTLY AFFECTS YOU BECAUSE OF THE UNREST, BECAUSE
THERE MIGHT BE AN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION WHERE FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MIGHT
HAVE TO TESTIFY.

   IBEDACA THUS BEGINS HIS EXPLANATIONS WITH A SIMPLE,
EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND DOMESTIC ANALOGY.  HE ADMITS THAT VENEZUELA "IS IN
A SITUATION THAT SHOULD REALLY CATCH OUR ATTENTION, BECAUSE VENEZUELA
BORDERS COLOMBIA AND WE KNOW THAT COCA IS PRODUCED MAINLY IN BOLIVIA,
PERU, ECUADOR, AND IS PROCESSED IN COLOMBIA.  COLOMBIA IS AMERICA'S
GREAT COCAINE LABORATORY.  DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE RECENTLY SUFFERED
HARD SETBACKS THROUGH RECENT ACTIONS BY THE COLOMBIAN ARMY AND
NATIONAL POLICE IN WHICH THE HEADS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN
KILLED AND GREAT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND COCAINE AND A NUMBER OF
AIRPLANES HAVE BEEN SEIZED.  TO TRANSPORT WHAT IS LEFT, THEY WILL, OF
COURSE, HAVE TO LOOK FOR A BETTER PLACE AND THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE
SEVERAL VULNERABILITIES."

   [OJEDA] LIKE WHAT?

   [IBEDACA] THE EXTENSIVE BORDER, THE PLAINS NEAR IT WITH CLANDESTINE
LANDING STRIPS; THE PROXIMITY TO EASY-TO-USE PORTS AND AIRPORTS.
THROUGH THE ANTIDRUG TRAFFICKING SERVICES AND TOGETHER WITH THE DISIP
[DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE AND PREVENTION SERVICES] AND THE
METROPOLITAN POLICE, WE HAVE A PLAN AND WE HAVE TAKEN DEFINITE ACTIONS
TO FIGHT IT.  AWARE OF THIS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF
INVESTMENT CONTROLS IN THESE STATES NEAR COLOMBIA.  WE ARE RECEIVING
REPORTS OF PROPERTY REGISTRATIONS, BUT WE NEED TO TAKE MORE EFFECTIVE
MEASURES, BECAUSE WE NEED GREATER CONTROL AND SUPERVISION IN THIS
AREA, ESPECIALLY COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS.

   IN 1986, THREE YEARS AFTER THE DRUG LAW WENT INTO EFFECT, THE GN'S
ANTIDRUG DIVISION MADE A RECORD CONFISCATION OF 29,698 KILOS OF
MARIJUANA (NEARLY 30 TONS), A FIGURE THAT DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY IN
1988, AND INCREASED IN 1989.

   SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED BY GENERAL GERMAN SEPULVEDA SIERRA, THIS
OFFICE HAS BEEN IN CHARGE OF COORDINATING AND PLANNING ACTIONS THAT
THE GN DEVELOPS AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, EVEN THOUGH IT IS LIMITED BY
THE DRUG LAW AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE TRIBUNALS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE
FILES MUST BE TURNED OVER TO THE JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE [PTJ].

   IT IS CURRENTLY CALLED THE DIRECTORATE OF THE SERVICES AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING AND IS DIRECTED BY BRIGADIER GENERAL RAMON GUILLEN DAVILA,
WHO ALSO AGREED TO TALK TO EL NACIONAL.

   [GUILLEN] THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS HAS BEEN A JOB OF THE GN DURING
ALL OF ITS EXISTENCE.  I HAVE BEEN IN IT SINCE I WAS A SUBLIEUTENANT.
NOW IT IS CALLED THE "MODERN CRIME" AND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT WARS
TO FIGHT.

   [OJEDA] PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THAT WAR, THE BIG COLOMBIAN
TRAFFICKERS HAVE PROPOSED TO THEIR COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT FORMULAS TO
ACHIEVE PEACE AND RETIRE FROM THE DRUG BUSINESS.  ARE THESE PROPOSALS
FROM THE DRUG CARTELS SINCERE?  WE ASKED THE GENERAL.

   [GUILLEN] I THINK THAT IT IS ONLY A STRATEGY TO GAIN TIME AND SEEK
THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS.  IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT THEY ARE PRETENDING TO
TURN VENEZUELA INTO AN "OPERATIONAL BASE."  THERE IS DEMOCRACY AND
LIBERTY OF MOVEMENT AND INVESTMENT HERE.  IN JUST SAN ANTONIO DEL
TACHIRA, THERE ARE 76 EXCHANGE HOUSES AND ONLY ONE MEETS THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW.  WHEN WE HAVE PRESSURED THE PERACAL TAX
REGISTRY, WE GOT COMPLAINTS FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE.  THE VENEZUELAN AIR
AND HIGHWAY SYSTEM IS VERY FAVORABLE TO THEM.  NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES
CONNECT WITH EUROPE THROUGH VENEZUELA.  A LOT OF MERCHANDISE GOES
THROUGH IN TRANSIT, AND WHEN THEY SEIZE A SHIPMENT, WHAT THEY SAY IS
THAT THE AIRPLANE "CAME FROM VENEZUELA."  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1195 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   LIMA, 27 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE ATTACKS ON FIVE OFFICES OF THE
DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FREDEMO), WHICH IS HEADED BY MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, ON
THE OFFICE OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE,
APRA, AND AGAINST ONE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE, TWO BANKS, ONE STORE, AND
ONE MOVIE THEATER, SHOW THAT TERRORISM IN PERU CONTINUES TO BE USED IN
AN ATTEMPT TO BOYCOTT THE 8 APRIL ELECTIONS.

   ONE GIRL WAS WOUNDED DURING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCURRED IN LIMA
YESTERDAY, AND FOUR INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED WHILE LOOTING TWO SHOE
STORES AND A MARKET AND URGING PEOPLE TO JOIN THEM.

   THE ATTACKS SERIOUSLY DAMAGED THE OFFICES OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES,
ESPECIALLY THAT OF THE FREDEMO, BUT NO ONE WAS INJURED.

   THE PAGINA LIBRE NEWSPAPER TODAY REPORTED THAT SEVEN ALLEGED
MEMBERS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT (MIR) WERE ARRESTED
IN THE CITY OF TRUJILLO, 570 KM NORTH OF LIMA.  THE MIR IS A FACTION
OF THE PRO-GUEVARA TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA).

   THE MAOIST SHINING PATH TERRORIST ORGANIZATION HAS CALLED FOR "AN
ARMED STRIKE" -- A STRIKE UNDER THREAT OF DEATH -- IN LIMA TOMORROW.
THIS IS THE THIRD ARMED STRIKE TO BE CALLED BY THIS ORGANIZATION SO
FAR THIS MONTH.

   A 48-HOUR ARMED STRIKE WAS CALLED IN AYACUCHO, THE BIRTHPLACE OF
THE SHINING PATH ORGANIZATION AND THE OTHER ONE IN HUANTA.

   PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA YESTERDAY DELIVERED 170 PATROL CARS TO THE
NATIONAL POLICE.  HE URGED THE POLICE TO RESOLUTELY FACE THE
INCREASING WAVE OF TERRORISM AND TO MAKE USE OF ALL AVAILABLE
RESOURCES.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE YESTERDAY COMMISSIONED A SQUAD OF 16
MOTORCYCLES TO PATROL THE CITY AND TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE SITES OF
ATTACKS.

   IT IS EXPECTED THAT SUBVERSIVES WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS
IN A WAVE OF TERROR BEFORE THE ELECTIONS AND THIS IS WHY THE POLICE
AND MILITARY FORCES HAVE BEEN PUT ON ALERT.

   ABOUT 100,000 POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN PUT ON ALERT THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE MURDER LAST WEEK OF FOUR CANDIDATES FOR
DEPUTIES, AN APRA LEADER, AND THE MANAGERS OF SEVERAL BUSINESSES IN
LIMA, AND OTHER CITIES.

   LIMA AND CALLAO HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY, WHICH
MEANS THAT INDIVIDUAL GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED.

   YESTERDAY AYACUCHO WAS LEFT IN DARKNESS AFTER A SHINING PATH
ATTACK.  AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED, SEVERAL WERE WOUNDED, AND
VARIOUS ARRESTS WERE MADE BY THE POLICE.

   YESTERDAY WAS THE MOST VIOLENT DAY IN AYACUCHO SINCE LAST NOVEMBER
WHEN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS WERE HELD.  THE ELECTIONS WERE THEN ANNULLED
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH NUMBER OF NULL AND BLANK VOTES.

   LAST WEEK IN HUANCAYO, 415 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, AN APRA CANDIDATE
FOR DEPUTY WAS MURDERED.  YESTERDAY AN INDIVIDUAL WAS WOUNDED WHEN A
CAR BOMB EXPLODED CAUSING EXTENSIVE MATERIAL DAMAGE.

   YESTERDAY IN CHICLAYO, IN NORTHERN PERU, A BOMB WAS THROWN AT THE
HOUSE OF FREDEMO CANDIDATE FOR DEPUTY MIGUEL ANGEL BARTRA, WHO WAS NOT
IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME.

   IN LA LIBERTAD DEPARTMENT A TERRORIST GROUP TOOK OVER THE
GUADALUPITO TOWN EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING IN AN EFFORT TO FIND THE
LOCAL APRA SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE TOWN'S MAYOR.

   WHEN THE TERRORISTS COULD NOT FIND THEM, THEY BLEW UP THE OFFICES
OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND THE POWER STATION CAUSING AN OUTAGE IN THE
ZONE.

   THE STRIKES AFFECTING 100,000 WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY CONTINUE AND
THE STRIKERS HAVE REJECTED THE "LABOR TRUCE" UNTIL THE ELECTIONS ARE
OVER THAT HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY INTERIOR MINISTER AGUSTIN MANTILLA.

   MANTILLA SAID THAT THE STRIKES "ARE BORDERING ON THE SEDITIOUS AND
THE CRIMINAL."

   IN THE LAST 10 YEARS POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU HAS CAUSED 19,000
DEATHS, OF WHICH 700 HAVE OCCURRED SO FAR THIS YEAR.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 29 MAR 90 (CIRCUITO RPC TELEVISION) -- [TEXT]
THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE THIS MORNING AT PUERTO OBALDIA, NEAR
THE COLOMBIAN BORDER, WHICH LEFT TWO PERSONS DEAD AND ONE MISSING.
ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, ONE OF THE PERSONS KILLED WAS A
MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC FORCES, BUT HE HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED.  THE
OTHER PERSON KILLED WAS A COLOMBIAN.


DEV-MUC3-1197 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   BOGOTA, 29 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE REFORMIST SECTOR OF THE LEFTIST
PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) TODAY RESIGNED FROM THE PARTY'S NATIONAL COORDINATING
BOARD, CREATING AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS IN ITS FIVE YEARS OF POLITICAL LIFE.

   DURING THE SECOND DAY OF ITS PLENUM, TWELVE OF ITS 20 MEMBERS,
INCLUDING UP PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA CUELLAR, RESIGNED FROM THE
NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES ACTIVISTS OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA (PCC).

   ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE UP, THE REFORMIST FACTION
RESIGNED FROM THE COORDINATING BOARD BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT WHAT IS
NEEDED IN COLOMBIA IS A BROAD SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT, SUCH AS THAT
ADVOCATED BY UP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, WHO
WAS ASSASSINATED ON 22 MARCH.

   THE LEFTIST SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE INDICATED TODAY THAT THE
POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN THE 27 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, AT
LEAST WITH A JOINT UP AND PCC CANDIDATE, IS GROWING MORE DISTANT.

   WHILE THE UP'S REFORMIST FACTION REJECTS THE ARMED PATH AS A MEANS
TO ACHIEVE POWER, THE SECTOR KNOWN AS THE RADICALS, IN OTHER WORDS,
THE EIGHT MEMBERS WHO DID NOT RESIGN FROM THE COORDINATING BOARD,
AGREE ON USING DIFFERENT FORMS OF STRUGGLE, INCLUDING GUERRILLA
STRUGGLE.

   THE EIGHT MEMBERS WHO DID NOT RESIGN BELONG TO THE PCC.

   IN ADDITION TO MONTANA, LEADERS ANGELINO GARZON, GUILLERMO
BANGUERO, ALBERTO ROJAS PUYO, JULIO SANTANA, AND LUIS EMIRO VALENCIA
WERE AMONG THOSE WHO RESIGNED.

   AT THE SAME TIME, 12 MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE, ANOTHER
SECTION OF THE PARTY, ALSO RESIGNED.  THEY ARE ALSO FROM THE REFORMIST
FACTION.

   THE FRICTION WITH THE REFORMISTS OR PERESTROYKA SUPPORTERS BEGAN ON
28 MARCH, THE FIRST DAY OF SESSIONS OF THE PLENUM, WHEN ANGELINO
GARZON CHARGED THAT THE PCC HAD INTERCEPTED JARAMILLO OSSA'S LETTERS.

   ANOTHER REASON FOR THE DIVISION WITHIN THE COLOMBIAN LEFT WAS THE
NOT VERY FAVORABLE RESULTS IN THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL
ELECTIONS, WHEN THE UP AND THE PCC LOST SEVERAL SEATS IN THE COLOMBIAN
CONGRESS.

   UP TO 22 MARCH, THE DAY WHEN JARAMILLO WAS ASSASSINATED, HE WAS THE
SINGLE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE UP AND THE PCC, BUT AFTER HIS
DEATH, BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO HOLD A PLENUM TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY
WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS.  


DEV-MUC3-1198 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 27 MAR 90 -- [COMMENTARY] [LEONID LEVCHENKO] [TEXT]
OBVIOUS PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN SOLVING THE REGIONAL CONFLICT IN
CENTRAL AMERICA.  VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WILL
MEDIATE A MEETING IN CARACAS BETWEEN SALVADORAN REBELS AND A
GOVERNMENT DELEGATION.  CONFIDENTIAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALAN
GUERRILLAS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
COMMISSION WILL ALSO BE HELD IN THE NORWEGIAN CAPITAL, OSLO.

   LISTEN WHAT OUR COMMENTATOR LEONID LEVCHEKO HAS TO SAY:

   THESE TWO MEETINGS HAVE ONE POINT IN COMMON: BOTH HAVE BEEN MADE
POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE INITIATIVE AND THE MEDIATION OF THE MOST
DIVERSE CIRCLES, WHICH ARE INTERESTED IN PUTTING OUT THE FIRE IN
CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE CARACAS MEETING COINCIDES WITH THE START TODAY
OF THE OFFICIAL VISIT BY SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   VENEZUELAN CHIEF OF STATE CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, WHO WELCOMED
CRISTIANI, HAS ALREADY HELD TALKS WITH THE SALVADORAN REBELS
DELEGATION.

   THE VENEZUELAN CHIEF OF STATE WILL ACT AS MEDIATOR IN THE DIALOGUE
BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS WHEN THEY SIT AT THE
NEGOTIATING TABLE.  THE OSLO MEETING WAS CONCEIVED AT THE INITIATIVE
OF THE LUTHERAN AND CATHOLIC CHURCHES.  THIS IS A BIG ADVANCE IF ONE
CONSIDERS THAT THE FIRST AND LAST DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE
GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS TOOK PLACE IN OCTOBER 1987 IN
SPAIN.  THEY WERE THEN SUSPENDED AND NEVER RESUMED.

   [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY TO ADVANCE TOWARD
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN ALL THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN CONFLICT.  BEFORE THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED IN 1967
BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, MANY INTERNATIONAL FORCES, WHICH
HINDERED A SOLUTION, WERE INVOLVED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT.

   THE MILITARY CHIEFS OF EL SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA ALSO REJECTED THE
NEGOTIATION PROCESS, ASSUMING THAT THEY COULD DEFEAT THE REBEL
MOVEMENT.  IN FACT, DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR MORE THAN 70,000
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN EL SALVADOR AND IN NEARLY 30 YEARS OF
CONFLICT IN GUATEMALA MORE THAN 100,000 HAVE BEEN KILLED.

   IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE FRATRICIDAL WAR IS ABSURD BOTH IN EL
SALVADOR AND IN GUATEMALA.  IT IS TIME THAT, FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF
NICARAGUA, OTHER COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTE TO RESTORE PEACE IN THE AREA.
THIS IS WHY THE REPORTS COMING FROM CARACAS AND OSLO HAVE BEEN GREETED
WITH GREAT INTEREST.  IT IS CLEAR THAT A JUST SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE IN
CENTRAL AMERICA IF ONLY THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE
STRICTLY FOLLOWED AND THE COUNTRIES' SOVEREIGNTY IS RESPECTED BY NOT
MEDDLING IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER STATES.

   THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF THE SOVIET VIEW ON CENTRAL AMERICA.

   NO CITY, NO DATE (FBIS) -- [TEXT] BOGOTA DOMESTIC SERVICE IN SPANISH AT
0230 GMT BEGINS TO BROADCAST LIVE OR RECORDED A SPEECH BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO VARGAS FROM THE NARINO PALACE IN BOGOTA.  RECEPTION IS FAIR TO POOR.

   BARCO BEGINS HIS ADDRESS BY EXPRESSING HIS CONCERN OVER THE
DISNFORMATION CAMPAIGN SURROUNDING THE RECENT EVENTS THAT HAVE TAKEN
PLACE.  HE GOES ON TO CITE THE VARIOUS ITEMS BEING PUBLISHED BY THE
COUNTRY'S MEDIA CONCERNING SECRET DEALINGS WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS, A
RELAXATION OF ACTIONS AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND OTHER STORIES
WHICH HE INSISTS ARE NOT TRUE.

   HE BLAMES NARCOTERRORISM FOR THE VIOLENCE AND CONFUSION WARNS THAT
SOME PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO BLAME THE GOVERNMENT.  BARCO NOTES THAT
THE GOVERNMENT RESPECTS THE MEDIA AND SUGGESTS THAT PUBLIC OPINION IS
BEING MANIPULATED.  HE THEN TOUCHES ON THE CONTROVERSY REGARDING THE
KIDNAPPING OF THE SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY.
BARCO SAYS: "THE GOVERNMENT, IN THE CASE OF THE KIDNAPPING OF DR.
MONTOYA'S SON, AS ON OTHER UNFORTUNATE OCCASIONS, INCLUDING THE CASES
OF DR. ANDRES PASTRANA AND DR. ALVARO GOMEZ, AND EVEN CASES IN WHICH
MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN KDNAPPED BY SUBVERSIVES, HAS
CONSIDERED AS APPROPRIATE AND VALUABLE THE EFFORTS MADE BY THOSE WHO
PERFORMED HUMANITARIAN DUTIES AND SHOWED GOOD WILL FOR THEIR RELEASE."
HE ADDS THAT NEITHER THE SECURITY COUNCIL NOR THE PRESIDENT CAN BE
PREVENTED FROM ASCERTAINING INFORMATION WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE
RELEASE OF HOSTAGES.

   BARCO SAYS THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST NARCOTERRORISM HAS NOT BEEN
EASY. HE ADDS THAT KEEPING THE HOPES OF THE NATION ALIVE, RATHER THAN
ENHANCING THE COUNTRY'S IMAGE, IS THE GOAL.  HE ADDS THAT THE COUNTRY
WILL NOT SURVIVE WITH ITS PROBLEMS, NOTING HIS UPCOMING EUROPEAN TRIP
TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE DANGERS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO REAFFIRM
THE COUNTRY'S GOOD NAME.

   IN ENDING HIS ADDRESS, BARCO URGES CALM AND WARNS AGAINST DIVISION,
ADDING THAT THIS IS THE GOAL OF THE ENEMIES OF THE FATHERLAND.  HE
URGES EVERYONE TO DEFEND THEIR DEMOCRACY.

   BARCO ENDS HIS ADDRESS AT 0250 GMT.

   FURTHER AS WARRANTED.


DEV-MUC3-1200 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   BOGOTA, 31 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [THE
"EXTRADITABLES"] [TEXT] 1. ON 28 MARCH 1990, THE ARMY AND THE NATIONAL
POLICE ELITE CORPS CARRIED OUT MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE HIGHER PARTS
OF ENVIGADO MUNICIPALITY.

   2.  IN SAID OPERATIONS, THE ELITE CORPS ARRESTED COLOMBIAN CITIZENS
FREDDY LOPEZ OSPINA AND JOSE CRISTANTO RETAVISTA ARZON, WHO REMAIN
MISSING.

   3.  IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS IN MEDELLIN, IT HAS BEEN THE CUSTOM OF
THE ELITE CORPS TO ARREST PEOPLE AND TAKE THEM TO THE CARLOS HOLGUIN
POLICE ACADEMY, WHERE THEY ARE TORTURED AND EXECUTED BY MEMBERS OF THE
BOGOTA DIJIN [DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS], WHO
ARE IN THE CAPITAL OF ANTIOQUIA.

   4.  WE HAVE DENOUNCED THESE EVENTS PUBLICLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS,
BUT PRESIDENT BARCO HAS RESPONDED IN STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS THAT
THOSE MEMBERS OF THE ELITE CORPS ARE DEFENDERS OF DEMOCRACY.

   5.  THE COMMANDER OF THE ELITE CORPS IN ANTIOQUIA, AND COLONEL
PELAEZ, CHIEF OF THE BOGOTA DIJIN, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF
ALL OUR COMRADES AND FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE TWO AFOREMENTIONED
CITIZENS.

   6.  IN PREVIOUS COMMUNIQUES, WE PUBLICLY REQUESTED THE CREATION OF
SEPARATE PRISONS AND THE PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF A BRANCH OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN SUCH PRISONS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT, AN
ACCOMPLICE, HAS BEEN SILENT WITH REGARD TO OUR PROPOSALS.

   7.  IF THE CITIZENS WHO WERE ARRESTED IN ENVIGADO ARE NOT PRESENTED
TO THEIR RESPECTIVE FAMILIES, IN REPRISAL WE WILL PLACE A BOMB
CONTAINING 5,000 KG OF DYNAMITE IN ONE OF THE MAIN RESIDENTIAL
NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE BOGOTA OLIGARCHY.

   8.  FOR EACH COLOMBIAN WHO IS TURNED OVER TO THE UNITED STATES, WE
WILL PLACE A 5,000-KG BOMB IN THE CAPITAL OF THE REPUBLIC.

   9.  WE WILL EXECUTE PROGOVERNMENT JUDGES, TRAITOROUS POLITICIANS,
TORTURERS, AND THE MAIN MEMBERS OF THE (CANO) FAMILY.

   THE EXTRADITABLES, 30 MARCH 1990
