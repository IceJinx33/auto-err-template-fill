DISCUSSED."

   HE ADDED THAT THE SANDINIST MOVEMENT PARTICIPATED IN THE COSTA
RICAN MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS BECAUSE IT FEELS THAT
"PEACE IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE REGION AND ESPECIALLY FOR
NICARAGUA."

RAISES PEACE "AS A BANNER" IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN CURRENTLY UNDER

THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING IN COSTA RICA, AS IT WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE
RESULTS OF THE ESQUIPULAS AND TELA MEETINGS."

COUNTERREVOLUTION ALIVE TO APPLY PRESSURE TO THE NICARAGUAN ELECTORAL
PROCESS."

   HE CONTINUED: "ALTHOUGH THE CONTRAS' HAVE BEEN STRATEGICALLY
DEFEATED, THEY STILL CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR INCURSIONS AND
TERRORIST ATTACKS."

HE SAID, ADDING THAT "NICARAGUAN PARTICIPATIVE DEMOCRACY HAS ALSO
ADOPTED MANY ELEMENTS OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED TRADITIONAL DEMOCRACY."

   HE SAID THAT THE DEMOLITION OF THE BERLIN WALL "IS GOOD," BUT HE
ADDED: "IN THE WORLD TODAY THERE ARE MANY WALLS TO BE TORN DOWN,
INCLUDING THE WALL THAT DIVIDES THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND THE WALL
BETWEEN THE RICH AND POOR COUNTRIES."

GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DEATH SQUADS, BANDS OF
PAID ASSASSINS, AND SELF-DEFENSE OR PRIVATE VIGILANTE GROUPS THAT ARE
SOMETIMES CALLED PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  THE ANTI-TERRORIST FORCE
MEMBERS WERE TRAINED AT THE POLICE NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS ACADEMY
LOCATED IN A MOUNTAINOUS REGION IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGOTA FOR 3
MONTHS. LATER ON, THESE MEN WERE SENT TO DIFFERENT AREAS WITHIN THE
COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY IN ANTIOQUIA.

   THE ELITE FORCES STARTED TO WORK ON 2 MAY, AND RESULTS APPEARED VERY SOON
AFTER THAT.  THE CEA UNDERTOOK AN OPERATION NAMED RAINBOW [ARCOIRIS] AND
DISMANTLED 10 COCAINE PROCESSING LABORATORIES IN THE MID-MAGADALENA REGION

META, DESTROYED CLANDESTINE AIRPORTS, AND ABORTED A TERRORIST PLAN IN
CARTAGENA THAT INCLUDED DYNAMITING ITS NAVAL BASE, MAIN INDUSTRIES, AND CAIS

RODRIGUEZ GACHA ESTABLISHED SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS.  THE OPERATIVES HAD THE
OBJECTIVE OF CAPTURING RODRIGUEZ GACHA BUT HE MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  THE SPECIAL
FORCES ALSO CONDUCTED AN OPERATION AT COCORNAC IN AN ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE
PABLO ESCOBAR BUT HE ALSO MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  THE BLOW DELIVERED BY THE

   BOGOTA, 8 DEC 89 (EL SIGLO) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY [PCC]
CENTRAL COMMITTEE HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE RECENT ATTACK
AGAINST THE INSTALLATIONS OF THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY]
AND EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH DAS GENERAL DIRECTOR GENERAL ALFREDO MAZA
MARQUEZ.

   THE PCC LEADERSHIP NOTES THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IT HAS ENDORSED
GEN MAZA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE "CANDID, COURAGEOUS, AND SHED LIGHT
ON THE NEFARIOUS ROLE CERTAIN GROUPS IN THE ARMY AND POLICE LEADERSHIP
HAVE PLAYED IN HELPING ORGANIZE BANDS OF HIRED KILLERS AND THEIR
UNPATRIOTIC EFFORTS AS GO-BETWEENS IN HIRING MERCENARIES WHO TRAIN THE
FASCIST BANDS AND MURDER COLOMBIANS."

   THE PCC CENTRAL COMMITTEE ADDS THAT:

   "THE MEASURES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED BY
PRESIDENT BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION WILL BE INEFFECTIVE UNLESS THE ARMY'
UPPER ECHELON IS REORGANIZED IMMEDIATELY AND PURGED OF ITS CORRUPT
ELEMENTS.  ONLY IN THIS WAY WILL THE "ELITE FORCE" BE PREVENTED FROM
CONTINUING TO CARRY OUT GANGSTER-STYLE ASSAULTS AND BE MADE TO GEAR
ITS ACTIONS TOWARD THE GROUPS WHICH ARE REALLY DESTABILIZING THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES THROUGH CRIME AND BRIBERY; THAT IS, THE
PARAMILITARY GROUPS THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION,
META, CAQUETA, CORDOBA, THE URABA AREA IN ANTIOQUIA, AND IN OTHER
PLACES, AS GEN MAZA HAS REPORTED WITH SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE."  


DEV-MUC3-1009 (TRW)

   CLANDESTINE, 18 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)]
[TEXT] THIS IS A COMMUNIQUE FROM THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN TO
ALL SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND TO OUR HEROIC LEADERS AND FIGHTERS:

   ON 11 NOVEMBER, ALL OF OUR FORCES BEGAN THE MAJOR NATIONAL
OFFENSIVE THAT GAVE A STRATEGIC TURN TO THE WAR.  OUR FIGHTERS HAVE
CARRIED OUT COUNTLESS HEROIC AND DARING ACTS SINCE THEM.  NEITHER THE
CONCENTRATION OF THE ELITE BATTALIONS IN SAN SALVADOR NOR THE MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS OF U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE OR FULL RANGE OF U.S.
TECHNOLOGY AND EXPERIENCE COULD PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ENTERING AND
OCCUPYING EXTENSIVE URBAN AREAS AND ORGANIZING STRATEGIC HARASSMENT OF
THE CITY.

   OUR HEROIC FIGHTERS ASSAULTED THE COUNTRY'S FIVE MAJOR VITAL
CENTERS -- SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, SANTA ANA, USULUTAN, AND
ZACATECOLUCA.  BEGINNING ON THE 11TH, THE WAR THEATRE IRREVERSIBLY
MOVED FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE TO THE MAIN CITIES.  TO POSTPONE IMMINENT
COLLAPSE AND TO STOP A PEOPLE'S UPRISING, THE FATALLY WOUNDED MILITARY
LEADERSHIP AND THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT ORDERED THAT THE LOW-INCOME
NEIGHBORHOODS BE BOMBARDED.  THEY DID NOT CARE HOW MANY CIVILIAN LIVES
IT WOULD COST.  WITH ALL OF ITS ELITE AND REGULAR BATTALIONS, THE
ENEMY ARMY WAS REDUCED TO THE DEFENSIVE AND TO GUARDING THE CITIES.
EXTENSIVE AREAS AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ARE LIBERATED
TERRITORY.

   THE WAR IS NOW WHERE IT CAN BE DEFINED -- IN THE VITAL CENTERS.  THERE IS
NO WAY THE OLIGARCHS' EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC PROGRAM CAN TAKE OFF AND THE
FASCIST GOVERNMENT OF ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], WITH ITS
GENOCIDAL BRUTALITY UNMASKED, IS INTERNATIONALLY ISOLATED AND HATED BY THE
PEOPLE FOR ITS CRIMES.

   THIS GREAT EFFORT OF AUDACITY AND HEROISM THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER
HAS PLACED THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IN
THEIR MOST CRITICAL POSITION OF THE 9 YEARS OF WAR.  THUS FAR, DURING
THIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT -- WHICH HAS GIVEN TO EL SALVADOR AND THE
WORLD REAL HOPE FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE FOR OUR COUNTRY -- 401 OF THE
MOST GENEROUS AND BRAVE SONS OF OUR HOMELAND HAVE FALLEN IN COMBAT.
THIS LIST IS HEADED BY OUR DEAR AND UNFORGETTABLE COMRADE COMMANDER
DIMAS RODRIGUEZ, TO WHOM WE OWE DECISIVE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE CONDUCT
OF OUR STRUGGLE TOWARD VICTORY.

   THE FOLLOWING MILITARY COMMANDERS WHO FELL IN COMBAT ALSO MADE A
CONTRIBUTION: JORGE ORLANDO SANDOVAL CERVELLON, COMMANDER OSCAR;
JEHOVA VASQUEZ, COMMANDER CIRILO; OVIDIO LOPEZ, COMMANDER ORLANDO
MORALES; COMMANDER MISAEL GALLARDO; COMMANDER NICOLAS ALBERTO SARAVIA,
WILBERT; COMMANDER RICARDO MIRANDA, ESTEBAN RUIZ; AND THE COMMANDER
ODIR POLITICAL DIRECTORS [RESPONSABLES] -- JOSE SANTOS YANEZ, PEPE;
AND MILAGRO ALVARADO, JUDY.

   WE RELEASE THE NAMES OF THESE HEROES IN ORDER FOR THE PEOPLE TO
REGISTER THEM ETERNALLY IN THE HIGHEST PLACE IN OUR HISTORY.  THEIR
DEVOTION MULTIPLIES AND STRENGTHENS THE PEOPLE'S POWER.  HUNDREDS OF
NEW FIGHTERS ALREADY HAVE THE WEAPONS AND ENTHUSIASM OF THOSE WHO HAVE
FALLEN.  THEY ARE AT THE FRONTLINE OF THIS POWER OF THE FUTURE WHICH
IS BUILDING, BEFORE THE WORLD'S ADMIRING EYES, DEMOCRATIC AND JUST EL
SALVADOR.

   ALONGSIDE OUR HEROES, THOUSANDS OF OTHER SALVADORANS HAVE
FERTILIZED THE PATH TO PEACE WITH THEIR BLOOD, VICTIMS OF THE FATALLY
WOUNDED BEAST -- THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION
FEDERATION) UNION MEMBERS, THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ANONYMOUS
PEOPLE MASSACRED IN THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS.

   THE REALIZATION OF A GENUINE AND DEFINITIVE CHANGE IS ENSURED BY
THE GREAT POWER OF OUR REVOLUTIONARY ARMY, OF ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, AND
OF WORLD SOLIDARITY.  THOSE WHO FELL TAUGHT TO US THE COURAGE AND
DETERMINATION TO FINISH THIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT, TO CONQUER WHAT WE
THINK THE PEOPLE JUSTLY DESERVE -- DEMOCRACY, PROGRESS, AND PEACE.

   ETERNAL GLORY TO THE HEROES AND MARTYRS, BUILDERS OF DEMOCRACY AND
PEACE.  THE OFFENSIVE CONTINUES, VICTORY IS NEAR.

   [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND; COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN,
JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, EDUARDO SANCHO, FRANCISCO JOVEL, AND SHAFIK JORGE
HANDAL.

DEV-MUC3-1010 (TRW)

   CLANDESTINE, 12 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH LEO
CABRAL, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COMMANDER, BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] THE FIRST QUESTION WE ASK
COMRADE LEO CABRAL IS: WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THE OFFENSIVE AFTER 1
MONTH?

   [CABRAL] TODAY, 11 DECEMBER, AFTER 1 MONTH OF A GLORIOUS AND
VICTORIOUS OFFENSIVE, WE HAVE SOME THOUGHTS REGARDING THIS LATEST
FIGHT.  WE WANT TO STRESS THAT ALL OUR OFFENSIVES HAVE CENTERED AROUND
THE MAIN CITIES IN OUR COUNTRY.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND
SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS STRUGGLE BY THE PEOPLE AND THE FMLN
IS HAVING MAINTAINED THE BESIEGEMENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL
AND ECONOMIC POINTS, MOST ESPECIALLY ON THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL.  THERE
HAS BEEN GREAT PRESSURE IN THE CASE OF SAN SALVADOR, AND THE FMLN HAS
FORCED THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, COLONEL PONCE, AND THE FASCIST HIGH
COMMAND TO CHANGE THEIR STRATEGIC TACTICS THREE TIMES.

   YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF FIRST TRIED TO
DISLODGE THE FMLN FORCES THAT HAD ENTERED SINCE THE EVENING OF 11
NOVEMBER.  WHEN THE FIRST PUPPET ARMY STRATEGIC DEFENSE TACTIC FAILED,
THEY THEN TRIED TO ISOLATE THE FMLN FORCES FROM ONE ANOTHER AND
ANNIHILATE THEM ONE BY ONE.  FOR THIS, THEY CONCENTRATED SPECIAL
FORCES, ESPECIALLY USING ELITE BATTALIONS, IN A SIEGE MODALITY FOR
ANNIHILATION.  THIS ALSO FAILED.  FACED WITH THE SECOND FAILURE OF
THEIR SPECIAL TACTICS TO END THE OFFENSIVE IN A FEW DAYS, AS CRISTIANI
AND THE HIGH MILITARY COMMAND HAD SAID, THEY MOVED A GREAT NUMBER OF
OPERATIONAL FORCES FROM THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR, SUCH AS THE ELITE
BATTALIONS, TO SET UP AN EXTENSIVE SIEGE TO DEFEND THE CAPITAL CITY
AND PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ENTERING IT.  AS ALL OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO SEE -- AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE TO
VERIFY THIS THROUGH A GREAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FLOWING THROUGH
INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS -- THAT SIEGE TO KEEP OUT THE FMLN HAS ALSO
FAILED.  THIS MEANS MORE VICTORIES AND SUCCESSES, SUCH AS INCURSIONS
INTO THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SOUTHERN AREA OF ANTIGUO
CUSCATLAN, AND TWO IMPORTANT ATTACKS ON THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.

   RIGHT NOW WE SEE THAT THE PUPPET ARMY'S SPECIAL CITY OPERATION IS
THEIR THIRD AND LAST PLAN.  THEY HAVE FORMED FOUR COMMANDS TO CONTROL
THE CITY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE DEFEATED BY OUR FMLN MILITARY FORCES.  WE
ALSO MUST ADD TO THIS LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS THAT THE GREAT
CONCENTRATION OF ENEMY ARMY OPERATIONAL FORCES IN THE CAPITAL HAS
CAUSED A GREAT NATIONAL IMBALANCE IN FORCES.  THIS MEANS THAT
EXTENSIVE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY ARE WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF THE
PUPPET TROOPS.  WE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND HAVE WORKED ON
ORGANIZING THE PEOPLE AND RAISING A PEOPLE'S POWER, AN ALTERNATIVE TO
LOCAL REACTIONARY POWER.

   WE ALSO RECORD AS A SUCCESSFUL OFFENSIVE DURING THIS FIRST MONTH
THE FACT THAT OUR ENEMY'S INTELLIGENCE WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETELY
SMASHED.  THE SEARCHES, WHICH HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED IN AN IMPROVISED
MANNER TO MILITARY TROOPS CONCENTRATED IN THE CITIES, ESPECIALLY THE
REPRESSIVE CORPS, HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE ALL THE INTELLIGENCE DATA
BANKS TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND DESTROY THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE.  WE MUST
ALSO RECORD AS ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF OUR GENERAL OFFENSIVE DURING
THIS FIRST MONTH THE FACT THAT THE PUPPET ARMY WAS FORCED TO ABORT
ANOTHER PLAN.  EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SOME BLOODY EVENTS, SUCH AS THE
MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, ALONG WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF KIDNAPPINGS
AND MISSING PEOPLE AND ARRESTS OF MEMBERS OR LEADERS OF GRASSROOT
PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS, WE FEEL THAT THE ARMY AND REPRESSIVE CORPS ARE
INCAPABLE OF ATTENDING TO THE FMLN OFFENSIVE AND THE BESIEGEMENT AT
THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THEIR ANNIHILATION OF
THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.  SO THIS IS ANOTHER SUCCESS.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1011 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] MANY POLITICAL,
UNION, UNIVERSITY, RELIGIOUS, AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN
"BEHEADED" BY THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS A
MONTH AGO, BY THE ARMY'S RESPONSE TO THE OFFENSIVE, AND BY EXTREMIST
GROUPS' RETALIATORY ACTIONS.

   THESE ORGANIZATIONS -- MOST OF WHICH ACTIVELY FAVORED A POLITICAL
SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN WAR -- HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT MAIN LEADERS
BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO PARTY MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS, THEY HAVE BEEN
KILLED, FORCED TO HIDE OR LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOR "SECURITY REASONS"

   THE JESUIT CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY'S (UCA) MAIN LEADERS WERE
MURDERED.  ACCORDING TO RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION SOURCES, APPROXIMATELY
50 PRIESTS -- SALVADORAN AND FOREIGNERS -- HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY
BECAUSE THEY FELT "PERSECUTED" BY THE ARMY WHICH LINKS THEM TO THE
GUERRILLAS.

   THE EDITORIAL OF THE 15 DECEMBER EDITION OF "PROCESO" -- A UCA
WEEKLY PUBLICATION -- ASSERTS THAT THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS ON
UCA PREMISES ON 16 NOVEMBER, OCCURRED AT THE SAME TIME WHEN SEVERAL
CHURCHES AND UNION HEADQUARTERS WERE BEING SEARCHED BY "PEOPLE IN
UNIFORMS."

   "PROCESO" MANTAINS THAT "APPARENTLY, THEY WANTED TO STRIKE ONE SINGLE
BLOW AND BEHEAD EVERY ORGANIZATION LABELED BY GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA AS AN
FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FACADE."

   HOWEVER, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID BEFORE HE LEFT
TO ATTEND A CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA, THAT
HIS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PERSECUTE RELIGIOUS LEADERS.

   THREE DAYS AFTER THE GUERRILLAS STARTED THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE IN
THE DECADE -- ON 14 NOVEMBER -- GUILLERMO UNGO AND HECTOR OQUELI, THE
MAIN LEFTIST OPPOSITION LEADERS, LEFT EL SALVADOR, SAYING THAT THEY
HAD RECEIVED DEATH THREATS IN MESSAGES BROADCAST OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S
RADIO NETWORK.

   LEADERS OF THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF WORKERS (CGT) -- WHICH IS
LINKED TO THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY -- HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY
ARE BEING PERSECUTED AND BLAME THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS FOR
"VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS."

   CGT LEADER JOSE LUIS GRANDE PREZA ASSERTED THAT "TO RECUPERATE AND
MANTAIN THEIR PRIVILEGES, THE EXTREME RIGHTISTS HAVE UNSCRUPULOUSLY
TURNED THE ARMY AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE AND GENERATED REPRESSION AND
PERSECUTION AGAINST THE CHURCH, THE OPPOSITION, AND UNION MOVEMENTS."

   BEFORE LEAVING FOR GUATEMALA TO OBTAIN SUPPORT FOR A CEASE-FIRE IN
EL SALVADOR, GRANDE PREZA SAID THE GUERRILLAS "VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS IN
THE NAME OF REVOLUTION" AND THAT "EACH SIDE JUSTIFIES ITS VIOLENCE,
BUT THE ONLY TRUTH IS THAT THE PEOPLE ALWAYS END UP BURYING THE DEAD."

   LUDOVICO SAMAYOA, DEPUTY OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC], ASSERTED THAT TWO PDC MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS IN
ILOBASCO HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY ARMY MEMBERS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS.
ILOBASCO IS LOCATED 60 KM NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   "THE GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED A GENERALIZED REPRESSION TO DISMANTLE
THE PARTY AND FRIGHTEN OUR MEMBERS WITH THESE ARRESTS," SAID SAMAYOA.

   HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COORDINATOR MIGUEL MONTENEGRO SAID THAT HIS
OFFICE, AS WELL AS OTHER OFFICES OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT OPPOSE THE
GOVERNMENT, "WERE SEARCHED AND DESTROYED BY BOMBS" IN THE EASTERN CITY
OF SAN MIGUEL.

   IGNACIO ELLACURIA, ONE OF THE SIX JESUITS MURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER,
FOUNDER OF "PROCESO" AND UCA DIRECTOR, HAD NOTED A FEW MONTHS BEFORE
HIS DEATH THAT "THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS HAD ENTERED A NEW
PHASE OF MODERATION AND FLEXIBILITY WITH THE INCREASE OF POLITICAL
SPACES."

   IN CONTRAST THE EDITORIAL THAT APPEARS IN THE NEXT EDITION OF
"PROCESO" STRESSES: "IT IS THE HOUR OF THE LONG KNIVES.  THE MALESTROM
OF BLOOD THAT HAS COME UPON THE COUNTRY IN THE PAST MONTH HAS SHRED TO
PIECES THE PHASE OF MODERATION IN WHICH THE MAIN PARTICIPANTS OF THE
SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS HAD BEEN INVOLVED."

POSSIBILITY AND SAID THAT THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY,
PARTICULARLY SINCE THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
OFFENSIVE, REQUIRES, MORE THAN EVER, THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE MILITARILY
STABLE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] I THINK THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY
DEMANDS MILITARY STABILITY.  CHANGES COULD PROVOKE SOME UNREST.  WE
THINK NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MILITARY COMMAND SHOULD BE MADE AT
PRESENT BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION.  SHOULD ANY CHANGES BE MADE,
IT WOULD BE FOR MAJOR REASONS IN THE SERVICE. NO HIGH-LEVEL CHANGES
HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED, HOWEVER. [END RECORDING]

   REFERRING TO THE REBELS' ACTIVITIES, COL PONCE SAID THE ARMED
ACTIONS INITIATED, PARTICULARLY IN SAN SALVADOR ON 11 NOVEMBER, HAVE
ENDED WITH UNFAVORABLE RESULTS FOR THE GUERRILLAS.  HE ADVISED,
HOWEVER, THAT THE GUERRILLAS WILL CONTINUE TO SABOTAGE THE COUNTRY'S
ECONOMY AND PERPETRATE TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FMLN HAS FAILED,
MILITARILY SPEAKING.  THE FMLN'S FAMOUS ALL - THE - WAY OFFENSIVE HAS
ENDED IN TREMENDOUS FAILURE, DETERMINED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE
CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THE FMLN WILL CONTINUE ITS SABOTAGING ACTIONS AND
TERRORISM WHICH COULD DESTROY STORES IN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS POSTS
AND PYLONS ON HIGHWAYS. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CAN REST ASSURED,
HOWEVER, THAT AN OFFENSIVE ACTION BY THE FMLN AT PRESENT CAN BE
DISREGARDED. [END RECORDING]

   REGARDING THE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR FESTIVITIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN
MARRED BY THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE, MANY PEOPLE HAVE WONDERED WHETHER THE
2300 - TO - 0500 CURFEW IS STILL IN FORCE.  PONCE SAID THE POSSIBILITY
OF LIFTING THE CURFEW AT LEAST ON 24 AND 31 DECEMBER IS BEING
CONSIDERED SO THAT THE SALVADORAN FAMILIES CAN ENJOY THESE
FESTIVITIES.  HE ADDED THAT SUCH A MEASURE, HOWEVER, WILL DEPEND ON
THE FMLN'S STANCE.  FINALLY, PONCE REPORTED THAT THE FMLN
MACHINEGUNNED A BUILDING WITH COFFEE HARVESTERS IN SANTA ANA AND
MAIMED TWO PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO STOP HARVESTING
COFFEE.

TOMAS HOSPITAL HAVE ACCUSED THE U.S. INVADING TROOPS OF PREVENTING
AMBULANCES FROM TRANSITING AND PROVIDING MEDICAL ATTENTION TO THE MANY
WOUNDED IN STRATEGIC SECTORS OF THE PANAMANIAN CAPITAL.

   JORGE DIAZ, MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE HOSPITAL, TOLD THE COLOMBIAN
RADIO STATION CARACOL THAT THE FOREIGN SOLDIERS ARE FIRING MACHINEGUNS
AT AMBULANCES THAT ARE PASSING THOUGH THE CITY.

   ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR, THE HOSPITAL, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN
PANAMA, HAS RECEIVED ABOUT 50 DEAD, WHILE OVER 100 ARE RECOVERING FROM
SERIOUS WOUNDS.

   HE SAID THAT ONLY SIX OR SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE DEFENSE FORCES HAVE
BEEN TAKEN THERE; THUS MOST OF THE VICTIMS ARE INHABITANTS OF
LOW-INCOME AREAS SHELLED BY U.S. AIRPLANES.

   "FROM THE SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL, WE HEARD THE BOMB EXPLOSIONS.  MANY
HOMES ARE ON FIRE, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN AN INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK," DIAZ
SAID.

   SIMILARLY, ALFONSO ZAMORA, DPA CORRESPONDENT IN PANAMA CITY, SAID
DRAMATICALLY TO THE COLOMBIAN STATION: "WE ARE ON THE FLOOR." HE SAID
THE EXCHANGE OF FIRE HAS INTENSIFIED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL.

MILITARY FORCES' ACTION IN PANAMA, WHICH IT DESCRIBED AS A "FLAGRANT
VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES," BUT SAID THAT IT WAS GENERAL
MANUEL NORIEGA'S "UNDEMOCRATIC STUBBORNNESS THAT CAUSED THE SITUATION
TO DETERIORATE TO THIS POINT."

   IN A COMMUNIQUE READ BY FOREIGN MINISTER DIEGO CORDOVEZ, WHO WAS
HEAD OF THE OAS MISSION THAT TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MEDIATE IN
PANAMA'S POLITICAL CRISIS, THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT DEMANDED AN
IMMEDIATE END TO THE "FOREIGN INTERVENTION" AND "FULL RESPECT FOR
PANAMANIAN INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY."

   HOWEVER, THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED IT "ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY" THAT A "DEMOCRATIC REGIME" RESTORE INSTITUTIONAL NORMALCY
IN PANAMA AND GUARANTEE RESPECT FOR THE TORRIJOS - CARTER TREATIES.

   AFTER A PRIVATE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA, CORDOVEZ
REITERATED THE OFFICIAL OFFER TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY NEGOTIATING
EFFORTS THAT MIGHT BE INITIATED "TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT IN PANAMA."

   BY MANDATE OF THE ASSEMBLY OF AMERICAN FOREIGN MINISTERS, IN MAY
AND AUGUST CORDOVEZ HEADED EFFORTS TO FIND A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO
THE CRISIS GENERATED BY THE REGIME'S ANNULMENT OF THE 7 MAY ELECTIONS,
PRESUMABLY TO PREVENT WHAT WAS ANNOUNCED AS A CLEAR OPPOSITION
VICTORY.

   "INTENSIVE EFFORTS WERE MADE TO PREVENT THE CONFLICT THAT HAS
EXPLODED TODAY," CORDOVEZ SAID.  HE REITERATED HIS "BROADEST
WILLINGNESS" TO "CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE SEARCH FOR A NONVIOLENT
SOLUTION."

INTERVENTION BY THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL POWER DIRECTED AGAINST A
SMALL PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CONFRONT THE MILITARY
MIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES.  ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS AGENCIES

   [CERDA] IN PANAMA CITY.  INTERNATIONAL PRESS DISPATCHES HAVE
MENTIONED THIS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE SOCIAL COST SO FAR?  IS THERE SOME ESTIMATE?

   [CERDA] WELL, INTERNATIONAL DISPATCHES SPEAK OF 50 DEAD, MOSTLY

BROKE OUT THIS EVENING IN CIUDAD MERLIOT, AN AREA WEST OF SAN

   THE FIGHTING BEGAN AT 1830 (0030 GMT) WHEN FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] COLUMNS ENTERED CIUDAD MERLIOT, A MIDDLE CLASS
NEIGHBORHOOD LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 12 KM SOUTHWEST OF SAN SALVADOR.

ROCKETS AGAINST SUPPOSED REBEL POSITIONS.

   THE SHOOTING COULD BE HEARD IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR. MEANWHILE,
RESIDENTS OF THE AFFECTED AREAS TOLD LOCAL RADIO STATIONS THAT THERE
WAS HEAVY SHOOTING.

   THE ARMED ACTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN

DISTRICT THIS AFTERNOON, PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA REITERATED HIS REJECTION AND
THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE'S CONDEMNATION OF THE INVASION OF PANAMA BY U.S.  TROOPS.

   THE HEAD OF STATE DESCRIBED THIS ACTION AS AN ACT OF ROBBERY AND
PIRACY.  HE NOTED THAT THIS REPRESENTS AGGRESSION NOT ONLY AGAINST THE
PANAMANIAN PEOPLE BUT AGAINST THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ALL LATIN AMERICA.

   GARCIA SAID THAT THIS INSULT AND OUTRAGE AGAINST SOVEREIGN PEOPLES
CANNOT OCCUR ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE 21ST CENTURY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GARCIA] A DRAMATIC EVENT IS SHAKING ALL LATIN
AMERICA AT THIS MOMENT. BEGINNING EARLY THIS MORNING, THE INVADING
FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE PENETRATED AND INTERVENED
IN LATIN AMERICAN TERRITORY IN PANAMA.

   THIS IS WHY I AM LATE, BECAUSE SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING WE HAVE
BEEN WITNESSING AN ASTONISHING ACT OF IMPERIALIST ROBBERY AND PIRACY
TARNISHING THE SACRED SOIL OF PANAMA AND LATIN AMERICA.

   WE ARE JUST LATIN AMERICANS. IF A LATIN AMERICAN IS OFFENDED AND
ATTACKED, THEN WE ARE ALL OFFENDED AND ATTACKED. AND YOU, THE HUANCA
PEASANTS, MUST KNOW THAT IN PANAMA IN THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] THERE ARE
ALSO PEASANTS WHO ARE NOW THE VICTIMS OF THE U.S. INVASION. AND WE
MUST STAND UP TO RESCUE [WORDS DROWNED OUT CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

   SEVENTY YEARS ELAPSED BEFORE GENERAL OMAR TORRIJOS MANAGED TO SIGN
AN AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER FOR THE PANAMA CANAL TO BE
TURNED OVER TO PANAMANIAN SOVEREIGNTY.  SINCE THAT 1977 TREATY,
HOWEVER, MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND EFFORTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MADE
TO PREVENT THE CANAL FROM BEING RETURNED TO LATIN AMERICA.

   THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE CANAL ZONE WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR
TROOPS, THEIR AIRPLANES, AND THEIR BOMBS TO THREATEN THE CONTINENT AND
TELL ALL OF US THAT IF WE DO NOT BEHAVE WELL THEY CAN INVADE US AT ANY
MOMENT.

   I CANNOT ACCEPT WHAT WAS DONE THIS MORNING WHEN THE NEW PRESIDENT
OF PANAMA WAS SWORN IN ON A U.S. BASE IN THE CANAL ZONE.  THE
AMERICANS DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY WHO IS GOING TO GOVERN IN LATIN
AMERICA; ONLY THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE THEIR
DESTINY.  APPLAUSE AND CHEERS

   IN THE LAST 14 HOURS, 24,000 MEN AND MORE THAN 100 COMBAT VEHICLES
HAVE ENTERED PANAMA CITY, AND THE HELICOPTERS HAVE ATTACKED MILITARY
INSTALLATIONS ADJACENT TO THE CIVILIAN ZONES.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT
HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN KILLED.  AS PRESIDENT OF PERU, AS A CHIEF OF STATE,
AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE POOR PEASANTS I CANNOT SILENCE OUR
PROTEST.  I CANNOT SILENCE OUR CONDEMNATION.

   I CALL ON THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE; I CALL ON THE YOUTH OF LATIN
AMERICA IN THE FACE OF THIS IMPERIALISTIC ATTACK.  WE CANNOT REMAIN
SILENT.  WE MAY BE POOR, WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS, BUT WE ARE DIGNIFIED

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] DOES NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST
CHANCE TO LAUNCH A NEW OFFENSIVE BECAUSE THE RANK-AND-FILE OF THIS
ORGANIZATION ARE TOTALLY DEMORALIZED DUE TO THE HEAVY CASUALTIES THAT THEY
HAVE TAKEN.  HE ADDED THAT THESE CASUALTIES INCLUDE NINE "COMMANDERS."

   COL PONCE ADDED: "THE ARMED FORCES HAVE DEFEATED THE FMLN IN THE
NORTHERN ZONE AND IN SOYAPANGO, SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL AND MORAZAN,
CAUSING IN THE PROCESS OVER 2,000 CASUALTIES INCLUDING SEVERAL
COMMANDERS AND MERCENARIES."

   THE FMLN HAS PUBLICLY ADMITTED THAT "COMMANDERS" HERNAN SOLORZANO
("DIMAS RODRIGUEZ"), JORGE ORLANDO SANDOVAL ("OSCAR"), GEOMAR ARI
("CIRILO"), OVIDIO LOPEZ ("ORLANDO MORALES"), AND "POLITICAL OFFICERS"
JOSE SANTOS LLANES ("PEPE") AND MILAGROS ALVARADO ("JUDY"), HAVE BEEN
KILLED.

   TERRORIST LEADERS MISAEL GALLARDO, NICOLAS ALBERTO SARAVIA, AND
RICARDO MIRANDA HAVE ALSO BEEN KILLED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE
FAILED FMLN OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   COL PONCE REPORTED THAT MANY MERCENARIES, INCLUDING SOME WHO LOOKED
EUROPEAN, DIED DURING THE CLASH WITH THE ARMY IN COLONIA ESCALON.
PONCE ADDED THAT THE FAMILIES OF THESE MERCENARIES ARE NOW INQUIRING
ABOUT THEM IN NICARAGUA.

   COL PONCE BELIEVES THAT THE SABOTAGE WHICH THE FMLN IS CARRYING OUT
BY BURNING BUSSES, DESTROYING POWER PYLONS, AND STAGING SMALL- SCALE
ATTACKS, ARE MERELY THE "LAST KICKS" OF A DROWNING PERSON.

   ASSISTED BY THE AIR FORCE, THE SALVADORAN ARMY CONTINUES TO STRIKE
AT THE FEW TERRORISTS STRONGHOLDS IN THE NORTH, PARTS OF THE CAPITAL,
AND OTHER AREAS IN THE INTERIOR.

   PONCE INDICATED THAT THE FMLN IS SPREADING LIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO
MAINTAIN ITS CREDIBILITY AND TO COVER UP THE HEAVY CASUALTIES IT HAS
TAKEN.  THE CASUALTIES REALLY NUMBER OVER 2,000 ALTHOUGH THE FMLN
CLAIMS ONLY TO HAVE LOST 400 PEOPLE.

   THE OFFICIAL ARMED FORCES REPORT ISSUED ON 30 NOVEMBER STATES THAT
THE FMLN SUSTAINED 2,132 KILLED IN ACTION DURING THE OFFENSIVE WHILE
THE GOVERNMENT LOST 476 TROOPS.

   COL PONCE ADDED THAT THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES INTO THE DEATH OF
FOUR PEOPLE WHO DIED IN THE CRASH OF A PLANE THAT WAS BRINGING ARMS
FOR THE FMLN FROM NICARAGUA.  THE CRASH OCCURED IN AN ISOLATED AREA OF
USULUTAN DEPARTMENT.

   UNTIL YESTERDAY THE FMLN HAD NOT ADMITTED THAT THE CREW OF THE
PLANE CARRYING ARMS THAT CRASHED ON 25 SEPTEMBER BELONGED TO TERRORIST
GROUPS.  ACCORDING TO THE FMLN THE CREW MEMBERS WERE SALVADORANS.

   THE TERRORISTS REPORTED THAT THE DEAD CREWMEN WERE PILOT OSVALDO
ALFARO AGUINADA, ALSO KNOWN AS "LUIS" AND "ANTIAIRCRAFT GUNNERS" ROMEL
HERNANDEZ ARGUETA ("HELO"), ISIDRO PARADA MARTINEZ ("DENIS"), AND

SURE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA DOES NOT GET BLAMED IN THE LIGHT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE AGAINST HIM BECAUSE OF HIS SUBVERSIVE CAMPAIGN
IN AREA COUNTRIES."

   PONCE ADDED THAT THE CURRENT STRATEGY OF THE DEFEATED FMLN IS
LIMITED TO TALKING ABOUT FALSE VICTORIES TO NEWS MEDIA THAT THEY
CONTROL, SO AS NOT TO DEMORALIZE THEIR RANK-AND-FILE; TO REFUTING ARMY
REPORTS; AND TO DISSEMINATING FALSE FIGURES ON CASUALTIES ALLEGEDLY
INFLICTED TO THE ARMY.

THE THEIR BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS ON MARISCAL STREET IN THIS CAPITAL.

   ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, THE
VICTIMS WERE TWO CANADIAN WOMEN AND AN AMERICAN MALE CITIZEN.

   THE REPORT STATES THAT THE THREE MEMBERS WERE RETURNING TO THEIR
HEADQUARTERS WHEN THEY WERE INTERCEPTED AND ATTACKED BY TWO YOUNG MEN
WHO STABBED THEM.  THE AGGRESSORS FIRST STABBED THE TWO WOMEN IN THE
CHEST, CAUSING DEEP WOUNDS.  THE AMERICAN MAN TRIED TO DEFEND THE TWO
WOMEN BUT HE SUFFERED CUTS ON HIS HANDS AND WRISTS, AND AROUND HIS
WAIST.

   THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES IN GUATEMALA REPORT STATES:

   WE CONSIDER THAT THE ATTACK ON THEIR MEMBERS REPRESENTS AN ACTION
OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST THIS ORGANIZATION AND THE HUMANITARIAN TASK IT
CARRIES OUT IN GUATEMALA.  THE AGGRESSORS DID NOT ASK FOR MONEY OR TRY
TO STEAL ANYTHING FROM THE THREE VICTIMS.  DURING THE ATTACK THE WOMEN
DROPPED THEIR PURSES AND THE ATTACKERS DID NOT TRY TO STEAL THEM.

   WE CONSIDER THAT THIS IS ANOTHER ATTACK IN THE ESCALATION OF
VIOLENCE TO INTIMIDATE THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, WHOSE
PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN RECEIVING DEATH THREATS SINCE MAY.  TWO GRENADES
WERE HURLED AT THE ORGANIZATION'S HEADQUARTERS IN AUGUST.

   THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES ARE AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TO SEND PLANES THAT COULD ALSO BRING
FOOD AND MEDICINE TO THE PANAMANIANS.

   CASTRO ARENAS, WHO HAS BEEN IN LIMA SINCE AUGUST THIS YEAR,
RECALLED BY HIS GOVERNMENT, SAID THAT EARLY THIS MORNING HE RECEIVED A
DESPERATE CALL FROM A GROUP OF PERUVIAN CITIZENS WHO WERE AFRAID THAT
THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE ATTACKED BY A MOB OF PANAMANIANS.

   THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THAT THERE IS "WIDESPREAD LOOTING" IN
PANAMA BECAUSE THE POOREST PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY, AND HE ADDED THAT THE
SITUATION IS ONE OF "CHAOS AND ANARCHY AND NOT OF TRANQUILLITY AS THE
PEOPLE IN LIMA BELIEVE."

   CASTRO ARENAS EXPLAINED THAT THE ATTACKS ON BUILDINGS FROM WHICH
U.S. SOLDIERS ARE BEING RESISTED IS CONSTANTLY THREATENING THE

   ACCORDING TO THE AMBASSADOR, THE PERUVIAN DIPLOMATS ARE ALL BLOCKED
AT THEIR HOMES; THEIR CARS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY, AND ONE OF THEM HAS
BEEN WOUNDED BY A GUNSHOT.

DECEMBER, PRESIDENTS OF FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES HELD A SPECIAL
MEETING TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLAS.  BUT SO
FAR NO AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED BY BOTH SIDES ON BRINGING ABOUT A
CEASE-FIRE DURING CHRISTMAS.  THEIR 1-MONTH-LONG FIERCE BATTLE HAS LEFT
3,000 PEOPLE DEAD AND ALSO CAST A SHADOW OVER THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE
PROCESS.

   THE CURRENT CIVIL WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS TRIGGERED OFF BY THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE LABOR FEDERATION, THE COUNTRY'S
BIGGEST TRADE UNION ORGANIZATION.  ON 31 OCTOBER, AN ULTRARIGHTIST
"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD" SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY USED
A HEAVY BOMB TO BOMBARD THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING OF THE LABOR
FEDERATION, KILLING AND WOUNDING OVER 40 PEOPLE INCLUDING PRINCIPAL
LEADERS OF THE FEDERATION.  ON 2 NOVEMBER, THE GUERRILLAS ISSUED A
STATEMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ACTIVITY OF THE SQUAD AND
DECLARING THE CANCELLATION OF THE THIRD ROUND OF TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT SCHEDULED IN VENEZUELA.  ON THE SAME NIGHT THE GUERRILLAS
LAUNCHED A LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE "TO ELIMINATE FASCISM."  ABOUT 8,000
GUERRILLAS SWIFTLY CAPTURED MANY TOWNS AND STRATEGIC POSITIONS
NORTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL AND CUT KEY COMMUNICATIONS LINES BETWEEN THE
CAPITAL AND THE HINTERLAND.  IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ALSO ATTACKED SOME
50 GOVERNMENT ARMY BASES AND POLICE STATIONS IN THE HINTERLAND, THUS
CONTROLLING 30 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY.  THEY HAVE
ESTABLISHED "LOCAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENTS" IN 8 OF THE 14 PROVINCES
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  DURING THIS PERIOD, THE GOVERNMENT DISPATCHED
ARMORED CARS AND AIR FORCE UNITS TO CARRY OUT COUNTERATTACKS.  THEY
WANTONLY BOMBARDED THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY
OCCUPIED BY THE GUERRILLAS.  AFTER 8 DAYS OF FIERCE BATTLE, THE
GUERRILLAS SHOT DOWN 12 GOVERNMENT FIGHTER PLANES AND HELICOPTERS;
DESTROYED 34 TANKS, ARMORED CARS, AND PATROL CARS; AND CAPTURED A
LARGE AMOUNT OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION.  SUBSEQUENTLY BATTLES CONTINUED
IN REGIONS OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL CITY.  SINCE EARLY DECEMBER BOTH SIDES
HAVE ENGAGED IN FIERCE BATTLES IN THE CAPITAL CITY AND THE HINTERLAND.
THE GUERRILLAS USED MORTARS TO ATTACK THE BUILDING OF THE GOVERNMENT
ARMY GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS, THE U.S.  EMBASSY, AND THE
PRESIDENTIAL RESTAURANT, WHEREAS THE GOVERNMENT ARMY DISPATCHED PLANES
TO BOMBARD THE GUERRILLA POSITIONS.  FIERCE BATTLES HAVE ALSO BROKEN
OUT IN CHALATENANGO, SAN MIGUEL, AND OTHER TOWNS, THEREBY CAUSING
HEAVY CASUALTIES AND PROPERTY LOSSES.

   THIS WAR HAS DEEP-ROOTED CAUSES.  EL SALVADOR IS A SMALL COUNTRY
WITH AN AREA OF 21,000 SQUARE KM AND A POPULATION OF 5 MILLION.
DURING THIS 10-YEAR-LONG WAR, 70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND THE NATIONAL
ECONOMY HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY DESTROYED.  THE ULTRARIGHTIST NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] WON THE GENERAL ELECTION EARLY THIS YEAR,
THUS AGGRAVATING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE
GOVERNMENT.  PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, THE GUERRILLAS PUT FORWARD A PEACE
PROPOSAL DEMANDING SIX MONTHS' POSPONEMENT OF THE ELECTION SO AS TO
MAKE THEIR PARTICIPATION POSSIBLE.  BUT THIS PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED BY
THE GOVERNMENT.  BECAUSE ALMOST HALF OF THE VOTERS DID NOT VOTE, THE
GUERRILLAS DECLARED IT DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.
PRESSED BY DOMESTIC PUBLIC OPINION AND URGED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PEACE AGREEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS HELD TWO ROUNDS OF
TALKS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER.  DURING THEIR TALKS THE GUERRILLAS
DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT STOP ITS SUPPRESSION, INTRODUCE
POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND JUDICIAL REFORMS, REORGANIZE THE ARMED
FORCES, AND PUNISH THE "DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD."  THE GOVERNMENT INSISTED
THAT THE GUERRILLAS SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS BEFORE REFORMS WERE
CARRIED OUT.  THE HARD-LINE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT REFLECTED THE
ESTABLISHED POLICY OF THE RULING PARTY, WHICH HAS ALL ALONG STOOD FOR
RULING THE COUNTRY BY MILITARY MEANS, ADVOCATED THE SUPPRESSION OF
DEMOCRATIC FORCES, AND SUPPORTED THE "DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD" IN CARRYING
OUT ASSASSINATION.  A UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT IN CENTRAL AMERICA WAS
ASSASSINATED BY THE SQUAD FOR CRITICIZING THE ULTRARIGHTIST POLICY OF
THE RULING PARTY.  RECENTLY THE RULING PARTY SUPPORTED THE
"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD" IN ATTACKING THE LABOR FEDERATION'S BUILDING.
THIS IGNITED THE CURRENT CIVIL WAR AND UNDERMINED THE PEACE PROCESS IN
THE COUNTRY. THE GUERRILLAS ISSUED A STATEMENT ON 12 DECEMBER
CONDEMNING THE MEETING OF THE FIVE HEADS OF STATE FOR BEING PARTIAL TO
THE ULTRARIGHTIST SALVADORIAN GOVERNMENT.  THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT
THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT ANY EFFORT TO DISSOLVE THE GUERRILLA FORCES AND
WOULD CARRY ON THEIR STRUGGLE.  [CONTINUED]

   DURING A MESSAGE DELIVERED THROUGH A NATIONAL NETWORK, CEREZO SAID
THAT "CHRISTMAS IS A SPECIAL TIME TO SIT AROUND WITH THE FAMILY AND
REFLECT UPON THE FUTURE AND THE GOALS ONE WISHES TO ATTAIN."

   PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID: "I WOULD LIKE TO REFLECT WITH YOU, BECAUSE
WHEN ONE TAKES A LOOK AROUND THE WORLD, ONE SEES THE GREAT
DIFFICULTIES THAT MANY COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING TO ACHIEVE AND
BUILD DEMOCRACY."

   CEREZO MENTIONED THE CASE OF ROMANIA, WHERE WORKERS WHO WERE
DEMONSTRATING TO DEMAND WAGE INCREASES AND A DEMOCRATIZING PROCESS
WERE SHOT BY THE SECURITY FORCES RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF DEAD AND
WOUNDED.

   CEREZO ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE CRISIS PANAMA IS CURRENTLY
EXPERIENCING AND SAID THAT NOW THE "PANAMANIAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
HAVE A VERY SAD CHRISTMAS AND WILL FACE MANY DIFFICULTIES TO GET
FOOD."

   PRESIDENT CEREZO STRESSED THAT "PROBLEMS SHOULD BE SOLVED THROUGH
DIALOGUE, THAT WAR SHOULD BE AVOIDED AND THAT GUATEMALA MUST PREVENT
DISASTER FROM REACHING THE COUNTRY, AS HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER NATIONS."

   CEREZO ADMITTED THAT GUATEMALA IS PAYING A HIGH PRICE TO SOLVE ITS
ECONOMIC SITUATION, BUT HE STRESSED THAT ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD
HAD TO PAY HIGH PRICES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS.

   CEREZO STRESSED THAT "JAPAN, WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXPERIENCED A WORLD WAR.  GERMANY ALSO
EXPERIENCED DIFFICULT TIMES AND LEARNED THE LESSON THAT THE WAR DID
NOT BRING ANY BENEFITS TO THEM."

   CEREZO SAID THAT THE 4 YEARS OF HIS GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS
INAUGURATED IN JANUARY 1986, "HAVE BEEN TRULY INTERESTING."  HE SAID
THAT HE HAS FACED PROBLEMS AND THAT HE HAS BEEN CRITICIZED, BUT HE
ADDED THAT THE CRISIS, HOWEVER, IS BEING SOLVED THROUGH DIALOGUE.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO ADDED THAT THE ECONOMIC MEASURES ADOPTED BY HIS
GOVERNMENT HAVE INCREASED THE COST OF LIVING.  CEREZO SAID THAT
GUATEMALA IS ONE OF THE THREE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE
REGISTERED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE BUSINESSES, STORES,
AND EMPLOYMENT HERE.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 25 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] ECUADORAN EMBASSY SOURCES
HAVE REPORTED THAT 55 ECUADOREANS, INCLUDING ECUADORAN AGRICULTURE MINISTER
MARIO JALIL, WERE EVACUATED LAST NIGHT FROM PANAMA IN AN AIRPLANE FROM THEIR
COUNTRY.

   THE AIRPLANE, WHICH IS THE FIRST TO LAND IN PANAMA AFTER THE U.S.
MILITARY INTERVENTION, LANDED A CARGO OF MEDICINE AT OMAR TORRIJOS
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, AFTER FIRST HAVING LANDED AT THE U.S. HOWARD
AIR BASE.

   AN ECUADORAN DIPLOMAT SAID THAT "THE AIRPORT SMELLED OF DEAD
BODIES."  THE NEARBY TOCUMEN AIR BASE WAS THE BATTLEGROUND FOR HARSH
CLASHES BETWEEN U.S. AND PANAMANIAN TROOPS, AND IT WAS BOMBED BY THE
UNITED STATES.

   AN AIRPLANE FROM MEXICO ALSO ARRIVED IN PANAMA LAST NIGHT BRINGING
FOOD AND MEDICINE, BUT WITH THE PURPOSE OF EVACUATING MEXICAN CITIZENS
BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY.

   OTHER AIRPLANES FROM SPAIN, COLOMBIA, GERMANY, AND SEVERAL OTHER
EUROPEAN AND LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES ARE WAITING FOR U.S. SOUTHERN
COMMAND AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER PANAMANIAN AIR SPACE AND LAND IN
PANAMA.

MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE CHILEAN
COMMUNITY AND DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL IN ROMANIA ARE SAFE AND SOUND.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT OF
FIDEL CASTRO IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD, ALONG WITH ALBANIA, THAT
HAS NOT UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE ARE NEW WINDS OF LIBERTY AND PROGRESS
BLOWING.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER POINTED OUT THAT IT IS QUITE NORMAL FOR
FIDEL CASTRO TO IGNORE THIS FACT BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN IN POWER FOR THE
PAST 30 YEARS.

   REGARDING CHILE'S RELATIONS WITH PANAMA, THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID
THAT HE IS VERY SATISFIED THAT THE SITUATION IS RETURNING TO NORMAL IN
THAT COUNTRY.  HE ALSO SAID THAT IT IS A VERY POSITIVE SIGN THAT SHIPS
WITH CHILEAN EXPORTS WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME NORMAL USE OF THE PANAMA
CANAL BEGINNING ON 27 DECEMBER, AS THESE SHIPS HAD BEEN HELD BACK.

   LIMA, 25 DEC 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT GARCIA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[GARCIA] WHEN I APPLY ALL MY ARGUMENTATIVE AND RETHORICAL ENERGY TO
THE SUBJECT OF PANAMA, AND I DO SO WITH ABSOLUTE SINCERITY, NOT SIMPLY
TO TAKE A STANCE, BUT BECAUSE AS A LATIN AMERICAN I FEEL GREATLY
OFFENDED IN A WAY THAT YOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND.  I FEEL TERRIBLY
OFFENDED.  IF I MAKE DEMANDS AND IF I CONDEMN, I KNOW THAT NOBODY WILL
QUICKLY FOLLOW ME DOWN THIS ROAD OF FIRMNESS AND CONDEMNATION. BUT
THIS IS A SECONDARY ASPECT. I WISH I WERE FOLLOWED, BUT IF AM NOT,
THIS DOES NOT DETRACT FROM THE JUSTICE OF WHAT I AM DOING. ONE TRIES
TO DO WHAT IS INTRINSICALLY GOOD, NOT SIMPLY WHAT ONE CAN NECESSARILY
WIN.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [GARCIA] PARDON ME. IT WOULD BE WORSE IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT.  IT
WOULD BE LESS EFFECTIVE, THOUGH IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT EFFECTIVE. DON'T
BE UNJUST.  IT WOULD BE EVEN LESS EFFECTIVE IF WE ALL REMAINED SILENT
AND SAID: YES, UNCLE SAM, YOU ARE THE MASTER AND WE MUST OBEY. WE ARE
THE UNCLE TOM IN LATIN AMERICA.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [GARCIA] LOOK, I DON'T EXPECT....[CHANGES THOUGHT] WE DON'T HAVE TO
MIX THEM [PASSAGE INDISTINCT]. WE CONTINUE OUR NEGOTIATION WITH THE
IMF, AND THAT TO ME STILL SEEMS VERY POSITIVE. MAY IT NOT TURN OUT AS
THE ILLUSION I HAD THAT RELATIONS WERE CHANGING AT THE POLTICAL LEVEL.
FIRST, I WOULD NOT ALLOW A HARDENING OF PERU ATTITUDE TOWARD THE
UNITED STATES.  THERE IS A HARDENING WHEN ONE SLAPS SOMEONE ELSE IN
THE FACE.  IN THIS CASE WE HAVE A CONCRETE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION.
THERE IS A GREAT ISSUE TO DISCUSS BETWEEN LATIN AMERICA AND THE UNITED
STATES.  YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO INVADE.  WHO CALLED YOU?  ENDARA
HIMSELF HAD TO SAY -- BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE
THINKING, THOUGH A PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE INDIFFERENT -- THAT HE DID
NOT CALL THEM.  DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?  PRESIDENT ENDARA SAYS
THAT HE DIDN'T CALL FOR THE INVASION.  THIS SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY
UNDERSTOOD. FOR SOME REASON HE SAID IT.  SO I WOULD NOT CALL IT A
HARDENING. I BEG YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE EXACT SHADE OF THE TERM. WE ARE
ENERGIC IN OPPOSING A CONCRETE FACT, BUT WHAT DO THE PEOPLE OF NEW
HAMPSHIRE, THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA, THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, THE PEOPLE
OF JEFFERSON, OF WHITMAN, OF LINCLON -- THAT GREAT DEFENDER OF HUMAN
RIGHTS AND RACIAL EQUALITY -- WHAT HAVE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THAT ACT?
WE HAVE TO RESPECT THE GREATNESS OF THE UNITED STATES. FROM LATIN
AMERICA, THE UNITED STATES IS SEEN IN VARIOUS WAYS. FOR THE TIME
BEING, I SEE IT AS THE ROME OF THE MODERN WORLD. I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT THE LATIN AMERICANS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD INSIDE THE UNITED STATES.
THE LATIN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE HAS TO SEEN INSIDE THE UNITED STATES.
THEN A SOUND RELATIONSHINP WILL EMERGE BETWEEN THE TWO CONTINENTS.
BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS THE ROME OF THE MODERN WORLD -- FOR THE
CAPACITY OF ITS ATOMIC LEGIONS; FOR THEIR HAVING CONCENTRATED SCIENCE
AND PHILOSOPHY, ALTHOUGH BOTH WERE BROUGHT OVER FROM EUROPE AS THE
ROMANS BROUGHT THEM FROM GREECE; FOR THEIR HAVING GENERATED AN
EXTRAORDINARY TECHNOLOGY, AND FOR THEIR BEING A DEMOCRACY -- THE
UNITED STATES MUST BE RESPECTED.  WE WILL HAVE TO DISTINGUISH ALL THAT
FROM A PARTICULAR ACT BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS WHY WE SAY
AMERICANS REFERRING TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND SAY YANKEE
TO DEFINE SOME ACTS BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. SO I DON'T BELIEVE,
SIR, THAT THERE IS A HARDENING, AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THEY
UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL. I BELIEVE THEY UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TELL THEM
THAT I CANNOT SIT AT THE TABLE WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE KILLING
PANAMANIAN PEOPLE. LET THE MINISTERS, THE POLICE CHIEFS, THE
PROSECUTORS, THE ATTORNEY GENERALS SIT AT A TABLE.  THAT IS GOOD.  BUT
THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION?  DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN? I
THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN IT. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT
WOULD BE A BAD THING FOR MR MANTILLA TO SIT WITH MR BENNETT OR WITH
THE JUSTICE MINISTER OF COLOMBIA. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE BAD.
THIS IS THE PROOF THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE THE ANTIDRUG PLAN. BUT
THOSE WHO PERSONIFY THE NATION CANNOT MEET.  WE CANNOT DO SO UNDER THE
PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  SO THIS IS NOT HARDENING.  AS FOR THE IMF, I
BELIEVE THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT MATTER.  THESE MATTERS ARE
WELL DIFFERENTIATED. I AM NOT HERE AS A DEMAGOGUE, AS SOME RIGHT WING
MEDIA ASSERT.  THOSE PEOPLE ARE FIGHTENED WHEN I DRAW A LOT OF PEOPLE
DESPITE MY POLTICAL DECLINE.  I AM NOT BEING A DEMAGOGUE, AND I AM NOT
HERE BECAUSE THE BEST WAY TO WIN VOTES IS TO INDULGE IN ANTI-AMERICAN
POLITICS FROM HERE UNTIL 28 JULY 1990. I WILL NOT LAPSE INTO THAT
IRRESPONSIBILITY. HERE WE HAVE A CONCRETE FACT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH OUR CULTURAL, COMMERCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH
ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THE UNITED STATES MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE INFLUENCE.
I SEPARATE THINGS VERY WELL.  [CONTINUED]

   BUENOS AIRES, 28 DEC 89 (TELAM) -- [TEXT] THE ARGENTINE CHAMBER OF
DEPUTIES TODAY "STRONGLY REPUDIATED" THE U.S. MILITARY INTERVENTION IN
PANAMA BY APPROVING A DECLARATION SPONSORED BY THE JUSTICIALIST PARTY
(PJ) AND THE RADICAL CIVIC UNION (UCR) BLOCS.  THE PROPOSAL MET WITH
STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE DEMOCRATIC CENTRIST UNION (UCEDE) DEPUTIES.

   THE DECLARATION PROPOSED BY PJ DEPUTY JUAN PABLO CAFIERO CALLS FOR
THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.S. TROOPS THAT INVADED PANAMA TO
OUST GENERAL MANUEL NORIEGA'S GOVERNMENT.

   IT ALSO URGES THE UNITED STATES TO "STRICTLY COMPLY WITH THE
TORRIJOS-CARTER TREATIES" ON THE FUTURE OF THE PANAMA CANAL.  THE
DECLARATION REJECTS ALL TYPES OF DICTATORIAL REGIMES, IMPLICITLY
REFERRING TO NORIEGA.

   THIS STATEMENT WAS INCLUDED IN THE DECLARATION AT THE SUGGESTION OF
FEDERAL PARTY DEPUTY RUTH MONJARDIN AFTER OBTAINING THE SUPPORT OF
JOSE MANZANO, THE SPEAKER FOR THE PJ BLOC; SATURNINO ARANA (PJ),
CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE; AND UCR DEPUTY DANTE
CAPUTO.

   THE DECLARATION ALSO RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF INTRANSIGENT PARTY
DEPUTY OSCAR ALENDE, CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEPUTY HECTOR GATTI,
AND POPULAR DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEPUTY ALBERTO ARAMOUNI.  DEPUTY LUIS
ZAMORA OF THE MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM REJECTED THE DECLARATION ON
THE GROUNDS THAT IT WAS MEANINGLESS "TO ASK ANYTHING OF A COUNTRY THAT
IS KILLING PANAMANIANS."

   THE UCEDE OPPOSED THE DECLARATION, AND BLOC SPEAKER FEDERICO
CLERICI WAS MOCKED BY PJ AND UCR DEPUTIES WHEN HE READ AN ALTERNATE
DECLARATION PREPARED BY UCEDE DEPUTY ADELINA DALESSIO DE VIOLA, WHICH
URGED THE GOVERNMENTS OF BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND PANAMA TO "STOP
USING VIOLENCE."

   UCEDE DEPUTY FRANCISCO DURANONA Y VEDIA CRITICIZED THE DECLARATION
BY STATING THAT IT IMPLIED SUPPORT FOR GENERAL NORIEGA'S REGIME.
DEPUTY FEDERICO ZAMORA, ALSO FROM THE UCEDE, LAMENTED THAT "THERE ARE
SO MANY FORGETFUL PEOPLE HERE.  A LOT IS BEING SAID ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED IN PANAMA, BUT NOTHING IS BEING SAID ABOUT ROMANIA."

   FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER AND UCR DEPUTY DANTE CAPUTO SUPPORTED THE
DECLARATION AND SAID THAT "TO ACCEPT THE U.S. INVASION WOULD BE
TANTAMOUNT TO ADMITTING THAT THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS," ADDING THAT
SUCH IDEAS MUST BE REJECTED, EVEN THOUGH PANAMA MAY HAVE HAD AN
"ILLEGAL, DICTATORIAL AND CORRUPT" GOVERNMENT.

   TOWARD THE END OF THE DEBATE, PJ BLOC SPEAKER JOSE MANZANO SAID
THAT "BY CRITICIZING THIS SAVAGERY WE SEEK TO HELP RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA [LE HACEMOS UN FAVOR A LA RELACION
DE ESTADOS UNIDOS CON AMERICA LATINA].  HE ADDED THAT THE UNITED
STATES HAS DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR THE DESIRE FOR FREEDOM OF TALL
BLOND EAST GERMANS AND OF SHORT DARK PANAMANIANS."

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 DEC 89 (LA PRENSA GRAFICA) -- [TEXT] FATHER JOSE MARIA
TOJEIRA S.J. [SOCIETY OF JESUS], THE JESUIT PROVINCIAL SPOKESMAN FOR
CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS RELEASED A NOTE DENYING INEXACT REPORTS ON THE CASE OF
THE MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS.  HE SAID THAT THEY NOT WERE MARXIST GUERRILLA
SYMPATHIZERS.

   THE NOTE READS AS FOLLOWS:

   23 DECEMBER 1989

   PROV. 264/89

   DIRECTOR DUTRIZ

   DIRECTOR OF LA PRENSA GRAFICA

   SAN SALVADOR

   DEAR MR.DIRECTOR:

   THE NEWSPAPER WHICH YOU DIRECT, ON 21 DECEMBER 1989, PUBLISHED ON
PAGES 6 AND 7 TWO ARTICLES ON THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS THAT WERE
MURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER.  THESE ARTICLES ARE WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THEY DISTORT THE REALITY OF THE CASE OR THEY INCORRECTLY DESCRIBE
THE ACTIVITY OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS.

   ON PAGE 6 AN ARTICLE ENTITLED "FRATRICIDAL STRUGGLE," WHICH IS
SIGNED BY MR. LUIS PAZOS, SAYS THAT "THE PRIESTS WERE MARXIST
GUERRILLA SYMPATHIZERS" AND THAT THE UNIVERSITY IN WHICH THEY WORK "IS
KNOWN IN EL SALVADOR AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS."

   THE ARTICLE SPEAKS OF "THESE PRIESTS' NEOMARXIST-PHILOSOPHICAL
POSITION WHICH IS CONTRARY TO CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE."

   I WISH TO STATE THAT:

   1. THE MURDERED PRIESTS WERE NOT SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MARXIST
GUERRILLAS.  THEY ONLY TRIED TO TALK WITH THE DIFFERENT SECTORS IN
CONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR, SEEKING TO MEDIATE IN AN EFFORT TO FIND PEACE
WITH JUSTICE.

   2. PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR CONSIDER THE UCA [CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS,
BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THE UCA COURAGEOUSLY
FOLLOWS THE CHURCH'S SOCIAL DOCTRINE.  THIS STATEMENT, IF MADE WITHOUT
THE RESERVATION THAT IT ONLY REPRESENTS THE VIEWS OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE
AND THE FACT THAT THE ARTICLE FORGETS TO MENTION THE MANY OTHERS DO
NOT BELIEVE, IS IN OUR OPINION A MANIPULATION OF THE TRUTH.

   3. THE POSITION OF THE PRIESTS WAS NOT "NEOMARXIST" IN THE
PHILOSOPHICAL FIELD.  FATHER ELLACURIA CAME FROM THE SCHOOL OF THE
SPANISH PHILOSOPHER ZUBIRI, WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE DEEPLY ROOTED IN
CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY.  FATHER AMANDO LOPEZ WROTE HIS DOCTORAL THESIS
ON THE SPANISH PHILOSOPHER AND PRIEST AMOR RUIBAL.  THE "ZUBIRIAN"
INCLINATION OF FATHER ELLACURIA WAS INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN IN MOST
PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOLS.  THOSE WHO ACCUSE THE MURDERED PRIESTS OF
HAVING NEOMARXIST PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS ARE PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGING
THEIR IGNORANCE.

   4. STATEMENTS SUCH AS THESE, WHICH WERE REPEATED IN OTHER MEDIA
BEFORE THE MURDER OF THE PRIESTS, PARTLY PROMOTED THEIR MURDER.  WE
THEREFORE CONSIDER THEIR REPETITION TO BE A VERY SERIOUS MATTER.

   ON PAGE 7, AND IN AN EDITORIAL ARTICLE, THE NEWSPAPER MENTIONS THE
NEED TO AVOID "THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY PRIVATE PSEUDO-INVESTIGATIONS,
WHEREVER THEY MIGHT COME FROM."  ON THIS STATEMENT I WANT TO SIMPLY
ADD THAT IN A CASE LIKE THIS THE INJURED PARTY HAS EVERY RIGHT, BOTH
IN EL SALVADOR AND IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD, TO CONDUCT ITS OWN
PRIVATE INVESTIGATION.  FURTHERMORE, UNLESS PUBLICLY AND IRREFUTABLY
PROVEN HARMFUL, NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONDEMN IT "IN ADVANCE" SAYING
THAT IT IS PLAYING DETECTIVES.

   I BEG OF YOU MR. DIRECTOR, BASED ON THE RIGHT TO REPLY AND THE
JUSTICE THAT THE MURDERED JESUITS AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEM
DESERVE, THAT YOU PUBLISH THIS CLARIFICATIONS IN YOUR NEWSPAPER WITH
THE SAME DESIRE TO REACH YOUR READERS AS THOSE WHO WROTE THE ARTICLES.

   YOURS TRULY.

   FATHER JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA

   SOCIETY OF JESUS PROVINCIAL."

   TEGUCIGALPA, 31 DEC 89 (TELEVISORA HONDURENA) -- [SPEECH] [HONDURAN
PRESIDENT JOSE SIMEON AZCONA HOYO] [EXCERPTS] COUNTRYMEN: NOW THAT THE
NEW YEAR IS JUST MOMENTS AWAY, WE APPEAR BEFORE THE NATION, AS WE HAVE
DONE IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, TO EXPRESS OUR MOST
SINCERE WISHES FOR THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF ALL HONDURAN PEOPLE. OUR
GREATEST WISH IS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL IN THE NATION, WITHOUT EXCEPTION,
TO ENJOY WELL- BEING AND PEACE AT HOME. WE CAN AFFIRM THAT DURING OUR
TENURE WE HAVE CONSTANTLY STRIVEN TOWARD THE HIGHER GOALS OF
COLLECTIVE PROGRESS AND WELL-BEING IN THE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS WE HAVE
FACED DURING THESE 4 YEARS OF GOVERNMENT -- SITUATIONS THAT ARE
NATURAL TO A DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE OURS.

   ON 25 JANUARY 1990 WE WILL PRESENT TO CONGRESS A REPORT SUMMING UP
THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE DURING OUR ADMINISTRATION. THUS, ALL THE PEOPLE
WILL BE TRUTHFULLY INFORMED OF OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND OF THE PROJECTS
THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN SO THAT THE HONDURAN PEOPLE CAN DEVELOP
MATERIAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HISTORICAL
EVOLUTION TO WHICH WE ASPIRE, BOTH AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A STATE.
[PASSAGE OMITTED]

   WE HAVE EXPRESSED OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE AT SIX CENTRAL AMERICAN
SUMMITS, WHERE WE DEFENDED THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES AND CONDEMNED ANY
FORM OF TOTALITARIANISM AS WELL AS THE TERRORIST ACTIONS THAT HAVE
CAUSED MANY DEATHS AND BROUGHT SORROW TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE.

   I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT THE TELA SUMMIT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE
SEARCH FOR PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN CENTRAL AMERICA, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE
COUNTRIES PLAGUED BY VIOLENCE.

   WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT GREAT SACRIFICES ARE NECESSARY IF WE
ARE TO MAKE SOCIAL PROGRESS, AND WE HAVE CONSTANTLY WORKED TO
ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR THE COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT.

   OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE LASTING AND HAVE GIVEN THE COUNTRY BETTER
PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE.  THAT HAS BEEN OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE.  WE DID
NOT RESORT TO DEMAGOGUERY, AND WE SPOKE THE TRUTH -- DURING THE
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN AND LATER AS THE LEADER OF THE NATION'S DESTINY --
SO AS NOT TO CREATE FALSE EXPECTATIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE.  [PASSAGE
OMITTED]

   I WANT TO REASSERT THAT ONCE I STEP DOWN FROM THE PRESIDENCY, I
WILL CONTINUE FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO STRIVE FOR THE UNITY OF THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE SO THAT WITH EFFORT AND WORK WE MAY IMPROVE OUR LIVING
STANDARDS.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   FINALLY I WANT TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE DESIRE FOR SUCCESS -- FOR THE
WELL-BEING OF THE FATHERLAND -- TO RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS ROMERO,
WHO WILL TAKE OFFICE AS PRESIDENT ON 27 JANUARY L990.  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 2 JAN 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[PRESS AND INFORMATION DIRECTORATE OF THE PRESIDENCY] [TEXT] THE PRESS
AND INFORMATION DIRECTORATE OF THE PRESIDENCY ANNOUNCES TO THE
NICARAGUAN PEOPLE AND TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT ACCORDING TO
PRELIMINARY REPORTS, ON 1 JANUARY AT 1930, A GROUP OF
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY MERCENARIES, FINANCED BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT,
AMBUSHED MEMBERS OF A RELIGIOUS GROUP HEADED BY MSGR PABLO SMITH,
BISHOP OF THE BLUEFIELDS APOSTOLIC VICARIATE, IN A PLACE KNOWN AS OJO
DE AGUA, LOCATED BETWEEN ARANCHAMBA AND COPERNA, NORTHERN ATLANTIC
REGION, RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF NUNS MAUREEN CONNALY, AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN, AND TERESA ROSALES MISQUITA.  BISHOP PABLO SMITH AND
FRANCISCA COLOMER MISQUITA WERE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED.  THIS IS PART OF
THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT, WHICH INVADED
PANAMA AND CONDUCTED A MILITARY INCURSION INTO THE HOME OF THE
NICARAGUAN AMBASSADOR IN THAT COUNTRY.

   THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS THESE SERIOUS INCIDENTS, WHICH
ENDANGER THE PEACE EFFORTS CONDUCTED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS AND SUPPORTED BY THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.  NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA SAAVEDRA CALLS ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
AND ON THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO CONDEMN THIS
BRUTAL CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST RELIGIOUS PEOPLE.  THIS ACTION IS
SIMILAR TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS PERPETRATED IN
SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER 1989 BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH JUST AS
THE COUNTERREVOLUTION AND THE OTHER RIGHTIST NICARAGUAN FORCES,
DEFENDS THE AGGRESSIVE POLICIES OF THE UNITED STATES.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 4 JAN 90 (RADIO REBELDE NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] THE BLOW DEALT TO THE LATIN AMERICAN CONSCIENCE BY THE U.S.
INTERVENTION IN PANAMA IS ABOUT TO DEFLATE THE OPTIMISTIC HOPES FOR A
JOINT STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DRUG TRADE.  EVEN GEORGE BUSH'S 15 FEBRUARY
MEETING IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, COLOMBIA, WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF
BOLIVIA, PERU, AND COLOMBIA -- THE LEADING PRODUCERS OF COCA LEAVES --
IS IN JEOPARDY.  PERUVIAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE ALAN GARCIA MADE IT KNOWN
THAT HE WILL NOT ATTEND THE MEETING IN PROTEST OF THE PANAMA INVASION.
BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA IS BEING QUESTIONED BY THE
BOLIVIAN SUPREME COURT OVER THE EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED STATES OF
FORMER COLONEL LUIS ARCE GOMEZ.  THE COURT REGARDS PAZ ZAMORA'S
DECISION ON THIS MATTER AS UNDUE EXERCISE OF JURISDICTIONAL POWERS AND
AN ATTACK ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  BOLIVIAN CHIEF JUSTICE EDGAR
OBLITAS CHARGED THAT THE EXTRADITION OF ARCE GOMEZ, WHO WAS A
NOTORIOUS DRUG TRAFFICKER, AN EXECUTIONER AND A PLOTTER, HAS PREVENTED
THE AUTHORITIES FROM CLEARING UP SEVERAL RECENT EVENTS IN BOLIVIAN
HISTORY, WHICH THUS REMAIN JUST PARTIALLY KNOWN.

   FOR ITS PART, COLOMBIA REACTED WITH SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION TO
REPORTS THAT THE UNITED STATES PLANS TO ESTABLISH AIRSPACE AND NAVAL
PATROLS WITHIN COLOMBIAN JURISDICTION WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH BOGOTA.
THE WHITE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON STATED LATER THAT THE PATROLS WILL TAKE
PLACE OVER INTERNATIONAL WATERS AND THAT THEY WILL ENTAIL CONCERTED
ACTIONS.  IT IS KNOWN, HOWEVER, THAT AN EVENTUAL BLOCKADE OF THE
COLOMBIAN COAST IS PART OF A PACKAGE OF SPECIAL MEASURES COORDINATED
BY U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY DICK CHENEY.

   THE COLOMBIAN POLICE, WHO HAVE BEEN CREDITED WITH SEIZING 80
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL AMOUNT OF COCAINE SEIZED WORLDWIDE, HAVE
IN RECENT WEEKS DEALT SEVERE BLOWS TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DRUG LORDS.
THE PUNITIVE U.S. ACTION WOULD IN PRACTICE ENTAIL THAT THE UNITED
STATES DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THESE ACHIEVEMENTS AND WOULD CREATE AN
EMBARRASSING SITUATION FOR PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IN A YEAR WHEN
COLOMBIANS WILL ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, MAYORS,
DEPARTMENTAL DEPUTIES, AND COUNCILMEN.

   THE CLAIM THAT THE ACTION IS INTENDED TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PREVENT
THE DRUG TRADE IS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT IT WILL
NOT BE MATCHED BY EQUIVALENT STIFF MEASURES IN THE COUNTRY HOLDING THE
WORLD RECORD IN DRUG CONSUMPTION AND THAT U.S. TROOPS ARE CURRENTLY
OCCUPYING COLOMBIA'S NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, PANAMA.

   WHERE DOES THE U.S. DESIRE TO CHASE CRIMINALS END AND WHERE DOES
ITS IMPERIALIST DESIRE TO LIMIT LATIN AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY AND TO
DECIDE THE FATE OF OUR PEOPLES START?  THE PANAMANIAN CASE IS AN
EXAMPLE.  IT IS NOT NOT ONLY LEGITIMATE BUT NECESSARY FOR US TO BE
DISTRUSTFUL.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE VIOLENT
AND SURPRISING EVENTS IN VENEZUELA AND ARGENTINA EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WHICH
RESULTED IN THOUSANDS KILLED, ARE AN INDICATION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN
COMING YEARS.  WITH ITS INTERVENTIONIST POLICY, THE UNITED STATES HAS
NEGATED OUR PEOPLES' SELF - DETERMINATION AND EMBITTERED THE RELATIONS
BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES IN THE AREA.  BY PREVENTING THE SOCIAL FORCES FROM
ACTING FREELY, THE UNITED STATES PROLONGS THE WAR AND ELIMINATES THE
POSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING TRUE DEMOCRATIZATION.  THE U.S. IMPERIALIST POLICY
HAS WEAKENED IN THE DECADE ENDING TODAY.  LATIN AMERICANISM HAS ADVANCED AND
THE TIME OF A DOCILE AND PUPPET CONTINENT HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

   LATIN AMERICAN INTERESTS AND SOCIAL FORCES HAVE MATURED.  DESPITE
30 YEARS OF INVASION AND COMMERCIAL FREEZING, CUBA IS STILL UNBEATEN.
NICARAGUA HAS RESISTED, HAS DEFEATED 10 YEARS OF WAR WAGED BY
MERCENARIES, AND IS PREPARING TO LEGITIMIZE ITS REVOLUTION.  IN EL
SALVADOR, THE 10 YEARS OF COUNTERINSURGENCY WITH WHICH THE UNITED
STATES HAS TRIED TO DEFEAT US AND WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS TRIED TO
IMPOSE ON US HAVE FAILED.  THE INSURGENCY PROBLEMS THAT WERE
PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED WITH A FEW ADVISERS AND IN A COUPLE OF YEARS
REMAIN UNSETTLED IN EL SALVADOR DESPITE A $3 BILLION AID PACKAGE,
NEARLY 1,000 ADVISERS, AND 10 YEARS OF BLOODY WAR.  IN THE PAST THE
PROBLEM OF PANAMA WOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED WITH A COUP IN A FEW HOURS'
TIME, BUT NOW 2 YEARS OF ECONOMIC FREEZING, SUBVERSION, BUSINESSMEN'S
STRIKES, ATTACKS, AND THWARTED COUPS WERE NECESSARY.  FINALLY, THE
UNITED STATES HAD TO USE 30,000 MEN, DESTROY A COUNTRY, AND FIGHT FOR
1 WEEK TO BRING TO SUBMISSION AN ARMY AND A MILITARY HEAD THEY
THEMSELVES HAD TRAINED.

   LATIN AMERICANISM IS ON ITS WAY FORWARD.  THE DECADE NOW BEGINNING
BELONGS TO LATIN AMERICA.  THE STRUGGLE IN OUR CONTINENT IS OF AN
ANTI-IMPERIALIST NATURE.  OUR STRUGGLE, AS EVERYONE KNOWS, STARTED IN
CENTRAL AMERICA 10 YEARS AGO WITH THE TRIUMPH OF THE SANDINIST
REVOLUTION AND THE BEGINNING OF WAR IN OUR COUNTRY.  THIS HAS TURNED
THE REGION INTO A TRUE VIETNAM DURING THIS DECADE.  BECAUSE OF ALL
THIS, THE SACRIFICE THAT OUR STRUGGLE ENTAILS IS GREAT AND THE PROCESS
IS COMPLEX, BECAUSE BOTH THE STRUGGLE AND THE PROCESS OCCUR IN A
CHANGING WORLD SITUATION.  WHILE IN EASTERN EUROPE THE AREAS OF
INFLUENCE ARE DISAPPEARING AND THE PEOPLES' SELF - DETERMINATION IS
OPENING TO AN UNHINDERED PATH, THE U.S. EMPIRE WALKS IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION AND CLINGS TO ITS NEOCOLONIAL DOMINATION OF LATIN AMERICA
AND THE CARIBBEAN.  WHAT IS AT STAKE IN EL SALVADOR IS NOT PRECISELY
COMMUNISM OR CAPITALISM, BUT DEMOCRACY AND THE CONTINENT'S
INDEPENDENCE.  LATIN AMERICA ASPIRES, NOT TO A RESTRICTED SOCIETY, BUT
TO A SELF-SUFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNAL SOCIAL BALANCE WITH THE
PARTICIPATION OF MANY SOCIAL SECTORS.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SOCIETIES
APPEAR TO BE POLARIZED IN THE EYES OF BOTH EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS, BUT
THE NEED FOR INDEPENDENCE WILL COALESCE ALL OF THESE FORCES.  IN THIS
CONTEXT, OUR STRUGGLE, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY FOR SELF - DETERMINATION
AND DEMOCRACY, IS IN THE CAPITALIST WORLD THE SPEARHEAD OF THE
STRUGGLE OF ALL LATIN AMERICAN AND THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES, WHICH DEMAND
THESE TRANSFORMATIONS.  ALL THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE DONE THESE YEARS AND
ALL THAT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED BY OUR COMBATANTS, MILITARY COMMANDERS,
POLITICAL LEADERS, AND THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED EITHER AS DIPLOMATS OR

THE RESHUFFLING OF PLANS, THE HEROIC RESISTANCE OF THE MASSES, THE

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A LOCAL RADIO STATION
REPORTED TODAY THAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE
SALVADORAN ARMY, WERE ARRESTED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS BECAUSE OF THEIR
SUSPECTED INVOLVEMENT IN THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX SPANISH JESUITS ON
16 NOVEMBER.

   CITING RELIABLE SOURCES, RADIO CADENA YSKL STATED THIS AFTERNOON
THAT THE SUSPECTED ASSASSINS WERE ARRESTED AFTER THE INVESTIGATIONS OF
THE CASE HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT.  U.S., SPANISH, AND BRITISH
INVESTIGATORS PARTICIPATED IN THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   IT HAS ALSO BEEN LEARNED THAT PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WILL
ADDRESS THE COUNTRY TONIGHT OVER A NATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION
NETWORK, PRESUMABLY TO REFER TO THIS SUBJECT.


DEV-MUC3-1040 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE
EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE SALVADOAN ARMED FORCES' GENERAL
STAFF, HAS ADMITTED THAT 2 OFFICERS AND 45 SOLDIERS OF AN
ELITE BATTALION ARE "BEING HELD IN VARIOUS GUARRISONS OF
SAN SALVADOR" WHILE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE KILLING OF THE             
SIX JESUITS CONTINUE.

   ACCORDING TO PONCE, THESE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE ATLACATL BATTALION
WERE PLACED AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE CRIMES INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION, WHICH
IS STUDYING THE CASE OF THE JESUITS WHO WERE SHOT TO DEATH ON 16 NOVEMBER.  

   SPANISH, BRITISH, FRENCH, AND CANADIAN POLICE AGENTS HAVE
PARTICIPATED IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

   THESE SALVADORAN SOLDIERS HAD SEARCHED THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE 2
DAYS BEFORE THE KILLING, PONCE TOLD THE MEDIA TODAY WITHOUT GIVING
MUCH DETAIL.

   HOWEVER, DIPLOMATIC SOURCES STATED THAT THE SOLDIERS WILL BE
"CONFINED" TO THEIR RESPECTIVE GARRISONS AND ADDED THAT THEY INCLUDE
"FIVE OFFICERS."

   FRANCISCO ESTRADA, A SALVADORAN PRIEST WHO WAS APPOINTED NEW RECTOR
OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UCA), SAID THAT "THE PRESIDENT'S
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES COMMITTED THIS CRIME, IS
AN IMPORTANT STEP VERY SELDOM TAKEN IN THIS COUNTRY."  HOWEVER, THIS
"MATTER IS NOT OVER WITH YET."

   "WHAT WOULD REALLY BE NEW IS FOR HIM TO SAY WHO DID IT, INSTEAD OF
JUST SAYING THAT IT WAS THE ARMED FORCES," THE PRIEST TOLD ACAN-EFE
AND ADDED THAT HE TRUSTS IN THE "GOODWILL AND ETHICS" OF PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   EVERY SOURCE CONSULTED WITH BY ACAN-EFE, WHETHER DIPLOMATIC OR
RELIGIOUS, AGREED TO SAY THAT NOW IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CRISTIANI TO
TAKE ONE STEP FURTHER AND MENTION THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN
THIS MURDER CARRIED OUT AT UCA.

   TWO DOMESTIC SERVANTS (A MOTHER AND A DAUGHTER) WERE KILLED
TOGETHER WITH THE CLERGYMEN, FIVE SPANIARDS, INCLUDING UCA RECTOR
IGNACIO ELLACURIA, AND A SALVADORAN.

   THE U.S.  EMBASSY IN EL SALVADOR ALSO CONGRATULATED CRISTIANI TODAY FOR
HIS EFFORTS TO CLARIFY THE ASSASSINATION, AS U.S.  CONGRESSMEN AND OFFICIALS
OF THE [GEORGE] BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD ASKED OF HIM.

   IN FACT, DIPLOMATIC SOURCES COMMENTED TO ACAN-EFE THAT BEGINNING ON 22
JANUARY, THE U.S.  CONGRESS IS TO DISCUSS A NEW $90 MILLION PACKAGE OF
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR THAT MIGHT HINGE ON THE STATUS OF
THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   THE UNITED STATES HAS GIVEN OVER $3 BILLION IN MILITARY AND
ECONOMIC AID TO EL SALVADOR OVER THE PAST DECADE, AND AT PRESENT IT IS
GIVING ABOUT $1.4 MILLION DAILY, ACCORDING TO SALVADORAN POLITICAL
SOURCES.

   UCA RECTOR FRANCISCO ESTRADA SAID THAT CRISTIANI COULD TAKE THIS
STEP BECAUSE "HE IS CONFIDENT THAT HE CAN CONTROL ANY INTERNAL
RESENTMENT WITHIN HIS GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES."

   A SIMILAR OPINION WAS EXPRESSED BY A EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT, WHO TOLD
ACAN-EFE THAT CRISTIANI IS TAKING A GREAT RISK BY ACCUSING MEMBERS OF
THE ARMED FORCES OF THIS CRIME.  HE ADDED: " IF HE HAS DONE THIS, IT
IS BECAUSE HE FEELS VERY SELF-CONFIDENT."

   OBSERVERS COMPARE THE INVESTIGATION BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE
PRESENT RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT WITH ONE CARRIED OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF
JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, A CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT, INTO THE 1980 MURDER OF
SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.

   DUARTE, WHO TURNED OVER POWER TO CRISTIANI ON 1 JUNE 1989, ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS ATTRIBUTED THE MURDER OF ARCHBISHOP ROMERO TO ROBERTO D'
AUBUISSON, A PRESENT DEPUTY AND LEADER OF THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE, BUT THE INVESTIGATIONS NEVER LED TO ANY CONCRETE RESULTS.

   MADRID (SPAIN), 8 JAN 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] HERE IN MADRID, THE
LEFT-WING LEADER OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION, RUBEN ZAMORA, HAD A MEETING
JUST A FEW MINUTES' AGO WITH FOREIGN MINISTER FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ ORDONEZ,
BEFORE STARTING A EUROPEAN TOUR SEEKING AID TO OVERCOME THE CRISIS FACING THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.  GLORIA DEL CAMPO REPORTS FROM THE FOREIGN
MINISTRY, SANTA CRUZ PALACE:

   [DEL CAMPO] RUBEN ZAMORA BELIEVES THAT IF, AS IT HAS BEEN
ANNOUNCED, OFFICIALS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY ARE TO BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL
FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO EMPLOYEES OF THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS BEEN DONE
AND THAT, TO A LARGE EXTENT, THIS IS DUE TO THE PRESSURE OF COUNTRIES
LIKE SPAIN, THE EEC, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.  BUT, SPEAKING TO RNE,
RUBEN ZAMORA EXPRESSED HIS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE REAL IDENTITY AND
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE MASSACRE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ZAMORA] PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS STILL NOT GIVEN
ANY NAMES AND SO WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S ALL BASED ON
RUMORS.  THEREFORE, THE FIRST THING TO BE SEEN IS WHO IS INVOLVED AND,
SECONDLY, WHETHER THEY ARE REALLY BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND, THIRDLY,
WHETHER THEY REALLY ARE SENTENCED FOR THE CRIME WHICH THEY HAVE
COMMITTED.  SO, THERE ARE STILL MANY OBSTACLES IN THE WAY BEFORE
GIVING A FINAL OPINION ON THE MATTER.  [END RECORDING]

   [DEL CAMPO] RUBEN ZAMORA HAD A 45-MINUTE MEETING WITH SPANISH
FOREIGN MINISTER FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ ORDONEZ AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.
HE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR AND URGENCY OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL
SALVADOR, OF AIDING -- THROUGH THE MEDIATION OF THE UN SECRETARY
GENERAL -- NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS.  HE EXPLAINED THE SITUATION OF
THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN EL SALVADOR AND THE NEED FOR THE POLITICAL

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 12 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SOME 150
PEOPLE THREW STONES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY TODAY TO
PROTEST THE PRESENCE AT THE EMBASSY OF 12 REFUGEES CLOSELY LINKED TO
FORMER GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA.

   RESIDENTS OF A NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD GATHERED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY
SHOUTING SLOGANS AGAINST THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN REFUGEES, WHOM THEY
SHOUTED SHOULD BE "SHOT," AND AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT FOR
GRANTING THEM ASYLUM.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS, WHO BROKE THE WINDSHIELDS OF SOME VEHICLES
PASSING IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY, WERE FORCED AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF
THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE AND U.S.
SOLDIERS.

   THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY ARE
MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, SPOKESMEN OF THE FORMER DEFENSE FORCES;
MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, CHIEF OF THE ELITE "MACHO DE MONTE" COMPANY;
NORIEGA'S FORMER SECRETARY, MARCELA TASON; CAPTAIN NARCISA CASTILLERO;
MAJOR HERACLIDES SUCRE; AND SEVEN RELATIVES OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED
PEOPLE.

      SUCRE WAS CHARGED TODAY BY PANAMANIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROGELIO
CRUZ WITH BEING INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI,
WHO PROMOTED A FOILED COUP AGAINST NORIEGA ON 3 OCTOBER 1989.

   PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TODAY EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO
PROTECT "AS LONG AS NECESSARY" THE FORMER NORIEGA AIDES WHO SOUGHT
SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA.

   PERU ANNOUNCED ON 9 JANUARY THAT IT HAS GRANTED ASYLUM TO FIVE
PANAMANIAN MILITARY AND SEVEN OF THEIR RELATIVES.  THE PANAMANIAN
GOVERNMENT SAID ON 12 JANUARY THAT IT WILL NOT GRANT SAFE-CONDUCT FOR
THESE PEOPLE, WHOM IT CONSIDERS "COMMON CRIMINALS," TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.

   THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ON 11 JANUARY SAID THE PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE
IS IN CHARGE OF GUARDING THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND POINTED OUT THAT THE
SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS POSED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE REFUGEES SHOULD BE
HANDLED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF PANAMA AND PERU.

   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PANAMANIAN
PRESIDENT GUILLERMO ENDARA IS "UNLAWFUL."  HE ADDED THAT PANAMA IS
BEING RULED BY "THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE PENTAGON, THE SOUTHERN
COMMAND, AND THE U.S.  TROOPS."

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] A MILITARY SOURCE,
QUOTING INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, SAID TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS HAVE ABANDONED THEIR STRICTLY MILITARY GOALS TO INSTEAD
DIRECT THEIR ACTIONS AGAINST ECONOMIC TARGETS, WITHIN THEIR USUAL
PATTERN OF WEARING DOWN THE ECONOMY.

   THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE CHANGE IN TACTICS TO THE "FAILURE" OF THE
OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) ON 11 NOVEMBER, IN WHICH SIX GUERRILLA COMMANDERS AND ALL
GUERRILLA TROOPS TOOK PART.

   ACCORDING TO THE FMLN, THE OFFENSIVE'S GOAL WAS TO NEGOTIATE WITH
THE GOVERNMENT ON A "ONE-TO-ONE" BASIS.  IN THE OPINION OF THE ARMY,
HOWEVER, THE FMLN WAS TRYING TO CAUSE AN INSURRECTION AMONG THE PEOPLE
TO GRAB POWER.

   THE SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT FOLLOWING
THE OFFENSIVE, THE FMLN DECIDED TO "READAPT" THEIR MILITARY CADRES TO
THE TRADITIONAL "PROLONGED PEOPLE'S WAR."

   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE BELIEVES THAT WITH THIS CHANGE IN TACTICS,
THE GUERRILLAS ARE TRYING TO "MAINTAIN THEIR MILITARY PRESENCE AND
THUS RAISE THE FIGHTERS MORALE FOLLOWING THE DISBANDING OF IMPORTANT
MILITARY CADRES."

   FOLLOWING THE SUSPENSION OF THE UNILATERAL TRUCE DECREED BY THE
FMLN BETWEEN 23 DECEMBER AND 2 JANUARY, THE GUERRILLAS RESTARTED THEIR
ACTIONS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY BY BLOWING-UP THE COUNTRY'S
POWER GRID AND SHOPS IN SAN SALVADOR.

   ECONOMIC LOSSES LAST YEAR DUE TO GUERRILLA SABOTAGE TO THE
TRANSPORT, POWER AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS, AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURES
SURPASSED $100 MILLION, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES.

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT THE MILITARY RESTRUCTURE ENCOMPASSED THE SIX
ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMPRISE THE FMLN: THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY OF
CENTRAL AMERICAN WORKERS (PRTC), THE NATIONAL RESISTANCE (RN), THE
SALVADORAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCS), THE POPULAR LIBERATION FORCES (FPL),
THE ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION (FAL), AND THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY
ARMY (ERP).

   ACCORDING TO MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, THE PRTC, RN, AND THE PCS NOW
OPERATE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER IMPORTANT CITIES OF THE COUNTRY,
WHILE THE FPL OPERATES IN THE CENTRAL REGION, THE ERP IN THE
NORTHEAST, AND THE FAL IN THE SOUTHEAST.

ALVAREZ CEDENO] [TEXT] SOME 150 PERSONS PICKETED AND THREW STONES AT
THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY ON 12 JANUARY.  THE DEMONSTRATORS DEMANDED THAT
FORMER PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES [FDP] MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, AND
OTHERS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE FORMER MILITARY REGIME WHO SOUGHT REFUGE
AT THE EMBASSY, BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE MISSION.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS SHOUTED SLOGANS AGAINST NORIEGA AND THREW SOME
STONES.  THEY BROKE THE REAR WINDSHIELDS OF TWO DIPLOMATIC VEHICLES
PARKED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY: A WHITE MITSUBISHI, LICENSE PLATES
CD-325, AND A RED MITSUBISHI, LICENSE PLATES CD-142.

   "GRIMALDO...COWARD KILLER, COME OUT AND SHOW YOUR FACE," THE CROWD
SHOUTED WHILE THE U.S. SOLDIERS GUARDING THE MISSION GENTLY MOVED THEM
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET.  SOME EIGHT
MEMBERS OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE, ALSO GUARDING THE EMBASSY,
DID NOT INTERVENE.

   DESPITE THE SHOUTS DEMANDING "JUSTICE AND PRISON" FOR NORIEGA'S
FOLLOWERS, NO ONE CAME OUT OF THE EMBASSY LOCATED ON "F" STREET, EL
CANGREJO, A MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD IN PANAMA CITY.

   MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, COMMANDER OF THE ELITE "MACHO DE MONTE"
COMPANY THAT FOILED THE 3 OCTOBER COUP AGAINST NORIEGA; HERACLIDES
SUCRE, WHO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE TWO OFFICERS WHO "SHOT"
MOISES GIROLDI; AND MARCELA TASON, NORIEGA'S PERSONAL SECRETARY ARE
ALSO AT THE EMBASSY WITH LOPEZ GRIMALDO, WHO WAS THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE
DISMANTLED FDP.

   APPROXIMATELY 40 U.S. SOLDIERS, SUPPORTED BY AN ARMORED PERSONNEL
CARRIER AND THREE "HUMMER" ARMORED VEHICLES, ARE GUARDING THE PERUVIAN
EMBASSY.

   AT THE TIME OF THE DEMOSTRATIONS, RESIDENTS IN NEARBY BUILDINGS
WAVED WHITE HANDERCHIEFS AND BANGED POTS AND PANS, AND EMPTY CANS.  A
SIMILAR SITUATION WAS OCCURRING ON THE STREET.

   ONE OF THE DEMONSTRATORS TOLD LA PRENSA: "WE WILL STAY HERE UNTIL
THEY COME OUT BECAUSE THEY MUST PAY FOR THEIR CRIMES; WE WILL COME
BACK HERE EVERY AFTERNOON."

   THE U.S. SOLDIERS CORDONED OFF THE AREA WITH CONCERTINA WIRE WHILE
A GROUP OF PEOPLE "BOOED" THEM FOR DOING THIS.

MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS SAID ON 12 JANUARY THAT AS LONG AS THE
GUERRILLA GROUPS CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE EFFORTS WITH
MILITARY ACTIONS, THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE WILL ALSO HAVE TO RESPOND
MILITARILY.  MINISTER LEMOS WAS REFERRING TO THE CURRENT ATTACKS WHICH HAVE
BEEN LAUNCHED BY SEVERAL REBEL GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  MINISTER
LEMOS SAID THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS WORRIED ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S PUBLIC
ORDER, AND ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO USE THE ARMY AND THE
POLICE TO FIGHT VIOLENCE.

   LIKEWISE, LEMOS SIMMONDS DESCRIBED THE GUERRILLA GROUPS STILL
LAUNCHING ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS ANACHRONIC AND OUT-DATED.
HE SAID THAT WE HOPE THIS SITUATION WILL CHANGE SOON, AND STRESSED
THAT SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EASTERN EUROPE, WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND
WHY MANY OF THE REBEL GROUPS ARE BENT ON IMPOSING A SYSTEM THAT THEY
CONSIDER IDEAL WHEN IT IS BEING REJECTED AND REPUDIATED BY SO MANY
STATES THAT IMPOSED IT.  MINISTER LEMOS SAID THAT THE THE GUERRILLA
ACTION SHOULD BE UP-DATED; THE REBELS SHOULD STOP AND CONSIDER WHETHER
THE STRUGGLE THEY ARE WAGING IS WORTH IT SINCE THE SYSTEM THEY ARE
DEFENDING IS SOMETHING OF THE PAST.

   MINISTER LEMOS ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS THAT IS
ROCKING THE COUNTRY.  HE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND DEFENSE
MINISTRIES ARE TAKING SPECIAL MEASURES TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION.  HE
SAID THAT WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF KIDNAPPING AS A
POLITICAL WEAPON AND ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL DEAL WITH ALL
THOSE INVOLVED IN KIDNAPPINGS AS COMMON CRIMINALS.  THE MINISTER ALSO
ASKED THE PEOPLE TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUTHORITIES IN LOCATING THOSE
AREAS WHERE THE BANDS OF CRIMINALS ARE OPERATING.

   THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER ALSO TALKED ABOUT A DIALOGUE WITH THE
REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA, FARC, AND SAID THAT TALKING
ABOUT A DIALOGUE IS USELESS IF THEY CONTINUE THEIR SUBVERSIVE
ACTIVITIES.

   NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), NO DATE -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] NOW THAT THE INVESTIGATION HAS ADVANCED
TO A SIGNIFICANT POINT, I BELIEVE THE TIME IS RIGHT TO SAY THAT THE
RESULTS OBTAINED THUS FAR RESPOND TO THE WIDESPREAD OUTCRY OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE - - IN THE SENSE THAT THOSE CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL
ACTIONS STAND TRIAL SO CRIMINALS ARE NOT LEFT UNPUNISHED.  THIS IS THE
COMMITMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE ARMED FORCES.
HOWEVER, IT IS WISE TO CLARIFY THAT, IN THE SAME MANNER THAT PEOPLE
HAVE MADE DEMANDS AND CONDEMNED THE CASE AT ISSUE TODAY, ACTIONS
RESULTING FROM THE WAVE OF FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] TERRORIST VIOLENCE SHOULD ALSO BE CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED WITH
THE SAME VEHEMENCE.

   IN THE SAME MANNER, AGAIN WE WANT TO URGE ALL SALVADORANS TO
ABSTAIN FROM SPECULATING OVER THESE REGRETTABLE INCIDENTS, BECAUSE
THAT WILL ONLY HINDER THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.  IT IS NECESSARY THAT LAW
AND JUSTICE PREVAIL IN OUR COUNTRY, SO THAT NO ONE TRAMPLES ON THEM.

   IN REGARD TO THIS INVESTIGATION, WE WISH TO REAFFIRM THAT AN
OBJECTIVITY HAS PREVAILED AT ALL TIMES, AND THAT THE ACCUSED WILL BE
SENT TO THE PERTINENT COURT SO THAT THEY STAND TRIAL ACCORDING TO THE
MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND IN OTHER LAWS.

   IN CONCLUSION, WE WANT TO TELL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT, ALTHOUGH
IT IS TRUE THIS IS A REGRETTABLE INCIDENT, WE MUST ACCEPT IT AS AN
UNAVOIDABLE REALITY AND AS EVIDENCE TO THE WORLD THAT WE SALVADORANS
AND OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE A HIGH SENSE OF JUSTICE, MORALITY, AND
ETHICS.

   AS COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL ITS
MEMBERS FOR THEIR PROFESSIONALISM, DEDICATION, AND EXEMPLARY CONDUCT,
EVIDENCED NOT ONLY IN VIEW OF THIS INCIDENT, BUT ALSO BY HALTING -- IN
DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE -- THE FMLN TERRORIST AGGRESSION.  THAT
BRILLIANT HISTORIC EVENT WILL ALWAYS BE PRESENT IN THE HEARTS OF OUR
PEOPLE, WHO WILL RENDER HOMAGE TO THE ARMED FORCES FOR HAVING
PROTECTED THE FREEDOM OF OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

INVESTIGATION INTO THE MURDER OF SALVADORAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR
OQUELI COLINDRES IN GUATEMALA 2 DAYS AGO.

TRAFFICKERS WHO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND STOP THEIR TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES AND SMUGGLING OF DRUGS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT SAID IT WILL
NOT ENTER INTO DEALS WITH THEM THAT MAY VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION OR
THE LAWS.

   THE STATEMENT, WHICH WAS THE FIRST TO BE MADE BY AN OFFICIAL
SOURCE, WAS MADE BY GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS TO A TELEVISION
NEWSCAST.

   COMMENTING ON THE COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THE EXTRADITABLES OFFER TO
END THEIR ILLEGAL TRADE, RELEASE THE HOSTAGES THEY ARE HOLDING, AND
STOP THEIR ATTACKS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY
"RESPECT FOR OUR RIGHTS AND RETURN TO OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES,"
LEMOS SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTION AND LAWS GUARANTEE A DUE
PROCESS AND RIGHT TO DEFENSE, BUT OF COURSE THEY ALSO DEMAND THAT
THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAWS SUBMIT TO THEM SO THAT, THROUGH THE JUDGES
AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY INTERVENTION BY THE GOVERNMENT, THE DEGREE OF
RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH ONE OF THEM AND WHETHER THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR
PUNISHMENT CAN BE DETERMINED."

   HE ADDED: "THESE PERSONS, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WILL ENJOY FULL
LEGAL GUARANTEES, BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE
COMPROMISES OF ANY KIND, BECAUSE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE GOVERNMENT
CANNOT VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION."

   EXPLAINING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS WON THIS WAR ON THE BASIS OF
MAKING NO CONCESSIONS, LEMOS SAID: "I DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO CHANGE
OUR POLICY OF NOT NEGOTIATING WHEN OUR OWN ENEMIES HAVE SAID THAT THIS
POLICY HAS TRIUMPHED."

   IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE, WHICH WAS DELIVERED THROUGH TWO WOMEN WHO WERE
KIDNAPPED AND RELEASED IN MEDELLIN, SEAT OF THE CARTEL BY THE SAME
NAME, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS RECOGNIZED THE STATE'S VICTORY OVER THE
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION AND AT THE SAME TIME OFFERED TO ABIDE BY THE

THAT SANDIGA HAD BEEN GIVEN 72 HOURS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND
EXPLAINED THAT HIS EXPULSION WAS THE RESULT OF STATEMENTS BY PERUVIAN
AUTHORITIES WHO DENIED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT
HEADED BY GUILLERMO ENDARA.

   ENDARA TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE FOLLOWING THE INVASION OF PANAMA BY
U.S. TROOPS WHO TOPPLED GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S REGIME.

   CASTULOVICH DENIED TODAY THAT PANAMA PLANS TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC

THAT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT IN COLOMBIA SINCE 1888.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LEMOS SIMMONDS] I SIGNED THE DECREE THAT
REESTABLISHED ADMINISTRATIVE EXTRADITION PROCEDURES, AND I SIGNED IT
WITH COMPLETE AWARENESS.  I CANNOT SAY ANYTHING DIFFERENT NOW FROM
WHAT I SAID 4 OR 5 MONTHS AGO.  [END RECORDING]

   THE MINISTER SAID THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT NEGOTIATE WITH THE
DRUG-TRAFFICKERS, BUT ALSO WILL NOT ACT ARROGANTLY IN DEFEATING THEM.
HE ADDED THAT NEW MEASURES AIMED AT STOPPING KIDNAPPINGS IN THE
COUNTRY ARE BEING STUDIED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LEMOS SIMMONDS] OF COURSE NOT ALL THE KIDNAPPED
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RELEASED.  LET US HOPE THAT THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS AND
EXTRADITABLES' PROMISE -- THAT NO ONE WILL BE KIDNAPPED AGAIN -- IS
KEPT.  THE TRUTH IS I CANNOT SAY THAT THERE WILL BE NO MORE

AND TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE. THE GROUP SAID THAT PREVIOUSLY THE
MAJORITY OF THE VICTIMS WERE PEASANT FAMILIES IN REMOTE AREAS AND THAT
THE VICTIMISATION HAS NOW BEEN EXTENDED TO THE DENSELY POPULARED
DISTRICTS.

   THE VICTIMS INCLUDE HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, TRADE UNIONISTS,
LAWYERS, JOURNALISTS, AND OTHERS WHO TRY TO EXPOSE ABUSES AT THE LOCAL
AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS, THE CABLE SAID. CHILDREN WERE REPORTED TO BE
PRIME TARGETS.

   A RECENT REPORT PUBLISHED BY AMNESTY STATED THAT TORTURE, MURDER,
RAPE, AND DISAPPEARANCES WERE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE PERUVIAN
GOVERNMENT IN COMBATING VIOLENT OPPOSITION GROUPS LIKE THE "SHINING
PATH" GUERRILLAS. IT SAID MOST OF THE VICTIMS WERE SECONDARY SCHOOL
CHILDREN WHO ARE A MAJOR RECRUITMENT TARGET FOR THE SHINING PATH.

   THE BARBADOS-BASED CARIBBEAN RIGHTS STRESSED IN ITS CABLE THAT IT
WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS THE GOVERNMENT WAS FACING WITH THE
GUERRILLAS BUT EMPHASISED THAT IT WAS THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY OF
THE GOVERNMENT TO UPHOLD LAW EVEN IN THE FACE OF VIOLENT OPPOSITION.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 19 JAN 90 (TELEVEN CANAL 10) -- [INTERVIEW
WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ
ZAMORA BY MODERATOR NAPOLEON BRAVO AND TEODORO PETKOFF, LEADER OF THE
VENEZUELAN MOVEMENT FOR SOCIALISM (MAS)] [TEXT] [BRAVO] WE ALREADY
HAVE AUDIO AND VIDEO SIGNALS WITH LIMA AND LA PAZ.  WE TALKED WITH
PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA A FEW MINUTES AGO.  GOOD MORNING AGAIN
PRESIDENT GARCIA.  GOOD MORNING PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA.  CAN YOU HEAR
ME?

   [PAZ ZAMORA] YES, I CAN HEAR YOU.  GOOD MORNING, NAPOLEON BRAVO.
IT IS MY PLEASURE TO BE TALKING TO YOU TODAY.

   [BRAVO] IT IS ALSO A PLEASURE FOR US.  WE HAVE TEODORO PETKOFF,
LEADER OF MAS HERE IN THE STUDIO.  AS YOU, PRESIDENT GARCIA, AND
TEODORO PETKOFF AGREED, THE TOPIC TO BE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY IS LATIN
AMERICA'S FUTURE OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS.  YOU WILL DISCUSS THE
INCREASING IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE CONTINENT, THE POPULATION EXPLOSION,
AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

   THE FIRST QUESTION IS FOR PRESIDENT GARCIA.  MR PRESIDENT, IN YOUR
OPINION AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT LATIN AMERICA IS
CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN DEBT AND ECONOMIC
STAGNATION, WHAT CAN LATIN AMERICA EXPECT OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS?

   [GARCIA] [WORDS INDISTINCT] SOCIALISM, I HAVE, HOWEVER, [WORD
INDISTINCT] DIFFICULT REGARDING LATIN AMERICA'S FUTURE.  WE CANNOT
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE FOREIGN DEBT [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] EXPLOITATION
OF OUR COUNTRIES OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS.  WE CANNOT FORGET THAT OVER
THE PAST 10 YEARS, LATIN AMERICA HAS BEEN EXPORTING CAPITAL AND THAT
[WORDS INDISTINCT] PAID $250 BILLION OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS [WORDS
INDISTINCT], $430,000 AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE DECADE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] $190,000.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] POLITICAL AND MILITARY INTERVENTIONISM [WORDS
INDISTINCT] WHICH THE CASE OF PANAMA CONFIRMS.  [WORDS INDISTINCT]
DEMOCRATIC OR TOTALITARIAN SOCIETIES [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] AND ALL
ENDANGERS THE VERY EXISTENCE OF LATIN AMERICA INSOFAR AS THERE IS NOT
A PROMPT AND VIGOROUS REACTION FROM ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN POLITICAL
LEADERS TO STRENGTHEN OUR PEOPLES' UNITY.  THAT UNITY WILL SERVE AS AN
ANTI-IMPERIALIST INSTRUMENT OF DEFENSE AND AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR SOCIAL
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR OUR CONTINENT OVER THE
NEXT 10 YEARS.  THAT IS THE ESSENTIAL PROTEST OF ALL THE LATIN
AMERICAN MOVEMENTS THAT EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM,
RESPECT FOR LATIN AMERICAN FREEDOM, AND ESPECIALLY RESPECT FOR LATIN
AMERICAN UNITY.

   [BRAVO] THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT.  PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA, I AM GOING
TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION.  IN YOUR OPINION, AND TAKING INTO
ACCOUNT THE INCREASING IMPOVERISHMENT IN LATIN AMERICA, POPULATION
EXPLOSION, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM, THE CURRENT LATIN AMERICAN
ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, ABOUT WHICH IN FACT I
THINK I HEARD -- AND I SAY I THINK, BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EARLY IN THE
MORNING -- OVER THE ECO LATIN AMERICAN TELEVISION NETWORK THIS MORNING
THAT YOU ARE SOLVING THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, WHAT IS LATIN AMERICA'S
FUTURE FOR THE LAST DECADE OF THIS CENTURY?

   [PAZ] MY FRIEND NAPOLEON BRAVO, I HAVE A FAIRLY OPTIMISTIC
VIEWPOINT WITH REGARD TO LATIN AMERICA'S FUTURE FOR THIS LAST DECADE
OF THE CENTURY.  I BELIEVE WE MUST ADMIT THAT DESPITE ALL THE
DIFFICULTIES, THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, THE MISERY THAT EXISTS ON OUR
CONTINENT, THE POPULATION EXPLOSION, AND OTHER PROBLEMS, SINCE THE
LATIN AMERICAN REPUBLICS WERE FORMED, OUR CONTINENT HAS NEVER BEEN
BETTER THAN TODAY.  IN OTHER WORDS, SINCE THE LATIN AMERICAN REPUBLICS
WERE FORMED, WE HAVE NEVER HAD ALMOST 90 PERCENT OF THE CONTINENT
LIVING WITHIN DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS AS WE DO NOW.  WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE
PERSPECTIVES WE HAD TODAY.  I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF MY
COUNTRY, OF LATIN AMERICA, AND ESPECIALLY OF OUR THREE COUNTRIES.

   I AM SO OPTIMISTIC THAT I EVEN WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT
TOUCHES OUR SOULS.  WE WILL BEGIN THE DECADE BY WINNING THE WORLD
SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP IN ITALY.  WE MUST NOT UNDERESTIMATE SOCCER,
BECAUSE SOCCER IS CULTURE, TOO, AND REPRESENTS OUR PEOPLES' STRENGTH.

   TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT MINE IS AN OPTIMISTIC POINT OF VIEW, I
WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS, LATIN AMERICA WILL
FACE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS.  ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS WILL BE TO FIND A
WAY TO REJOIN AN ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, AND COMMERCIAL WORLD FROM WHICH
LATIN AMERICA WAS GRADUALLY EXPELLED DURING THE LAST DECADE AND EVEN
DURING THE 1970'S.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 19 JAN 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [STATEMENT]
[TEXT] IN RESPONSE TO REPORTS DISSEMINATED BY THE MEDIA WITH REGARD TO
THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TERRORISM, THE COLOMBIAN
PRESIDENT ADVISES THE COLOMBIA PEOPLE OF THE FOLLOWING:

   1. THE GOVERNMENT'S FIRM, COHERENT, AND EFFICIENT POLICY TO ENFORCE
THE LAW HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WITH REGARD TO THE CONTROL OF DRUG
TRAFFICKING AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THAT POLICY HAS CREATED A NEW
SITUATION, WHICH HAS RAISED A NUMBER OF EXPECTATIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE.

   2. THE ACTIONS CONDUCTED BY THE ARMED FORCES, THE NATIONAL POLICE,
AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED OUT TO COMPLETE THE DISMANTLING OF
GROUPS OF MURDERERS AND NARCO-TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.

   3. THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE ALL THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES
WILL CONTINUE TO FULFILL THEIR DUTY OF ENFORCING THE LAW AND BRINGING
CRIMINALS BEFORE JUSTICE ACCORDING TO CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL
PROCEDURES AND THE OPTIONS OFFERED BY THE LAW.

   4. THE STATEMENTS BY FOUR FORMER COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTS, BY THE
CARDINAL AND ARCHBISHOP OF COLOMBIA, AND BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE
PATRIOTIC UNION ARE PATRIOTIC ACTIONS INTENDED TO SPARE COLOMBIANS
MORE SUFFERING AND PAIN.  THE GOVERNMENT HIGHLY APPRECIATES THE
MEANING OF THOSE STATEMENTS.  THOSE STATEMENTS REPRESENT THE THREE
COLOMBIAN PARTIES AND THE CHURCH. [SENTENCE AS HEARD]

   5. THE COUNTRY HAS ACTED WITH CALM, CAUTION, REALISM, AND
RESPONSIBILITY.  THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE DID NOT LET THEMSELVES BE
CARRIED AWAY BY RECKLESS EXPECTATIONS.  THE COUNTRY MUST MAINTAIN THAT
ATTITUDE.

   6. AUTHORIZED MEDIA SPOKESMEN HAVE MENTIONED THE MANY QUESTIONS
THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ASK THEMSELVES CONCERNING THAT SITUATION,
WHICH ONLY THE FUTURE CAN CONVINCINGLY CLARIFY.

   7. THE COUNTRY LONGS FOR THE COMPLETE END TO CRIMES, MURDERS, AND
ATTACKS AGAINST PUBLIC OFFICIALS, NEWSMEN, POLITICAL LEADERS, AND MEN,
WOMEN, AND CHILDREN.  THE COUNTRY LONGS FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED AND THE DEFINITIVE SUSPENSION OF DRUG
TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES.

   THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY AND THE ENORMOUS SACRIFICES COURAGEOUSLY
MADE BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE SEEK THOSE OBJECTIVES, AMONG OTHER
THINGS.

   8. NOW THAT THE STATE'S VICTORY AND THE NEED TO ABIDE BY THE
COUNTRY'S LAW ARE ADMITTED, WE MUST WALK ALONG THE BEST PATH TO ENSURE
THE FINAL SUCCESS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY, WHICH HAS BEEN SUPPORTED
BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [ARTICLE] [MARISOL MARIN] [TEXT]
SALVADORAN COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES GAVE THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE SIX
JESUIT PRIESTS WITH A PEREMPTORY SENTENCE: "EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE; IT IS
EITHER US OR THEM.  THESE HAVE BEEN THE INTELLECTUALS WHO HAVE BEEN GUIDING
THE GUERRILLA GROUPS FOR A LONG TIME."

   THIS IS STATED IN A RESOLUTION ISSUED THIS MORNING BY JUDGE RICARDO
ZAMORA WHO ORDERED A PROVISIONAL ARREST WHILE WAITING FOR THE TRIAL OF
THE EIGHT MILITARY OFFICERS IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME AND THE ARREST OF
A THIRD ONE WHO HAS BEEN AT LARGE SINCE DECEMBER.

   TWO LIEUTENANTS AND A SECOND LIEUTENANT HAVE ACCUSED BENAVIDES IN
THEIR DEPOSITIONS AS THE PERSON WHO "GAVE THE ORDER" ON THE EVENING 15
NOVEMBER AT THE MILITARY SCHOOL HE DIRECTED AND WHICH WAS IN CHARGE OF
CONTROLLING THE SECTOR WHERE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UCA) IS
LOCATED.

   "WE WILL START WITH THE LEADERS.  THE UNIVERSITY IS IN OUR SECTOR
AND ELLACURIA IS THERE.  HE MUST BE ELIMINATED AND I WANT NO
WITNESSES," BENAVIDES SAID TO LIEUTENANT YUSSAY RENE MENDOZA
VALLECILLOS, ACCORDING TO THE LATTER'S TESTIMONY.

   A FEW HOURS LATER, EARLY IN THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, JESUIT
PRIESTS IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF THE UCA; IGNACIO MARTIN BARO,
JUAN RAMON MORENO, JOAQUIN LOPEZ Y LOPEZ, SEGUNDO MONTES (SPANIARDS),
AND AMANDO LOPEZ (SALVADORAN), AS WELL AS THEIR COOK, ELBA JULIA
RAMOS, AND HER DAUGHTER, CELINA MARICET RAMOS, WERE ASSASSINATED.

   IT ALL HAPPENED DURING THE CURFEW AND 5 DAYS AFTER THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLA GROUPS HAD LAUNCHED
THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE.

   BENAVIDES GAVE THE ORDER TO LIEUTENANT MENDOZA, LIEUTENANT
ESPINOZA, AND SECOND LIEUTENANT GUEVARA CERRITOS, OFFICERS OF THE
ATLACATL BATTALION, AN ELITE UNIT TRAINED BY THE UNITED STATES, WHICH
HAD BEEN SENT TO THE MILITARY SCHOOL.

   THE SOLDIERS WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NECESSARY "TO ELIMINATE THE
GUERRILLA GROUPS' INTELLECTUAL LEADERS AND THAT THEY WERE AT THE UCA,"
ACCORDING TO CORPORAL ANGEL PEREZ VASQUEZ' DEPOSITION.

   THEY WERE ALSO TOLD THAT "THERE WAS INFORMATION THAT SOME INJURED
TERRORIST CRIMINALS WOULD BE TAKEN TO THE UCA" AND THEY WERE
INSISTENTLY TOLD THAT "ALL THE PEOPLE THERE WERE TERRORISTS."

   ACCORDING TO SECOND SERGEANT ANTONIO RAMIRO AVALOS VARGAS' VERSION,
THE MISSION MUST BE SECRETLY CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THEY WOULD FIND
SUBVERSIVE MATERIAL AND OTHER KINDS OF MATERIAL THAT COULD BE USED,
SUCH AS MEDICINE, BOOTS, AND CLOTHES.

   ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY OFFICERS' DEPOSITIONS GATHERED IN THE
JUDGE'S RESOLUTION, A FLARE WOULD BE FIRED WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO
WITHDRAW, TO INDICATE THERE HAD BEEN A CLASH.

   SECOND SERGEANT ANTONIO RAMIRO AVALOS VARGAS SAYS THAT FIVE OF THE
SIX JESUITS WERE TAKEN OUT TO THE GARDEN AND ORDERED TO LIE FACE DOWN,
THEN LIEUTENANT ESPINOZA ORDERED HIM AND PRIVATE MARIANO AMAYA
GRIMALDI TO PROCEED.

   THE THREE OFFICERS ADMITTED THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS, BUT NOT
ABOUT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE CRIME.  THE FOUR SOLDIERS ADMITTED
THEIR ROLE AS EXECUTIONERS, OUT OF LOYALTY TO THEIR SUPERIORS AND
BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED TRAITORS.

   THE JUDGE SAID THERE ARE "ENOUGH ELEMENTS" TO ESTABLISH THE
PARTICIPATION OF COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES IN THESE ACTIONS,
INCLUDING, FIRST OF ALL, THE DEPOSITION SIGNED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO
PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.

   PONCE SAID HE ORDERED THE CREATION OF A SECURITY COMMANDO, WITH
HEADQUARTERS IN THE MILITARY SCHOOL AND UNDER COLONEL GUILLERMO
ALFREDO BENAVIDES' COMMAND, TO DEFEND THE MILITARY INSTALLATIONS
LOCATED IN THE ZONE WHICH MIGHT BECOME THE TARGETS OF "A TERRORIST
AGGRESSION."  THE UCA IS ALSO LOCATED IN THE ZONE.

   THE JUDICIAL RESOLUTION INCLUDES THE DEPOSITIONS GIVEN BY ALL THE
PRISONERS TO THE POLICE, EXCEPT COL BENAVIDES, WHO MET WITH JUDGE
RICARDO ZAMORA FOR OVER 2 HOURS.

   THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT BY A CRIME INVESTIGATION
COMMISSION WHICH LATER SENT THE EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS TO AN ARMY HONOR
COMMISSION THAT WILL COOPERATE IN DETERMING WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 23 JAN 90 (TASS INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [TEXT] FROM THE
SOVIET POINT OF VIEW, THE QUESTION OF DELIVERIES OF WEAPONS TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR TAKES ON, IN PRESENT CONDITIONS, A PARTICULAR
SIGNIFICANCE.  THIS WAS ANNOUNCED TODAY AT A BRIEFING BY GENNADIY GERASIMOV,
HEAD OF THE USSR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS INFORMATION DIRECTORATE, WHO
REPORTED THE DEBATES OPENING IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON GIVING U.S.  MILITARY
AID TO THAT COUNTRY.

   IN RECENT TIMES, THE USSR FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN NOTED, CERTAIN
ADVANCES HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN THE MATTER OF RENEWING DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE OPPOSING SIDES IN EL SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, THE OPPONENTS OF NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION IN THAT COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT A CONSTRUCTIVE
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS AND ARE COUNTING ON THE
CONTINUATION OF BLOODSHED.  THE EL SALVADOR PRESIDENT ALFONSO CRISTIAN
CONFIRMED THE INVOLVEMENT OF TROOPS IN THE MURDER OF PRIESTS.  A NEW
VICTIM OF THE TERROR IS HECTOR OQUELI, EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE
SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON THE PROBLEMS OF THE COUNTRIES OF
LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN BASIN AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT PARTY, SAID GENNADIY GERASIMOV.

   THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT,
THE SOVIET DIPLOMAT NOTED, HAS STATED ITS DECISION TO STOP CONDUCTING
FURTHER COMBAT OPERATIONS IF THE UNITED STATES HALTS ITS MILITARY AID
TO THE RULING REGIME.

   IN THESE CONDITIONS, GERASIMOV STRESSED, THE CONTINUATION OF ARMS
SUPPLIES TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN FACT PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE
WHO BLATANTLY VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS AND DOES NOT PROMOTE THE
STRENGTHENING OF THE POSITIONS OF THOSE WHO CHAMPION DIALOGUE AND
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN EL SALVADOR.  "ALL OF THAT MAY BECOME A
SERIOUS OBSTACLE IN THE WAY TOWARD A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN THAT
COUNTRY AND CENTRAL AMERICA IN GENERAL", HE SAID.

NEWSPAPER DIRECTOR HERNANDO SANTOS CASTILLO.  IN THIS COMMUNIQUE, ESCOBAR
DENIED THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL IS DIVIDED AND STRESSED THAT THOSE WHO TOLD
ON GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA WERE CALI CARTEL MEMBERS.  FOR SEVERAL MONTHS,
ESCOBAR'S GROUP HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A FIGHT TO THE DEATH WITH THE MEMBERS OF
THE CALI CARTEL.

   ESCOBAR'S COMMUNIQUE EVEN GIVES THE NAME OF THE PERSON WHO
COLLECTED THE REWARD FROM THE AUTHORITIES, A REWARD THAT HAD BEEN
ANNOUNCED ON TELEVISION AS A PRIZE FOR DENOUNCING EL MEJICANO
[RODRIGUEZ GACHA'S ALIAS].

   HERE IS MORE ON THIS COMMUNIQUE:

   IN A NEW EXCHANGE OF COMMUNIQUES, A PRACTICE THAT HAS BECOME COMMON
NOWADAYS, ESCOBAR DECIDED TO WRITE A LETTER TO SANTOS TO CLARIFY
CERTAIN DOUBTS: FIRST, TO SAY THAT HIS FRIENDS AND COLLABORATORS HAVE
NOT WITHDRAWN THEIR SUPPORT AS A RESULT OF A CAMPAIGN CARRIED OUT BY
THE 4TH BRIDAGE IN ANTIOQUIA, AS REPORTED IN EL TIEMPO.  ESCOBAR
STRESSED THAT THE BEST PROOF THAT HIS FRIENDS HAVE NOT BETRAYED OR
ABANDONED HIM IS THAT HE IS STILL FREE.  SECOND, HE SAID THAT IF THE
GOVERNMENT EVER DECIDES TO FIGHT FOR PEACE, IT WILL FIND A LONG,
ENDLESS LIST OF EXTRADITABLES, DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HENCHMEN, AND
PARAMILITARY GROUP MEMBERS WHO WANT TO ACCOMPANY THE GOVERNMENT IN
THAT PROCESS.  THIRD, HE ACCUSED JORGE VELAZQUEZ, A MEMBER OF THE CALI
CARTEL WHOSE ALIAS IS "THE NAVIGATOR," OF DENOUNCING RODRIGUEZ GACHA
AND COLLECTING THE REWARD.  HE ALSO ACCUSED CALI CARTEL MEMBERS OF
DENOUNCING JORGE LUIS OCHOA IN PALMIRA AND OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DISAPPEARANCE AND MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA PEOPLE WHO VISITED VALLE DEL
CAUCA DEPARTMENT.  ESCOBAR ALSO CHARGED THAT CALI CARTEL MEMBERS
PLACED 700 KG OF DYNAMITE IN HIS FAMILY'S BUILDING.  FOURTH, HE NOTED
THAT HIS STRUGGLE IS AGAINST THE CALI CARTEL NOT THE VALLE DEL CAUCA
PEOPLE AND ADDED: I FEEL GREAT ADMIRATION AND PROFOUND RESPECT FOR
VALLE PEOPLE BECAUSE MY WIFE, VICTORIA, WAS BORN IN THAT BEAUTIFUL
LAND, HER ANCESTORS ALL LIVED THERE.  CONCLUDING HE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH
HE HAS NEVER ACCEPTED THE CALI CARTEL'S PEACE PROPOSAL, HE HAS NEVER
REJECTED DIALOGUE AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR SOLUTIONS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 24 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE EMILIO
PONCE, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, TODAY DISCLOSED AN
ALLEGED PLAN ACCORDING TO WHICH THE GUERRILLAS WILL ATTEMPT TO ATTACK
MILITARY POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR "TO PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT INTO
NEGOTIATING A POLITICAL SOLUTION" TO THE ARMED CONFLICT.

   CITING MILITARY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS, PONCE ANTICIPATED THAT "AS OF
NEXT WEEKEND, UNTIL 10 FEBRUARY, THE GUERRILLAS WILL CARRY OUT
TERRORIST ACTIONS AND ATTACKS ON MILITARY UNITS, PRIMARILY IN THE
METROPOLITAN AREA, IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
IN A PROPAGANDISTIC MANNER."

   "THEY ARE TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SO THAT
IT, IN TURN, WILL MOVE TOWARD NEGOTIATING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE
ARMED CONFLICT," PONCE SAID DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE GENERAL
STAFF'S HEADQUARTERS.

   THE EXECUTION OF THE ALLEGED FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) PLAN WILL COINCIDE WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI'S SCHEDULED TRIP TO THE UNITED NATIONS AT THE END OF THE
MONTH.

   CRISTIANI WILL MEET ON 31 JANUARY WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER
PEREZ DE CUELLAR, TO REQUEST HIS GOOD OFFICES IN FAVOR OF RESUMING THE
DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS, WHICH WAS SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER.

   FOLLOWING NOVEMBER'S GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN
HAVE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE, WITH UNITED
NATIONS PARTICIPATION.

   PONCE POINTED OUT THAT THE "SPECIFIC AREAS" THE GUERRILLAS WILL
ATTEMPT TO ATTACK ARE SOME OF THE MILITARY POSITIONS AT THE EL ESPINO
FARM IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR, AYUTUXTEPEQUE IN THE
NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ZARAGOZA AND HUIZUCAR IN THE SOUTHERN
PART OF SAN SALVADOR, AND SOYAPANGO IN THE EAST.

   THESE AREAS ARE AMONG THE LEADING SITES OF THE BLOODIEST CLASHES
BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS DURING THE REBELS' HARSHEST OFFENSIVE
11 NOVEMBER.

   THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND REBELS WAS
SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER FOLLOWING A DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST A LABOR UNION
HEADQUARTERS IN WHICH 10 WORKERS WERE KILLED AND 30 OTHERS WOUNDED.

   PRIOR TO THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIALOGUE, THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN
HELD TWO ROUNDS OF TALKS IN MEXICO AND COSTA RICA, BUT FAILED TO REACH
AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE ENDED THE COUNTRY'S ARMED CONFLICT.

BY THE COCAINE CULTIVATED AND PRODUCED BY PERUVIAN, BOLIVIAN, AND
COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHEN IT IS PEDDLED ON THE STREETS OF THE
UNITED STATES AND EUROPE IS $140 BILLION ANNUALLY.

   ACCORDING TO THE EXPERTS, COCAINE TRAFFICKING IN COLOMBIA MAY TOTAL
$100 MILLION IF RETAIL SALES IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ARE TAKEN
INTO ACCOUNT.

   THIS ILLEGAL TRADE, WHICH AMOUNTS TO 10 PERCENT OF THE WORLD ARMS
TRADE VOLUME, MAY COME TO AN END IF THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS
THE PEACE OFFER FROM "THE EXTRADITABLES," ARMED WING OF THE MEDELLIN
CARTEL.

   OF THE $140 MILLION, THE TAKE OF THE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS ON
A WHOLESALE BASIS IS ONLY $7.13 BILLION ANNUALLY, ACCORDING TO A STUDY
MADE BY CARLOS CABALLERO ARGAEZ, PRESIDENT OF THE COLOMBIAN BANKING
ASSOCIATION.

   ACCORDING TO CABALLERO, WHEN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS, INPUT,
TRANSPORTATION, SECURITY, AND CONFISCATIONS IS DEDUCTED, THE NET
ANNUAL EARNINGS OF THE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS TOTAL $4.060
BILLION.

   CABALLERO ASSERTS THAT THE COLOMBIAN TRAFFICKERS EXPORT A TOTAL OF
310 TONS PER YEAR, OF WHICH 270 TONS ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AT
AN AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE OF $19,000 PER KILOGRAM, AND 40 TONS IN
EUROPE AT $50,000 PER KILOGRAM.

   THE EXPERT TOLD EFE THAT THE NETWORKS OF PEDDLERS SELL THE COCAINE
AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $200,000 PER KILOGRAM, AND THEREFORE THEIR
GROSS TAKE MAY BE $62 BILLION PER YEAR.

   IF THE EXTRA PROFITS RESULTING FROM DILUTING THE POWDER BY MIXING
IT WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES IS ADDED TO THIS AMOUNT, THEIR GROSS EARNINGS
MAY AMOUNT TO $100 BILLION PER YEAR.

   THE DEA'S ESTIMATE OF $140 BILLION IS REACHED BY ADDING TO THE $100
BILLION THAT THE COLOMBIAN COCAINE FINALLY GENERATES ABOUT $40 BILLION
GENERATED BY PERUVIAN AND COLOMBIAN NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.

   CABALLERO ASSERTS THAT COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS INVEST
APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF THE NET EARNINGS OF $4.060 BILLION IN
COLOMBIA.

   ACCORDING TO THE COLOMBIAN FEDERATION OF REAL ESTATE MARKETS AND UN
CONSULTANTS, THIS MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED IN 1 MILLION HECTARES OF
FARMLAND AND RANGES, BUILDINGS, INDUSTRIES, AND TOURISM BUSINESSES.

   THE $1 BILLION THE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE INVESTED
ANNUALLY IN COLOMBIA DURING THE 1980'S REPRESENTS 2.8 PERCENT OF THE
COUNTRY'S $35 BILLION GNP.

   ACCORDING TO THE DEA, THE 270 TONS OF COCAINE THAT ARRIVE IN THE
UNITED STATES FROM COLOMBIA REPRESENT 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE
CONSUMED IN THAT COUNTRY.

   DEA SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE CALI CARTEL, THE OTHER COLOMBIAN
MAFIA ORGANIZATION AND SECOND LARGEST AFTER THE MEDELLIN CARTEL,
CONTROLS THE WHOLESALE MARKET IN NEW YORK AND PART OF THAT IN LOS
ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO.

   THE STRUGGLE FOR THOSE MARKETS RESULTED LAST YEAR IN WHAT THE
POLICE DUBBED THE "WAR AMONG THE CARTELS," AND IN THE KILLING OF 100
MEMBERS FROM BOTH ORGANIZATIONS.

   ACCORDING TO STATISTICS FROM THE COLOMBIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY,
3,000 PERSONS DIE FROM DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR,
WHILE ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO CAUSE 520,000 DEATHS PER YEAR THERE.

   BOGOTA, 25 JAN 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN AND VENEZUELAN
AUTHORITIES ARE FACED WITH A SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL EMERGENCY TONIGHT
FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION OF A POWERFUL BOMB PLACED BY GUERRILLAS AT THE
MAIN OIL PIPELINE IN COLOMBIA, CAUSING MORE THAN 15,000 BARRELS OF OIL
TO SPILL AND REACH THE CATATUMBO RIVER ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES.

   REPORTS IN BOGOTA POINT OUT THAT THE OIL SPILL, WHICH IS
APPROXIMATELY 3 KM LONG, IS SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD THE CATATUMBO RIVER,
THREATENING TO REACH VENEZUELA'S MARACAIBO LAKE WITHIN HOURS.

   THE DYNAMITE ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED, ACCORDING TO COLOMBIAN
AUTHORITIES, BY THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN), WHICH IS
CONSIDERED THE MOST RADICAL REBEL GROUP OF THE MANY OPERATING IN THE
COUNTRY.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, MEMBERS OF THAT INSURGENT ORGANIZATION
COMPLETELY BLEW UP A STRETCH OF THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE,
IN AN AREA CLOSE TO TEORAMA IN NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.

   SINCE LAST YEAR THE ELN, WHICH IS HEADED BY SEVERAL FORMER SPANISH
PRIESTS, HAS PERPETRATED OVER 30 ATTACKS AGAINST COLOMBIAN OIL
INSTALLATIONS TO PROTEST THE JOINT EXPLOITATION OF CRUDE BY THE
GOVERNMENT AND MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES.

   TEGUCIGALPA, NO DATE (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH BORGE] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [MATERO] MILTON MATEO OF HRN, COMMANDER
BORGE.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM EL SALVADOR,
YOU SAID THAT YOU HOPED FOR AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN REBELS
AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT.  YOU, LIKE ALL CENTRAL
AMERICANS, WANT PEACE, BUT DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THIS RUNS CONTRARY TO
THE FACT THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS PRESENTED RELIABLE PROOF
OF MILITARY AID [FROM NICARAGUA] TO THE LEFTIST SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS,
AND RECENTLY, AN ARMED FORCES PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER SAID THAT
NICARAGUA IS A SANCTUARY FOR A SUBVERSIVE GROUP KNOWN AS THE
CINCHONEROS OF HONDURAS?

   [BORGE] AS FOR THE STATEMENT THAT NICARAGUA IS A SANCTUARY FOR A
HONDURAN GUERRILLA GROUP, I WISH TO SAY THAT THE STATEMENT IS NOT ONLY
FALSE, BUT A SERIOUS CHARGE.  I INVITE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO COME TO
NICARAGUA, INCLUDING THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES, TO DO SO.  WE WILL GIVE
THEM ABSOLUTE FREEDOM TO SHOW WHERE THE CINCHONEROS CAMPS ARE LOCATED,
WHERE THEIR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED OR THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE BEING
CARRIED OUT.  IF THIS EXISTS, IT CANNOT BE HIDDEN.  IT IS VERY
DIFFICULT TO HIDE A MILITARY TRAINING CAMP.  I ASSURE THE HONDURAN
GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE VERY SERIOUSLY AND WITH A HIGH SENSE OF
RESPONSIBILITY, THAT NICARAGUA WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR
GUERRILLA GROUPS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH CAMPS IN NICARAGUA,
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CONCERNS HONDURAS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ABOUT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS?

   [BORGE] MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT EL SALVADOR.  IT IS SAID
THAT WE SUPPLY WEAPONS TO THE SALVADORAN REVOLUTIONARIES.  THIS CHARGE
HAS BEEN MADE FOR MANY YEARS.  I COULD SAY THAT THE AIRPLANE THAT WE
DOWNED IN NICARAGUA, FLOWN BY THE FAMOUS HASENFUS, CAME FROM EL
SALVADOR, BUT WHY BRING THAT UP?  THE FACT IS THAT THERE EXISTS IN THE
WORLD A POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, KNOWN AS THE CIA, WHICH HAS
ENORMOUS TECHNICAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES THAT CAN ENABLE IT TO
ACCURATELY DETERMINE WHAT IS HAPPENING ANYWHERE, AND YET IT HAS NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NICARAGUA IS PROVIDING WEAPONS TO ANY
ARMED MOVEMENT ANYWHERE.  THEREFORE, LET US PUT THAT INTO THE SAME
CONTEXT AS THE STATEMENT THAT OUR RELATIONS WITH CUBA ARE COOLING.  WE
COULD ALSO POINT OUT OTHER LIES TOLD ABOUT US.  WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED
OF ALL KINDS OF THINGS.  WE HAVE BEEN CALLED DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE ARE
ACCUSED OF BURNING DOWN A JEWISH SYNAGOGUE IN NICARAGUA.
INCIDENTALLY, LET ME TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A JEWISH
SYNAGOGUE IN NICARAGUA, YET THIS WAS SAID BY NO LESS THAN U.S.
PRESIDENT REAGAN.

   THUS, THEY TELL ALL THOSE LIES ABOUT NICARAGUA AND THAT IS ONE OF
THE THINGS THAT THEY SAY, JUST AS THEY SAY THAT WE ARE THE ENEMIES OF
HUMAN RIGHTS, THAT WE PERSECUTE CLERGYMEN.  NOTE THAT IN NICARAGUA NO
PRIEST HAS EVER BEEN IMPRISONED, MURDERED, OR EXILED, EXCEPT ON ONE
OCCASION BECAUSE OF VERY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.  IN NICARAGUA, WE HAVE
MADE CONSCIENTIOUS EFFORTS TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT THE MAIN
ACCUSATION LEVELED AGAINST OUR COUNTRY IS FAILURE TO RESPECT HUMAN
RIGHTS.

   WE ARE ACCUSED OF PLANNING ELECTORAL FRAUD.  THERE WAS A POLL DONE
BY A U.S. FIRM THAT GIVES THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FSLN]...  [CHANGES THOUGHT] I WISH TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS
NOT A SANDINIST COMPANY; IT MIGHT HAVE VERY LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR
SANDINISM, BUT IT IS APPARENTLY A RELIABLE COMPANY.  IT GIVES THE FSLN
A MAJORITY OF 51 PERCENT, AND THE NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION [UNO] --
ONE OF THE POLITICAL FORCES PARTICIPATING IN THE ELECTORAL CONTEST --
24 PERCENT.

   OTHER POLLS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN HAVE GIVEN THE FSLN CLOSE TO 69
PERCENT, AS OPPOSED TO UNO, TO WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTED 27 PERCENT.  YET,
WHAT IS BEING SAID?  THAT THERE WILL BE ELECTORAL FRAUD.  THEREFORE,
THAT CHARGE AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, LIKE THIS ONE WHICH
GREATLY BOTHERS ME, TO THE EFFECT THAT WE ARE HARBORING SUBVERSIVE
GROUPS FOR THEM TO COME TO HONDURAS... [CHANGES THOUGHT] I CAN
GUARANTEE TO THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND TO THE NEW HONDURAN
GOVERNMENT THAT IN NICARAGUA WE WILL NOT TAKE A SINGLE STEP IN THAT
DIRECTION.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [BORGE] ON PANAMA, I DO NOT NEED TO SAY ANYTHING.  THE FACTS SPEAK
FOR THEMSELVES.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1070 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 15 JAN 90 (EL MUNDO) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO MERINO LOPEZ HAS SAID THAT "THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REPEAT A TERRORIST ATTACK
LIKE THE ONE LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE THE LOGISTICAL
OR OTHER NECESSARY SUPPORT AT THIS TIME, NOR WILL IT HAVE SUCH SUPPORT IN
THE MONTHS TO COME."

   MERINO SAID THAT THE FMLN REPEATS ITS TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN
CYCLES THAT MUST BE BROKEN TO PREVENT FURTHER SUFFERING AND BLOODSHED.

   THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAVE LOST
GROUND IN EVERY WAY AND THE DIALOGUE MUST BE RESUMED AS THE ONLY WAY
TO ACHIEVE A FIRM AND LASTING PEACE IN THE COUNTRY.

   "THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS NEVER BEEN NAIVE REGARDING THE
FMLN'S LACK OF SINCERITY DURING THE DIALOGUE, BUT IT IS OUR DUTY TO
SEEK PEACE THROUGH REASON, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE AWARE OF THE FMLN'S
WARLIKE ATTITUDE," MERINO SAID.

   REGARDING THE FMLN'S DESIRE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETING TO BE
HELD BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC WITH THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF
THE UNITED NATIONS IN NEW YORK, MERINO SAID THE GUERRILLAS CANNOT HOPE
TO BE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR.

   "THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO NEW YORK TO EXPRESS, ONCE AGAIN, THE
SINCERITY WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO ACHIEVE PEACE THROUGH
DIALOGUE.  THE FMLN'S HOPE OF HAVING A TETE-A-TETE WITH THE PRESIDENT
AT THE UNITED NATIONS IS TOTALLY ABSURD," THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID.

   MERINO SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA'S ONLY WAY OUT IS TO GIVE UP THE
ARMED STRUGGLE AND JOIN IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC LIFE, ALTHOUGH HE
CONCEDED THAT THE PROCESS WILL BE DIFFICULT AND THAT IT WILL NATURALLY
HAVE TO BE GRADUAL IN ORDER FOR THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS TO FEEL SAFE
"WITHOUT HAVING A WEAPON AT THE READY."

   ON THE OTHER HAND, IN REFERENCE TO THE CASE OF THE JESUITS, IN
WHICH MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED, MERINO ADVISED
CAUTION REGARDING STATEMENTS THAT VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY MIGHT
MAKE.

   "PRUDENCE IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET TO THE TRUTH," MERINO SAID.
HE POINTED OUT THAT THE ADVANCES MADE IN INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CASE
PROVE THE DEGREE OF DEMOCRACY THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY.  


DEV-MUC3-1071 (TRW)

   CLANDESTINE, 28 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, LIFETIME PRESIDENT OF ARENA [NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], HAS SAID THAT THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER ARRESTS
OR DETENTIONS OF SOLDIERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE JESUIT MURDER CASE.

   THE GOVERNMENT'S STRONGMAN HAS SAID IT IS OVER, PERIOD.
D'AUBUISSON INSISTS THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER MILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN
THE JESUIT CASE, ACCORDING TO A HEADLINE IN TODAY'S LA PRENSA GRAFICA,
IN WHICH IT PUBLISHES D'AUBUISSON'S STATEMENTS.

   WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE WILL SUMMON D'AUBUISSON
TO PRESENT THE EVIDENCE THAT HAS LED HIM TO ASSERT CATEGORICALLY THAT
NO OTHER SENIOR OFFICERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE
PRIESTS.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE SO, BECAUSE THAT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE HAS
NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED TO SUMMON OR TO INQUIRE, NOT EVEN TO SUMMON THE
MAIN SUSPECT IN THE MURDERS, WHICH HAVE BEEN BLAMED ON THE DEATH
SQUADS.  ONE OF THEM IS FORMER PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WHO
ACCUSED HIM OF BEING THE MASTERMIND OF MSGR ROMERO'S ASSASSINATION.
YET, D'AUBUISSON GOES ON COMPLETELY UNSCATHED.

   THEREFORE, ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON TODAY PLACED A FINAL PERIOD ON THE
INVESTIGATION OF COLONEL [GUILLERMO] BENAVIDES.  OBVIOUSLY,
MAJOR D'AUBUISSON, THE ARENA STRONGMAN, IS PLACING A FINAL PERIOD ON
THE CASE, AND HE IS TELLING THIS DIRECTLY AND PUBLICLY TO CRISTIANI,
THE YANKEES, AND THE REST OF LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966
GRADUATING CLASS OF CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].

   IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR ARENA MEMBERS TO TELL CRISTIANI HOW FAR TO GO
WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  THEY NEVER APPROVED OF HAVING EVEN THE
LIEUTENANTS OF THE ATLACATL BATTALION INVESTIGATED.  THE HEATED
ARGUMENTS WITHIN THE ARENA LEADERSHIP HAVE DESTABILIZED THE GOVERNMENT
TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT MERINO'S SUDDEN FALL IS BUT THE TIP OF THE
ICEBERG AND D'AUBUISSON'S SIGNAL TO STOP A SHOW OF FORCE.  D'AUBUISSON
BELIEVES THAT SERVING UP BENAVIDES' HEAD IS MORE THAN ENOUGH, AND THIS
IS THE FRANK MESSAGE THAT ARENA AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE SENDING TO THE
U.S.  CONGRESS, PRECISELY AT THE TIME THE YANKEE POLICY ON EL SALVADOR
IS UNDER SERIOUS SCRUTINY.

   THE STRONGMAN IS TELLING LA TANDONA: DO NOT WORRY ANY MORE.  WE HAD
TO GIVE SOMETHING TO THE CONGRESS, BUT CRISTIANI'S MODERATION WILL GO
JUST SO FAR.  D'AUBUISSON CONTINUES TO BE THE STRONGMAN.

   SAN SALVADOR, 29 JAN 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] TODAY, 2 DAYS
BEFORE HIS MEETING WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR,
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REAFFIRMED HIS WILLINGNESS TO HOLD TALKS WITH
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  HOWEVER, CRISTIANI
SAID, THE FLMN IS SENDING CONTRADICTORY SIGNALS ON ITS COMMITMENT TO PEACE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MARCO ANTONIO GUEVARA, CORRESPONDENT] A FEW HOURS
BEFORE DEPARTING ON HIS TRIP TO WASHINGTON TODAY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC REITERATED HIS WILLINGNESS TO RESUME A DIALOGUE WITH THE
FMLN, WHICH, HE SAID, IS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR HIS VISIT TO THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL.

   [CRISTIANI] THE MAIN GOAL IS TO HOLD A WORK SESSION WITH THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL.  THIS WILL BE ON 31 JANUARY.  THE GOAL IS TO SEARCH
FOR AND COME UP WITH ANY MECHANISMS THAT COULD EASE THE RESUMPTION OF
THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, SO ALL VIOLENT ACTIONS CEASE AND SO WE CAN
SEARCH FOR AN AGREEMENT FOR THE REINCORPORATION OF THE FMLN THROUGH
POLITICAL MEANS.  THEN WE WILL HOLD A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH ON 1
FEBRUARY IN WASHINGTON.  WE WILL ALSO VISIT OTHER GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS.

   [GUEVARA] THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, WHO JUST RETURNED FROM HONDURAS
WHERE HE MET U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS, TOLD NEWSMEN TODAY THAT HE HAS RECEIVED OFFERS FROM THE
VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE IN VENEZUELA.

   [CRISTIANI] WE ARE DETERMINED TO SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO THE
CONFLICT THROUGH DIALOGUE.  THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT WE WILL DISCUSS
WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL PEREZ DE CUELLAR -- SEARCHING FOR ELEMENTS
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS POSSIBLE.  REGARDING THE FMLN, WE SEE SOME
CONTRADICTORY INDICATIONS AT THIS TIME.  IN SOME COMMUNIQUES, THE FMLN
IS SOMEHOW EXPRESSING THE DESIRE TO RETURN TO THE DIALOGUE PROCESS,
BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THE FMLN CONTINUES
TRYING TO PLAN SOME ATTACKS ON SAN SALVADOR, IN ADDITION TO OTHER
TERRORIST ACTIONS AIMED AT THE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.  WE BELIEVE
THIS IS CONTRADICTORY.  HOWEVER, I MYSELF BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME
POSITIVE ELEMENTS THAT WILL PERMIT RESUMING A DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT
COULD BRING SOME BENEFITS.

   [GUEVARA] ASKED ABOUT REPORTS BY THE SAN SALVADOR AUXILIARY BISHOP
REGARDING SEARCHES AT SOME CATHOLIC CHURCH OFFICES, CRISTIANI SAID
THIS SHOULD NOT BE SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT, BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN FOR
SECURITY REASONS.

   [CRISTIANI] AS PART OF THE THINGS TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY AT
THIS TIME, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME REPORTS HAVE BEEN TOTALLY WRONG.
HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN AT ALL AS A SIGN OF
SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT.  THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FOR SECURITY
REASONS, BASED ON REPORTS WE HAVE RECEIVED.  THEREFORE, WE MUST TAKE
ACTION, AND IF THERE IS NOTHING...[CHANGES THOUGHT].  THOSE
WHO HAVE NO PROBLEM AND HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL MATTERS
SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.

   [GUEVARA] THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID HE IS PLEASED WITH THE
STATEMENTS BY NEW HONDURAN PRESIDENT RAFAEL CALLEJAS, WHO EXPRESSED
HIS TOTAL SUPPORT FOR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN.  CONCERNING AN
UPCOMING CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT NO DATE HAS
BEEN SET YET AND HE BELIEVES THIS CANNOT BE DONE BEFORE THE NICARAGUAN
ELECTIONS.  [END RECORDING] 


DEV-MUC3-1073 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 29 JAN 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS TODAY HAS SAID THERE IS NO NEED OR REASON FOR THE
UNITED STATES TO SUSPEND AID TO THE COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, SHOULD WE GET TO THAT
POINT, THE ARMED FORCES ARE READY TO CONTINUE DEFENDING THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALFREDO VILLARREAL, CORRESPONDENT] COL VARGAS
BELIEVES THE U.S. AID IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE
PROVIDED TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY, BUT ALSO A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY.  THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID IT IS
NOT POSSIBLE THAT A MINORITY, AS HE TERMED THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WILL AFFECT, WITH ITS
DISINFORMATION METHODS AIMED AT COUNTRIES ABROAD, U.S. MILITARY AID
BEING CUT OFF OR DECREASED.  HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE, COL VARGAS SAID
THAT IF THE AID IS SUSPENDED, THIS WOULD COMPLICATE THE ARMED FORCES
PLANS CONCERNING THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STRUGGLE.

   [COL VARGAS] I CERTAINLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE, HAVING A
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, HAVE SO LITTLE CAPACITY TO DEFEND THE TRUTH.  IT
CAN TAKE 100 DAYS TO SPREAD A LIE, BUT YOU CAN TELL THE TRUTH IN 1
DAY.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS CONTEXT....[CHANGES THOUGHT] I
BELIEVE WE ARE OVERESTIMATING THE LEFT-WING ACTIONS.  WE VIEW THEM AS
BEING SMART, AND WE SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLS.  ANY CUT OR SUSPENSION IN
THE AID WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE FURTHER NEEDS
WHENEVER WE NEED TO FULFILL A MISSION.  THEREFORE, MISSIONS WILL BE A
BIT MORE COMPLICATED, BUT WE WILL FULFILL THEM.  IF MARXISTS --
THROUGH THEIR CONCEPT OF DISINFORMATION -- BELIEVE THEY CAN ATTEMPT TO
HARM THE UNITED STATES-EL SALVADOR ALLIANCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS, AND
THAT THIS WILL LEAD THEM TO POWER, THEY ARE COMPLETELY WRONG.  THEY
WILL FIND AN ARMED FORCES WHICH WILL ALWAYS BE FIRMLY DETERMINED TO
DEFEND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   [CORRESPONDENT VILLARREAL] COL VARGAS, IN CHARGE OF THE 3D MILITARY
ZONE IN SAN MIGUEL, SAID HE AGREES WITH THE DECISION TO PROSECUTE THE
EIGHT MILITARY MEN, INCLUDING ONE COLONEL AND TWO LIEUTENANTS, CHARGED
WITH KILLING SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  COL VARGAS SAID THOSE WHO HAVE
BROKEN THE LAW MUST PAY FOR IT, NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE.

   [COL VARGAS] THE ARMY WILL FEEL PAIN IN THE EVENT ANY OF ITS
MEMBERS ARE INVOLVED IN ACTIONS WHICH VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLES THAT RULE
THE ARMED FORCES.  THIS IS VERY PAINFUL.  HOWEVER, IF WE ARE BUILDING
A DEMOCRACY, THERE ARE FACTS THAT MUST BE JUDGED ACCORDING TO THE
NORMS PREVAILING IN A DEMOCRACY.  DEMOCRACY MUST PREVAIL OVER PEOPLE.
DEMOCRACY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN INDIVIDUALS AND THAN INSTITUTIONS IN
INDIVIDUAL TERMS, AND MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE INDIVIDUAL INTEREST OF
PEOPLE OR GROUPS, WHICH CANNOT PREVAIL OVER THE NATIONAL INTEREST.

   [CORRESPONDENT VILLARREAL] IN THE MILITARY ASPECT, COL VARGAS SAID
THAT AS OF 1990, IN HIS AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING
THE PLANS DRAFTED BY THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF KNOWN AS "VICTORY AND
HAMMER" WHICH HAS OFFERED, AS PRELIMINARY RESULTS, 53 CLASHES, 37
GUERRILLAS AND 12 SOLDIERS KILLED, AND WEAPONS SEIZURES.  THE TWO
OPERATIONS, HE ADDED, HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  [END RECORDING] 


DEV-MUC3-1074 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 JAN 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON
THE POLICE IN WASHINGTON ARRESTED THE LEADERS OF A GROUP OF DEMONSTRATORS
WHO HAD GATHERED IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL TO DEMAND THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY
AID TO EL SALVADOR.  A FEW HOURS LATER, REPRESENTATIVES OF SEVERAL CHURCHES
ASSERTED THAT A PERSECUTION HAD BEEN LAUNCHED IN OUR COUNTRY AGAINST
"RELIGIOUS PEOPLE" AND THAT THE AID SHOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR THAT REASON.
THE FOREGONE CONCLUSION WAS THAT, BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF THE AID, OUR
GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE TERRORISTS.

   THIS CAMPAIGN DATES BACK A LONG TIME.  IT BEGAN WITH THE ARRIVAL IN
EL SALVADOR OF SEVERAL JESUIT PRIESTS FROM LOVAINA UNIVERSITY IN THE
EARLY 1960'S AND CONTINUED WITH THE FOUNDING OF UCA [JOSE SIMEON CANAS
CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY], THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF
CERTAIN PRIESTS IN THE SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS, THE AGITATION LAUNCHED BY
THE ALAS [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] PRIESTS, THE TRAGIC EPISODE
INVOLVING MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, AND THE USE OF THAT EPISODE BY
THE LEFT.  EL SALVADOR WAS, AND TO SOME EXTENT CONTINUES TO BE, THE
SCENARIO IN WHICH THE "THEOLOGY OF LIBERATION" REACHED ITS ULTIMATE
CONSEQUENCES BY PLACING THE INQUISITORIAL FANATICISM OF CERTAIN
PRIESTS AND PASTORS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE MOST RADICAL CURRENTS OF
SOCIALISM.

   THE VIRULENCE OF THE ONSLAUGHT WENT THAT FAR PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE
PASSIVE ATTITUDE -- OR, RATHER, THE CONNIVING PERMISSIVENESS -- OF THE
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC REGIME, WHICH TRIED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
STRIDENT CAMPAIGN TO FURTHER ITS OWN POLITICAL ENDS.  DUARTE NEVER
TRULY DISTANCED HIMSELF FAR FROM THE GUERRILLAS BECAUSE OF HIS
ILL-DISGUISED IDEOLOGICAL LEANINGS, WHICH LED HIM TO COINCIDE IN GREAT
PART WITH THE SUBVERSIVES' TENETS AND ABOVE ALL WITH THE FANCIFUL IDEA
THAT THE PEOPLE APPROVED OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMUNIST STATE IN
EL SALVADOR.

   IT IS CERTAINLY DIFFICULT TO COUNTER ORGANIZED SLANDER, TAKING INTO
CONSIDERATION HOW FAR CERTAIN NOTIONS HAVE GONE AND HOW MUCH SUPPORT
THEY RECEIVE FROM THE NEWS MEDIA IN A LARGE PART OF THE WORLD.  THE
POSSIBILITIES OF SUCCESSFULLY COUNTERING THIS PROPAGANDA OFFENSIVE MAY
NOT BE THE BEST, BUT IT WOULD BE WORSE TO REMAIN SILENT AND DO
NOTHING.  WE HAVE YET TO SEE THE ORGANIZATION OF A TRUE EFFORT TO
REJECT THE PERMANENT DEFAMATION BEING WITHSTOOD BY THE COUNTRY.

   THERE IS NO ANSWER TO THE ACCUSATIONS AND INSULTS ISSUED BY CERTAIN
SECTORS, EITHER.  TO ALLOW A PERSON WHO ACTS AS LEADER OF THE
TERRORISTS' POLITICAL FRONT TO COME TO THE COUNTRY AND SCOLD PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI WITHOUT HAVING THE AUTHORITIES ARREST HIM FOR HIS
PARTICIPATION IN CRIMES PERPETRATED AGAINST THE REPUBLIC IS TO FALL
INTO DANGEROUS EXTREMES OF TOLERANCE.  WAS NOT JENNIFER CASOLO ALLOWED
TO OPENLY REPRESENT THE SUBVERSIVES FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT
INVESTIGATING HER MORE CLOSELY?  IS IT PERHAPS THAT THE LAWS ALLOW A
FOREIGNER TO MEDDLE IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS?

   HOW CAN JUDGES BE BANNED FROM CERTAIN INSTALLATIONS, SUCH AS THE THE
BOMBED FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION]
HEADQUARTERS, UNIVERSITIES, AND SIMILAR PLACES, WHEN THERE ARE SUFFICIENT
GROUNDS TO SUSPECT THAT TERRORISTS ARE HIDDEN IN SUCH PLACES?

WITH 19 APRIL MOVEMENT, M-19, LEADER CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ, BY
GLORIA ORTEGA] [TEXT] [ORTEGA] IN A REPORT FOR TELEVISION YESTERDAY
YOU POINTED OUT THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE GUERRILLAS IN COLOMBIA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT KIDNAPPINGS?

   [PIZARRO] WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE ALL HAVE TO BECOME UP TO
DATE, BUT BEING UP TO DATE DOES NOT MEAN WE HAVE TO BECOME DARKER.
QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT MEANS SHEDDING MORE LIGHT ON LIFE.  WE ARE BENT
ON THIS.  OF COURSE, THIS ALSO MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO ABANDON PRACTICES
LIKE KIDNAPPING.

   [ORTEGA] SURELY YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHO YOUR NEMESIS WAS 24 HOURS
AGO.  WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST REGARDING MILITARY TRAINING AND
ORIENTATION IN COLOMBIA?

   [PIZARRO] ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED FOR CENTURIES TO WIN
WARS.  IN COLOMBIA WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE THE MILITARY TO ACHIEVE PEACE,
PARTICULARLY PEACE AT HOME.  THE MILITARY HAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO
MAKE AND THERE ARE VALUABLE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN IT.  THE DEMOCRATIC
LINEAGE DOES NOT EXHAUST ITSELF IN GUERRILLAS, AND THERE IS ALSO A
GREAT DEMOCRATIC QUALITY IN THE ARMED FORCES.

   [ORTEGA] WHAT DO YOU FEEL AFTER KILLING SO MANY POLICEMEN?

   [PIZARRO] WE WILL HAVE TO ASK THE POLICE WHAT THEY THINK AFTER
KILLING SO MANY GUERRILLAS.  WE HAVE LIVED IN VIOLENCE IN THIS
COUNTRY.  QUESTIONS DEALING WITH VIOLENCE AND WAR SHOULD BE AVOIDED.

   [ORTEGA] WHAT DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU PASSED IN FRONT OF THE PALACE
OF JUSTICE YESTERDAY?

   [PIZARRO] I DID NOT DO THAT. I AM STILL LOOKING FORWARD TO WALKING
PAST THE PALACE OF JUSTICE.

   [ORTEGA] WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WILL FEEL AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
PALACE?

   [PIZARRO] WELL, THAT THIS IS SOMETHING TO PONDER.

   [ORTEGA] ACCORDING TO WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED TO ME, SOME
COLOMBIAN SECTORS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU PEOPLE, WHO
STORMED THE PALACE OF JUSTICE, ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE AMONG THE
MOST PROTECTED IN THIS COUNTRY.

   [PIZARRO] I HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW COLOMBIA DEALT WITH THE FACT
THAT SANTANDER WAS THE FIRST MAN PARDONED IN COLOMBIA.

   [ORTEGA] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

   [PIZARRO] THAT MEANS THAT IF SANTANDER, A LAWMAKER, WAS PARDONED
AFTER HIS ATTEMPT ON BOLIVAR'S LIFE, AND WE ARE LIVING IN A NATION
BUILT LARGELY ON WHAT SANTANDER DID, THE LIFE OF MEN IS MADE OF LIGHT
AND SHADES.  AND THEY HAVE TO LIVE AS THEY ARE.

HAVE DENIED THAT THEY ARE PREPARING AN ATTACK ON THE LIFE OF U.S.
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH, WHO WILL VISIT THIS CARIBBEAN COLONIAL BEACH
RESORT ON 15 FEBRUARY FOR AN ANTI-DRUG SUMMIT MEETING.

   BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO, PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, AND U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH
WILL SIGN A MANIFESTO IN CARTAGENA THAT WAS DESIGNED IN SANTA CRUZ DE

WILL ADOPT TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   THE MYSTERIOUS CLANDESTINE GROUP THE "EXTRADITABLES," -- THE ARMED
BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DRUG TRAFFICKERS -- SAID IN A BULLETIN
RELEASED EARLY THIS MORNING THAT THE REPORTS OF A POSSIBLE ATTACK ON
BUSH IN CARTAGENA ARE FALSE.

   "THESE REPORTS ARE PART OF A PLAN TO UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF
ALL OUR PEACE PROPOSALS," THE DOCUMENT SAID.  IN THE DOCUMENT, THE
"EXTRADITABLES" ALSO [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   LAST WEEKEND, THE U.S. CBS TELEVISION NETWORK REPORTED THE
POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTACK WITH ROCKETS AND MISSILES BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS
ON BUSH'S PLANE IN CARTAGENA.

   IN A STATEMENT BY FOREIGN MINISTER JULIO LONDONO, THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF TERRORIST PLANS AGAINST
THE U.S. PRESIDENT, AND ADDED THAT U.S. AND COLOMBIAN SECURITY
ORGANIZATIONS WERE CAPABLE OF GUARANTEEING THE SAFETY OF THE FOUR
PRESIDENTS.

   THE EXTRADITABLES, A MAFIA GROUP BASED IN MEDELLIN, IN NORTHWEST
COLOMBIAN, HAS BEEN INSISTING SINCE 17 JANUARY THAT THEY WANT A PEACE
DIALOGUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO,
WHO DECLARED WAR ON THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN AUGUST, 1989.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1077 (UNISYS)

BY ABANDONING A SCHOOL BUS LOADED WITH 1,000 KG OF EXPLOSIVES SOUTH OF
MEDELLIN.

   IN TODAY'S COMMUNIQUE, THE EXTRADITABLES DENIED REPORTS THAT THEY
ARE HOLDING [COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL] GARCIA-PENA ARCHILA.
THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE EXTRADITABLES HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF
UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WHO CALLED THE MEDELLIN MEDIA TO SAY THAT THE
EXTRADITABLES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KIDNAPPING.

   THEY SAY THAT AFTER HAVING RELEASED SIX HOSTAGES, THE HOLDING OF
GARCIA-PENA ARCHILA, WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE VISA OFFICE OF THE
COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, IN BOGOTA, "WOULD BE CONTRARY TO OUR PEACE
OFFERS."

   GARCIA-PENA ARCHILA WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED ADVISER TO THE COLOMBIAN
EMBASSY IN KOREA, A POST HE WAS SCHEDULED TO ASSUME FRIDAY, THE DAY HE
DISAPPEARED.

   THE EXTRADITABLES ANNOUNCED IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE OF TODAY THAT
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS THEY WILL DELIVER A HELICOPTER BELONGING TO
THE COLOMBIAN FIRM HELICOL THAT THEY HAD BEEN HOLDING. THE HELICOPTER
IS LOADED WITH 500 KG OF DYNAMITE, THE COMMUNIQUE NOTES.

   THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THIS DYNAMITE "WAS GOING TO BE USED
AGAINST A MILITARY OBJECTIVE."  THE GROUP LED BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
NOTES: "WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE TO

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 JAN 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE NATIONAL POLICE
ANNOUNCED ON 20 JANUARY THAT IT HAS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF THE GUILT OF U.S.
CITIZEN JENNIFER JEAN CASOLO, WHO WAS ARRESTED ON 24 NOVEMBER IN HER HOME IN
THE MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIS CAPITAL, WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS
AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF DOCUMENTS BELONGING TO THE FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT - REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT] WERE FOUND
BURIED IN THE YARD.

   CASOLO WAS ARRAIGNED 8 DAYS [AS PUBLISHED] AFTER HER ARREST, BUT
WAS RELEASED BY THE JUDGE "FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE," ACCORDING TO THE
JUDICIAL RECORDS.

   ALTHOUGH IN SALVADORAN JUDICIAL CIRCLES IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY CASOLO
WAS RELEASED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL FACTORS
INVOLVED.

   AT PRESENT, CASOLO HEADS GROUPS THAT HAVE LAUNCHED A VIRULENT
CAMPAIGN AGAINST EL SALVADOR IN THE UNITED STATES, CLAIMING ALLEGED
"RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION."

   CASOLO WAS CAPTURED AFTER THE TERRORIST FAUSTO GALLARDO VALDEZ GAVE
HER NAME TO THE POLICE, TELLING THEM WHERE TO FIND THE WEAPONS THAT HE
AND HIS ACCOMPLICES USED FOR TERRORIST ACTS.  THE PRISONER SAID THAT
THE WEAPONS WERE PROVIDED BY CASOLO AT HER HOME IN THE MIRALVALLE
NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH SERVED AS A CLANDESTINE ARSENAL.

   IN VIEW OF THIS CONFESSION, THE POLICE REQUESTED THE PARTICIPATION
OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE U.S. EMBASSY, WHO WERE PRESENT IN THE COURSE
OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND WHEN THE WEAPONS WERE DUG UP IN FRONT OF CASOLO
HERSELF.

   WHEN CASOLO RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES, SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE
HAD BURIED DOCUMENTS IN THE YARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE SHE LIVED, BUT SHE
LIED BY SAYING THAT SHE DID THIS BECAUSE "IN EL SALVADOR PEOPLE
COMMONLY BURY DOCUMENTS OR JEWELS TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING STOLEN BY
CRIMINALS."

   SOURCES SAY THAT AT PRESENT, AT THE HEAD OF GROUPS OF COMMUNISTS
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHO SUPPORT THEIR
SALVADORAN COUNTERPARTS, CASOLO HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN TO
DISCREDIT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNRMENT AND TO PRESSURE CONGRESS TO
REDUCE OR ELIMINATE AID TO OUR COUNTRY IN ORDER TO WEAKEN THE COUNTRY
INSTITUTIONALLY AND STRENGTHEN THE FMLN-FDR TERRORIST GROUPS.

   THE POLICE REPORT THAT THE TERRORIST GALLARDO VALDEZ, FROM WHOM
WEAPONS AND AMMOUNITION WERE SEIZED ON 24 NOVEMBER, SAID THAT HE HAD
OBTAINED THE WEAPONS AT THE HOME OF A WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO BE A
FOREIGNER ON BARCELONA AVENUE, MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD, IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   THAT SAME DAY, POLICE INVESTIGATORS LOCATED THE HOUSE, IDENTIFIED
THE PERSON LIVING THERE, AND INVITED U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE SEARCH.

   BURIED AT THE HOUSE THEY FOUND 103 SHELLS FOR 60-MM MORTARS, 213
STICKS OF TNT, 405 ELECTRIC DETONATING CAPS, 150 FEET OF SLOW FUSES,
15 KNIVES, 3 CARTRIDGE CLIPS FOR AK-47 RIFLES, 12,510 AK-47 SHELLS,
9,110 M-16 RIFLE SHELLS, 325 G-3 RIFLE SHELLS, AND DOCUMENTS.

   IN HER UNOFFICIAL STATEMENT, CASOLO SAID THAT SHE DID NOT BELONG TO
ANY SUBVERSIVE GROUP OR ASSOCIATION, AND THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW THE
ARTICLES CAME TO BE IN HER HOUSE.

   ON 5 DECEMBER, CASOLO AND A GROUP OF SALVADORANS WERE ARRAIGNED
BEFORE A MILITARY JUDGE, WHO 5 DAYS LATER RELEASED THEM "FOR LACK OF
EVIDENCE."

   ON 9 DECEMBER, POLICEMEN ARRESTED A WOMAN NAMED RUTH ESPERANZA
AGUILAR MARROQUIN, ALIAS MARINA, WHO WAS FLEEING AFTER HAVING PLACED A
BOMB IN THE ENGINE OF A BUS. ON BEING QUESTIONED, SHE SAID SHE WAS AN
ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY, THAT THE PERSON IN
CHARGE OF LOGISTICS WAS THE AMERICAN, CASOLO, AND THAT SHE HAD
OBTAINED THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL AT CASOLO'S HOME IN MIRALVALLE.

   THE POLICE HAVE DENIED CASOLO'S CHARGES THAT DURING HER DETENTION
SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE, BECAUSE IT
CAN PROVE THAT WHILE CASOLO WAS UNDER ARREST, SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY
AN EMBASSY OFFICIAL, EVEN AT MEALTIME.

   AYACUCHO, 28 JAN 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED
THAT TOMAS EVANGELISTA, A LEADER OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR
REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA) AND DIRECTOR OF THE AYACUCHO DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION, WAS SHOT DEAD BY TERRORISTS HERE TODAY.

   THE POLICE SAID THAT A GROUP OF HOODED INDIVIDUALS EARLY THIS
MORNING ENTERED EVANGELISTA'S HOUSE AND, AFTER TYING THE HANDS OF HIS
WIFE AND FIVE CHILDREN, TOOK EVANGELISTA OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SHOT HIM
AT LEAST 20 TIMES.

   EVANGELISTA, WHO WAS 50 YEARS OLD, HAD HELD THE MOST IMPORTANT
REGIONAL APRA POSTS FOR 30 YEARS.

   EVANGELISTA'S WIFE TOLD THE POLICE THAT BEFORE HER HUSBAND WAS
KILLED, THE HOODED MAN SHOUTED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE PRO-MAOIST
SHINING PATH TERRORIST GROUP.  ANTHROPOLOGIST ABIMAEL GUZMAN, THE
FOUNDER OF THE SHINING PATH TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, WAS EVANGELISTA'S
PROFESSOR AT THE HUAMANGA UNIVERSITY IN AYACUCHO.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE ALSO REPORTED THAT ON 26 JANUARY SHINING
PATH TERRORISTS MURDERED BROTHERS MARTIZA AND JOHN PAOLO PUZO OCHOA
AND THEIR MOTHER MARTA OCHOA IN THE TOWNSHIP OF CAMPINA, 60 KM SOUTH
OF AYACUCHO.

   WITNESSES TOLD THE POLICE THAT THE OCHOAS WERE KILLED BECAUSE THEY
REFUSED TO SUPPLY FOOD AND LODGING TO THE TERRORISTS.

   MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE HAVE DIED SO FAR THIS MONTH OWING TO THE ARMED
STRUGGLE THAT THE SHINING PATH TERRORISTS BEGAN IN 1980 AND THAT HAS
ALREADY CLAIMED THE LIVES OF AT LEAST 17,700 PEOPLE AND CAUSED DAMAGE
OF OVER $16 BILLION, WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT TO THE 70 PERCENT OF THE
PERUVIAN FOREIGN DEBT.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 22 JAN 90 (LA HORA) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO
SAID TODAY THAT "THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES," THUS CONFIRMING
THE STATEMENT GIVEN YESTERDAY, 21 JANUARY, BY ENERGY AND MINES MINISTER RAUL
CASTANEDA.

   THE PRESIDENT ADDED: "WHAT HAPPENED WAS A RESULT OF SPECULATION.
THE GAS STATION OWNERS EXPECTED THE PRICES WOULD INCREASE WHEN THE
QUETZAL'S EXCHANGE RATE CHANGED, BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN."

   HE SAID THAT "THE PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED IN A SHORT TIME BECAUSE
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS TAKEN CHARGE OF THE FOREIGN
EXCHANGE DIFFERENTIAL SO THAT IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE POPULATION."

   REFERRING TO THE WORKERS' DEMANDS FOR A SALARY INCREASE, PRESIDENT
CEREZO SAID THAT "WE ARE FACING PROBLEMS IN GRANTING THE INCREASE
BECAUSE THE 1990 BUDGET HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED."

   CEREZO ADDED: "THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY
CONTACTS WITH THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY
REQUESTING A BUDGET EXTENSION AND GETTING THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO GRANT
A SALARY INCREASE IN THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR."

   PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO WILL PERSONALLY SUPERVISE THE
INVESTIGATING COMMISSION WHICH WAS CREATED LAST WEEK TO SOLVE THE
DOUBLE MURDER PERPETRATED ON 19 JANUARY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH
OF SALVADORAN POLITICAL LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES AND GUATEMALAN
LAWYER HILDA AMPARO FLORES AREVALO.

   THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS PERSONALLY ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENT IN
STATEMENTS HE GAVE TO THE MEDIA THIS MORNING IN ONE OF THE NATIONAL
PALACE HALLWAYS.

   OQUELI COLINDRES WAS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT OF EL SALVADOR AND HE WAS ONE OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL
SECRETARIES FOR LATIN AMERICA.

   THE INVESTIGATION COMMISSION IS COMPRISED OF THREE REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL OF THE NATION, THE HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY, AND THE NATIONAL
POLICE AND TREASURY POLICE DIRECTORS GENERAL.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID: "THE COMMISSION'S TASK IS TO CLEAR ALL
DOUBTS AND PROVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE KIDNAPPING AND SUBSEQUENT ASSASSINATION OF THESE TWO
PERSONS."

   CEREZO REASSERTED THAT "ALL DOUBTS WILL BE CLEARED UP CONCERNING
THIS GRAVE ACT OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO PARTICIPATION
WHATSOEVER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN ELIMINATING ANYONE."

   THE INVESTIGATING COMMISSION HAS IMMEDIATELY BEGUN WORK.  THE
PRESIDENT EMPHASIZED THAT "HE WILL PERSONALLY SUPERVISE THE WORK BEING
CARRIED OUT TO GUARANTEE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S FIRM INTENTION OF
NOT LETTING THIS CRIME, WHICH HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY ALL THE SECTORS OF
THE NATION, GO UNPUNISHED."

   BOGOTA, 30 JAN 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] AT THIS
TIME, THERE IS HEAVY FIGHTING AND EVEN ARMY BOMBING OF FARC [REVOLUTIONARY
ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA] CAMPS NEAR URIBE IN META DEPARTMENT. THE CLASHES
ARE TAKING PLACE IN JARDIN DE LAS PENAS, IN MESETAS MUNICIPALITY, NEAR WHERE
THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FARC SECRETARIAT IS LOCATED.

   THIS REACTION BY THE MILITARY IS IN ANSWER TO A FARC AMBUSH OF A
MILITARY PATROL ON 28 JANUARY, RESULTING IN FIVE SOLDIERS DEAD AND
SEVEN WOUNDED. IN ADDITION, THE ARMY'S INTENSIVE ACTIONS ARE ALSO DUE
TO THE DESIRE TO PUT A STOP TO FARC ATTACKS AND KIDNAPPINGS OF
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LEADERS IN THE AREA.

   LIMA, 30 JAN 90 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [REPORT] [EXCERPTS]
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA HAS CALLED FOR CALM AND SERIOUSNESS IN THE
POLITICAL DEBATES AMONG THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.  HE DESCRIBED ONE
OF THEM AS BEING INTELLECTUALLY IMMATURE IN VIEW OF THE CONSTANT
ATTACKS THE LATTER ALWAYS MAKES.  THE RIGHT, GARCIA SAID, MUST BE
TAUGHT A LESSON OF MATURITY AND SERIOUSNESS.

   THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE FIRST SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL SESSION
WILL BE HELD FROM 5-6 FEBRUARY TO SPECIFICALLY DISCUSS INTERNAL BORDER
DELIMITATIONS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT NO NEW CENTRAL BANK DIRECTOR WILL BE
APPOINTED, WHICH WILL ALLOW THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION TO DO SO.

   FOR THE TIME BEING, THE PRESIDENT ADDED, HE CANNOT EITHER CONFIRM
OR DENY THAT HE WILL ATTEND THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT IN COLOMBIA BECAUSE
THE SITUATION IN PANAMA COULD CHANGE IN THE REMAINING 15 DAYS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, THERE ARE STILL 16 DAYS
UNTIL THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT.  HAVE YOU MADE A FINAL DECISION ON WHETHER
YOU WILL ATTEND OR NOT?

   [GARCIA] NO, I HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION YET BECAUSE PERUVIAN
FOREIGN POLICY FOLLOWS ITS PRINCIPLES, WHILE THE PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC -- DESPITE WHAT SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY -- FOLLOWS HIS, AND THESE
PRINCIPLES ARE LOYAL TO CERTAIN ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS.

   WE ARE YET NOT COMPLETELY SURE THAT THE INVADING COUNTRY, THE
UNITED STATES, IS TOTALLY WILLING TO OR INTENDS TO WITHDRAW ITS
SOLDIERS FROM A SMALL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY.  AS LONG AS THIS DOES
NOT OCCUR, AS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND, IT IS DESPICABLE AND NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SIT DOWN AT A TABLE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS ABUSING A
SMALL COUNTRY WITH HIS ALMIGHTY POSITION.  MANY THINGS CAN HAPPEN IN
15 OR 16 DAYS.

   I AM NOT SAYING EITHER YES OR NO, BUT I THINK THAT THINGS MUST
SOMEHOW CHANGE FOR THE BETTER IN ORDER TO HOLD A CORDIAL MEETING.
UNDER THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE PRESIDENTS
CAN HOLD A CORDIAL MEETING AS LONG AS ONE OF THEM IS PLACING AN ATOMIC
BOMB AND THE THREAT OF INVASION ON THE TABLE.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [GARCIA] YES, I THINK THAT THAT MAGAZINE IS WELL INFORMED, BECAUSE
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS.  AS YOU KNOW, EXPERTS FROM THE
FOUR COUNTRIES MET IN SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA, TO PREPARE A
DOCUMENT.  WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE READY TO SIGN THE FINAL
DOCUMENT, ONE OF THE COUNTRIES PROPOSED SOME MODIFICATIONS CHANGING
THE STRUCTURE OF THE CONCEPT.

   THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS, 4 AND 1/2 YEARS AGO, I
TOLD THE UNITED STATES THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM OF HELICOPTERS OR
BULLETS.  THIS IS A PROBLEM OF BETTER PRICES FOR COCOA, COFFEE, AND
ANNATTO SEEDS.  THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESSING FACTORIES IN THE
HIGHER HUALLAGA VALLEY AREA AND AIRLINES THAT TRANSPORT THESE PRODUCTS
TO THE UNITED STATES.

   THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AFTER 4 AND 1/2 YEARS; WHEN IT WAS
FINALLY ABOUT TO BE PUT DOWN IN THE DOCUMENT IN SANTA CRUZ, ONE OF THE
COUNTRIES MODIFIED IT, THUS HINDERING FURTHER PROGRESS IN THE
NEGOTIATIONS.  THIS SUBJECT IS NOW BEING REVIEWED, AND THE SUMMIT
COULD BE POSTPONED FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL WE REACH FULL AGREEMENT ON
SUCH AN IMPORTANT SUMMIT, WHICH WAS PROPOSED BY THE PERUVIAN
PRESIDENCY.

   WE MUST GATHER AT THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT WITH A CONCRETE PROPOSAL.
IT CANNOT BE SIMPLY A SOCIAL GATHERING.  WE ARE NOT TEENAGERS WHO ARE
ATTENDING THE MEETING SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WILL BE THERE.  WE CANNOT GO THERE AS
DESPERATE AND DAZZLED YOUNGSTERS TO HOLD HIS HAND.  WE MUST MAKE
CONCRETE PROPOSALS TO OBTAIN FUNDS FOR PERU, WORK AND HONOR FOR THE
HUALLAGA VALLEY PEASANTS, AND RESPECT FOR THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY SINCE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE
PROBLEM IS IN THE CONSUMERS OF THE RICH COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE
UNITED STATES.  [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 31 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS TODAY REAFFIRMED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO AGREE ON A DATE TO RESUME
THE DIALOGUE AND THEY PROPOSED A CEASE-FIRE IN EXCHANGE FOR A
SUSPENSION OF U.S. AID.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE FROM THE GENERAL COMMAND, THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) EXPRESSED THE NEED TO "REORIENT" THE
TERMS OF THE DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION SO AS TO TURN THEM INTO A
NATIONAL PROCESS IN WHICH ALL THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL
FORCES CAN PARTICIPATE.

   "WE BELIEVE THE U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS DIRECTED
AGAINST DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT.
THE SUSPENSION OF THAT AID COULD FORM PART OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
THAT WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTAIL A CEASE-FIRE," THE COMMUNIQUE STATED.

   THE FMLN'S MESSAGE COINCIDED WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S
VISIT TO THE UNITED NATIONS, WHERE TODAY HE WILL MEET WITH JAVIER
PEREZ DE CUELLAR TO REQUEST HIS GOOD OFFICES TO ACHIEVE THE RESUMPTION
OF THE TALKS WITH THE REBELS, WHICH HAD BEEN SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER.

   THE GUERRILLAS STATED THAT THEY HOPE THAT CRISTIANI'S MEETING WITH
PEREZ DE CUELLAR WILL LEAD TO SETTING A DATE FOR A FUTURE MEETING.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN RECALLED THE 11 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE AND
WARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S INSISTENCE OF THE GUERRILLAS' ALLEGED
MILITARY WEAKNESS "WILL ONLY LEAD TO GREATER LEVELS OF CONFRONTATION."

   THE GUERRILLAS EXPRESSED THEIR "CONCERN" ABOUT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMY'S REJECTION OF PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S MEDIATION ROLE,
DESCRIBING THE REJECTION AS "AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCEDURE DESIGNED TO
BRING SERIOUSNESS TO THE NEGOTIATING EFFORT."

   "ON OUR PART," THE COMMUNIQUE STATED, "WE ACCEPT THAT MEDIATION AND
WE HAVE MADE EFFORTS TOWARD ACHIEVING IT."

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WANTS PEREZ DE CUELLAR TO PLAY ONLY THE
ROLE OF OBSERVER IN THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.

   SINCE ALFREDO CRISTIANI TOOK OFFICE ON 1 JUNE, THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE FMLN HAVE HELD TWO ROUNDS OF TALKS, THE FIRST IN MEXICO IN
SEPTEMBER AND THE SECOND IN COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER.

   THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS THAT THE FMLN SHOULD GIVE UP ITS WEAPONS
AND JOIN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AS A PARTY.  HOWEVER, THE GUERRILLAS
DEMAND A PURGE OF THE ARMED FORCES AND AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION
IN EXCHANGE FOR A CEASE-FIRE.

[ALFREDO VILLAREAL] COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED
FORCES' JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, TODAY POINTED OUT THAT THE COUNTRY'S
SITUATION DOES NOT WARRANT LIFTING THE CURRENT STATE OF SIEGE.  THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS EXPECTED TO DISCUSS WHETHER TO CONTINUE THIS
MEASURE NEXT WEEK.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] OUR STANCE IS COMPLETELY OFFENSIVE THROUGHOUT
OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY.  WE WILL MAINTAIN THIS POLICY WHETHER THERE IS A
STATE OF SIEGE OR NOT. [END RECORDING]

   THE TOP MILITARY LEADER COMMENTED ON THE DECISION THAT THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY MUST MAKE ON 8 FEBRUARY.  COL PONCE SAID THAT
THIS IS A POLITICAL DECISION AND WHATEVER THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
DECIDES WILL BE RESPECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  HOWEVER, HE NOTED THAT
FULL GUARANTEES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY WOULD BE NONEXISTENT IF THIS
MEASURE IS REPEALED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE WILL RESPECT THE DECISION OF THE
INSTITUTIONS TASKED WITH MAKING THE DECISION.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION
IS NOT YET NORMAL ENOUGH TO WARRANT THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE.
HOWEVER, THE DECISION IS IN THE HANDS OF THE ASSEMBLY OR THE GOVERNMENT.

   [REPORTER] WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS FOR
LIFTING THE STATE OF SIEGE?

   [PONCE] THE PLANS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN].  THE FMLN PLANS TO CONTINUE ITS TERRORIST, SELECTIVE, AND
INDISCRIMINATE ACTIONS, AND ITS ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL AND THE
COUNTRYSIDE.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS.  THE SITUATION
IS NOT YET NORMAL. [END RECORDING]

   AS FOR AN OFFENSIVE THAT THE FMLN HAD PLANNED FOR LAST WEEK, THE
MILITARY LEADER SAID THAT IT WAS FOILED BECAUSE ARMY INTELLIGENCE
DETECTED IT IN TIME.  COL PONCE ADDED THAT THE MOST RECENT GUERRILLA
ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL AIM TO FRIGHTEN CIVILIANS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN IS SEEKING TO MAINTAIN
A PSYCHOLOGY OF FEAR AND COMPLETE INSECURITY AND DISTRUST AMONG THE
POPULATION, BECAUSE THIS WORKS IN THEIR FAVOR.  THEY ARE INVOLVED IN A
PURELY TERRORIST, SELECTIVE, AND INDISCRIMINATE SCHEME.  I HAVE MENTIONED
THE INDISCRIMINATE NATURE BEFORE.  THEIR RECENT ATTACKS ARE SELECTIVE.  THEY
SEEK TO DESTABILIZE THE GOVERNMENT, CREATE DISTRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT, AND
CREATE INSECURITY. [END RECORDING]

   AS FOR THE VICTORIA AND MARTILLO OPERATIONS, COL PONCE SAID THAT
THE FMLN HAD SUSTAINED 2,352 DEAD FROM 11 NOVEMBER 1989 TO 30 JANUARY
1990, AND HE REGRETTED THE DEATH OF 537 ARMY TROOPS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COL GUILLERMO ALFREDO
BENAVIDES, PRIMARY PERSON IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND THEIR TWO EMPLOYEES, WAS OFFICIALLY REMOVED TODAY FROM HIS
POST AS DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY MILITARY SCHOOL.

   BENAVIDES' REPLACEMENT WAS PART OF A HIGH-LEVEL REORGANIZATION IN
THE ARMED FORCES WHICH, ACCORDING TO WESTERN DIPLOMATIC SOURCES,
REFLECTS AN INTENTION TO MAKE GRADUAL CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR,

   BENAVIDES, WHO IS ACCUSED OF HAVING GIVEN THE ORDER TO KILL THE
JESUITS (FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN), WILL BE REPLACED AS
DIRECTOR OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL BY COL RICARDO ALFONSO CASANOVA, WHO
WAS FORMERLY COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, BASED IN THE
EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT.

   COL HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, WHO TO DATE HAS BEEN DIRECTOR OF THE
TREASURY POLICE, WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO USULUTAN, A DEPARTMENT WHERE
GUERRILLAS ARE CONSTANTLY ACTIVE.  HERNANDEZ WILL BE REPLACED BY COL
CIRO LOPEZ ROQUE.

   IN ADDITION TO THE MILITARY SCHOOL AND THE TREASURY POLICE, THE
CHANGES PRIMARILY AFFECT COMMANDERS IN THE AREAS OF PERSISTENT
GUERRILLA ACTIVITY, SUCH AS USULUTAN AND CHALATENANGO, AND THE ARCE
BATTALION, AN ELITE UNIT TO COMBAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN), WHICH IS BASED IN THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF
SAN MIGUEL.

   THESE TRANSFERS AND APPOINTMENTS AFFECT A TOTAL OF 12 COLONELS AND,
ALTHOUGH THE ARMED FORCES DESCRIBED THEM TODAY AS "ROUTINE CHANGES,"
DIPLOMATIC SOURCES FEEL THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO SEEK GREATER
EFFICIENCY IN MILITARY ACTION.  THE SOURCES FEEL THAT MORE CHANGES
WILL BE MADE THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR.

   THE FIRST RESHUFFLING IN THE ARMED FORCES FOR 1990 WAS ANNOUNCED ON
1 JANUARY, THAT IS, SHORTLY AFTER THE FMLN OFFENSIVE, THE SCALE OF
WHICH SURPRISED EVEN THE ARMY ITSELF, AS MILITARY SOURCES ADMITTED.

   ON THAT DATE, GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES AND ONE OF THE OFFICERS MOST OPENLY OPPOSED TO DIALOGUE
WITH THE FMLN, WAS RELIEVED OF HIS DUTIES AND SENT TO EUROPE AS A
MILITARY ATTACHE.

   REPLACED WITH BUSTILLO WERE THE CHIEFS OF THE MILITARY DETACHMENTS
OF CUSCATLAN AND LA UNION, IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE CHIEF OF ARMY INTELLIGENCE.

   CLANDESTINE, 2 FEB 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] [TEXT] THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HEREBY NOTIFIES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF THE FOLLOWING:

   1. WE SEE AS POSITIVE THAT MR CRISTIANI HAS ACCEPTED UN SECRETARY
GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE NEGOTIATION
PROCESS IN EL SALVADOR.  WE FEEL THAT THE MEDIATION OF THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
SERIOUSLY COMMIT BOTH PARTIES TO NEGOTIATION AND OFFER TRUE
POSSIBILITIES SO THAT THE PROCESS WILL LEAD TOWARD A SOLUTION THAT
WILL PUT AN END TO THE WAR IN OUR COUNTRY.

   2. IN VIEW OF THESE POSSIBILITIES, IT IS HIGHLY NEGATIVE THAT THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY
ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE INCREASED IN THE FORTHCOMING
FISCAL PERIODS.  IF THIS DECISION IS RATIFIED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS, IT
WOULD MEAN A DEFINITE DETERMINATION TO PROLONG THE WAR AND THE FAILURE
OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT COULD LEAD TO THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  THE ASSISTANCE STRENGTHENS THE EXTREMISTS.  THE
POLITICAL PRESSURE MAKES IT NECESSARY TO TAKE POLITICAL ACTIONS AND
STRENGTHENS THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION.

   3. THE ARMY CONTINUES TO CARRY OUT PERMANENT MILITARY OFFENSIVES
AND REPRESSION.  THERE CONTINUE TO BE A STATE OF SIEGE, MURDERS,
ARRESTS, AND PERSECUTION AGAINST PEOPLE'S AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS;
THE PRESS CONTINUES TO BE CONTROLLED; AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS
CONTINUE TO BE VIOLATED AS THE EVACUATION OF FMLN WAR CRIPPLES IS NOT
ALLOWED.

   COL PONCE OPENLY PROCLAIMS HIS "VICTORY AND HAMMER" OFFENSIVE
AGAINST FMLN POSITIONS.  THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE, AS THE GOVERNMENT
WANTS THE FMLN TO UNILATERALLY SUSPEND OPERATIONS.  AS LONG AS THERE
ARE REPRESSION AND LARGE MILITARY OFFENSIVES, AND A CEASE-FIRE IS NOT
AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES, WE ARE OBLIGED TO REMAIN AT WAR AND MAKE
OFFENSIVE USE OF OUR MILITARY FORCE IN ANY PART OF THE NATION TO
ACHIEVE SERIOUS NEGOTIATION THAT WILL FIND A JUST SOLUTION TO THE WAR.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 2 FEB 90 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] SOME PEOPLE NAIVELY THINK THAT A COUNTRY CURRY FAVOR WITH THE
U.S. JUST BY BEING DEMOCRATIC. SOME PEOPLE HAVE PLACED THEMSELVES AT
THE SERVICE OF THIS SUPERPOWER, AS LONG AS THE SUPERPOWER HAS HAD NEED
OF THEM.  HOWEVER, ONCE THEY HAVE OUTLIVED THEIR USEFULNESS, NOT ONLY
ARE THEY ABANDONED, BUT NOW THEY ARE EVEN KIDNAPPED, JAILED, AND
SENTENCED.

   THIS HAPPENED TO PEREZ JIMENEZ OF VENEZUELA; LEONIDAS TRUJILLO OF
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, WHO WAS MURDERED BY THE CIA; SOMOZA OF
NICARAGUA; AND LATELY NORIEGA OF PANAMA.

   THESE MEN ARE VALUED ONLY AS LONG AS THEY ARE USEFUL TO THE UNITED
STATES. ONCE THEY ARE NO LONGER USEFUL, THEY ARE NO LONGER REGARDED AS
MEN.  APPARENTLY SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENS WITH COUNTRIES.  IF A
COUNTRY HAS ANY POLITICAL, MILITARY, OR STRATEGIC VALUE, THAT COUNTRY
WILL ENJOY WASHINGTON'S PREFERENCE. HOWEVER, ONCE THE INTEREST NO
LONGER EXISTS, THE AID IS OVER. IF THE INTEREST DECREASES, THE AID
DECRESES.

   HONDURAS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THIS POLICY FOR THE WORLD TO SEE.
THE POINDEXTER TRIAL SHOWED THAT OVER THE SENATE'S OBJECTION, SPECIAL
AID WAS GRANTED TO HONDURAS IN EXCHANGE FOR CONVERTING IT INTO A
LEASED TERRITORY FOR CONTRA OPERATIONS.

   THE YEARS IN WHICH OUR TERRITORY SHAMEFULLY SERVED TO SHED BLOOD IN
ONE OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, ARE YEARS IN WHICH HONDURAS WAS
REGARDED AS A COUNTRY DESERVING MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID.

   WITH THE CHANGE OF U.S. POLICY, AFTER IT ACCEPTED ITS MILITARY
FAILURE AGAINST NICARAGUA, HONDURAS IS NO LONGER THE APPLE OF ITS EYE,
ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES.  THAT IS WHY THE UNITED STATES IS NOT
ONLY GRUDGING ITS AID, BUT IS NOT EVEN GRANTING THE SCANT AID ALREADY
APPROVED, UNLESS HONDURAS AGREES TO ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS.

   THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE.  SINCE THE UNITED STATES IS THE IMF'S MOST
IMPORTANT MEMBER AND SUPPORTER, IT HAS ASKED THE IMF TO TIGHTEN THE
SCREWS ON HONDURAS, AND TO EVEN LET HONDURAS USE UP ITS MEAGER GOLD
RESERVES UNTIL HONDURAS IS FORCED TO SAY, "FORGIVE ME, MASTER."

   AS WE CAN RECALL, WHEN THE GOLD STANDARD WAS ABANDONED FOR THE
DOLLAR STANDARD AND SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS, THE IMF, AND OTHER
MEASURES WERE CREATED, EACH COUNTRY DEPOSITED GOLD RESEVES TO BACK UP
ITS CURRENCY EXCHANGE.  THEREAFTER, ITS MONETARY BACKING WOULD DEPEND
ON ITS RESERVE OF DOLLARS AND OTHER STRONG CURRENCIES.

   THAT IS HOW GETTING FOREIGN RESERVES BECAME THE MAIN CONCERN OF
NATIONS, IF THEY WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE PARITY OF THEIR CURRENCY.

   AS A RESULT OF THE OIL CRISIS, WHICH ON THE ONE HAND SAVED THE
OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES, AND ON THE OTHER HAND DEALT A BLOW TO THE OIL
IMPORTERS, PLUS THE UNCONTROLLED FOREIGN DEBT THAT THE PETRODOLLARS
BOOM BROUGHT WITH IT, THE COUNTRIES WENT TO THE HILT IN DEBT.  AT THE
SAME TIME THEY LOST HUGE SUMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BECAUSE OF
THE DROP IN THE PRICES OF COFFEE, SILVER, TIN, COPPER, AND OTHER
EXPORT PRODUCTS.

   IN SHORT, THE SOURCE OF EXCHANGE DECREASED FOR EVERYONE, EVEN
THOUGH PRODUCTION OF EACH ITEM INCREASED.  DEBTS GREW UNTIL THEY
BECAME NIGHTMARES THAT ABSORBED ALMOST ALL THE COUNTRY'S FOREIGN
INCOME.  THE MONETARY RESERVES THAT WERE BACKING THE CURRENCIES FELL.
THAT IS WHY IN LATIN AMERICA THERE HAS BEEN ONE DEVALUATION AFTER
ANOTHER, COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY.

   IN THE BEGINNING THE IMF USED WHAT WAS CALLED A STAND-BY LOAN, WHICH
HELPED COUNTRIES WHEN THEY RAN SHORT OF RESERVES.  WITH THOSE EMERGENCY
LOANS THEY COULD MAINTAIN THE PARITY OF THEIR CURRENCY, UNTIL THEY COULD
BALANCE THEIR RESERVES.

   HOWEVER, COUNTRIES LIKE HONDURAS, WHICH WERE DEEPLY INDEBTED, BEGAN
TO FILL THEIR LACK OF INTERNATIONAL RESERVES WITH LOANS AND DONATIONS.
EVEN SO THE COUNTRY CONTINUED TO PAY ITS IMPORTS AND EXPENSES IN
FOREIGN EXCHANGE, UNTIL IT REACHED THE CURRENT SITUATION IN WHICH WE
CANNOT PAY THE DEBT. WE ARE OVERDUE $140 MILLION IN PAYMENTS ON OUR
DEBT. OUR CREDIT IS NO LONGER GOOD. THE IMF HAS NO MORE MONEY TO GIVE
TO HONDURAS TO CONTINUE ITS VICIOUS CYCLE OF GETTING INTO DEBT TO PAY
OFF ITS DEBTS.  YET THE UNITED STATES HAS ASKED THE IMF TO TIGHTEN OUR
SCREWS.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 4 FEB 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH NORTH
SANTANDER GOVERNOR EDUARDO ASSAF ELCURE BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER]
[TEXT] [REPORTER] WE ARE SAYING HELLO AT THIS HOUR TO NORTH SANTANDER
GOVERNOR EDUARDO ASSAF ELCURE.  DR ASSAF, GOOD DAY.

   [ASSAF] GOOD MORNING, RCN [STATION CALL SIGN].

   [REPORTER] MR. GOVERNOR, WHAT INFORMATION DOES THE DEPARTMENTAL
ADMINISTRATION HAVE ABOUT EVENTS DEALING WITH PUBLIC ORDER, SUCH AS
REGRETTABLE INCIDENT IN ARBOLEDAS [MURDER OF ARBOLEDAS MAYOR PEDRO
JESUS HERNANDEZ].

   [ASSAF] THE OFFICIAL REPORTS ON THE REGRETTABLE CASE IN ARBOLEDAS
AT NOON TODAY, AND THOSE CARRIED BY RCN AND OTHER STATIONS, DESCRIBING
THE WAY IN WHICH MAYOR PEDRO JESUS HERNANDEZ WAS MURDERED WHILE
INAUGURATING A DINING HALL FOR CHILDREN AT JUAN BUENO, ARBOLEDAS
MUNICIPALITY, LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING EXTREMELY SERIOUS IS
HAPPENING.  HERNANDEZ WAS GOING TO INAUGURATE ON 20-25 FEBRUARY FOUR
OR FIVE WORKS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
COMMUNITIES AND HAD BEEN DEMANDED BY THEM FOR A LONG TIME.  THIS LEADS
US TO BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION IS REALLY DIFFICULT AND THAT OTHER
MEASURES WILL HAVE TO BE ADOPTED TO PREVENT A CONTINUATION OF THESE
REGRETTABLE ACTIONS, WHICH DESTABILIZE PUBLIC ORDER IN THE DEPARTMENT.

   I THINK THAT AFTER THE PEACE TALKS WITH M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] ARE
CONCLUDED NEXT WEEK, DR. OCTAVIO PARDO SHOULD IN SOME WAY PROMOTE A TRUCE
WITH THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY [ELN] AND THE EPL [POPULAR LIBERATION
ARMY] TO SEE IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE AND KEEP THE BLOODSHED
FROM CONTINUING IN OUR COUNTRY, MOST PARTICULARLY IN OUR DEPARTMENT.  OVER
THE COURSE OF A MONTH, TWO MAYORS, WHO WERE CHARACTERIZED AS THE FIGHTINGEST
MAYORS -- IN THE SENSE THAT THEY LAUNCHED, EXECUTED, AND COMPLETED WORKS --
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN OUR DEPARTMENT.

   [REPORTER] MR. GOVERNOR, HOW MANY MAYORS DID YOU SAY HAVE BEEN
KILLED DURING THAT TIME?

   [ASSAF] WHAT DID YOU SAY?

   [REPOERTER] MR. GOVERNOR, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT, FOR INSTANCE, CIVIC
OR POLITICAL LEADERS IN THE AREA OF NORTH SANTANDER CAN PARTICIPATE IN
TALKS WITH THE EPL AND THE ELN TO MAKE SERIOUS PROPOSALS TO THE
GOVERNMENT ABOUT A POSSIBLE TRUCE, AS YOU SUGGEST?

   [ASSAF] IN VIEW OF OUR CURRENT SITUATION, THAT IS, IN VIEW OF THE
FACT THAT A MONTH AGO THE MAYOR OF ABREGO WAS KILLED AND THE ARBOLEDAS
MAYOR WAS KILLED YESTERDAY, I BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY IS PLEASED THAT
THE PACIFICATION PROCESS WITH M-19 WILL END THIS WEEK.  SO, WHY NOT
LOOK FOR AVENUES OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE [1-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] AND THE EPL TO ESTABLISH A TRUCE, AT LEAST DURING THIS
ELECTORAL PERIOD, SO THAT ALL COLOMBIANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF NORTH
SANTANDER, CAN FREELY EXERCISE THEIR SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN
AN ELECTION AND EXPRESS THEIR SATISFACTION WITH OR CONDEMNATION OF THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY GOVERNING THE MUNICIPALITIES?  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1089 (UNISYS)

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [INTERVIEW WITH GARCIA BY UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD THE
OPINION, FOR EXAMPLE, OF THE AGRARIAN BANK, PROBABLY ALSO THAT OF ENCI
[NATIONAL ENTERPRISE FOR INDUSTRIAL MARKETING], CASA, THE CORA PROJECT
[WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE COCA GROWERS ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE A FEW DAYS
AGO STATING THAT THEY ARE NOT AGAINST THE ERADICATION OF COCA
PLANTATIONS BUT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE AGRARIAN BANK'S UNSATISFACTORY
SERVICE IN GRANTING LOANS.  THIS COMMUNIQUE WAS PUBLISHED BY THE MEDIA
A FEW DAYS AGO.

   [GARCIA] YES, WE HEARD ABOUT THIS AND ARE ANALYZING IT.  BUT THE
PROBLEM OF THE 200,000 HECTARES USED FOR ILLEGAL COCA GROWING BY FAR
EXCEEDS THE CAPACITY OF THE AGRARIAN BANK, OF THE NATIONAL COCA LEAF
ENTERPRISE [EMPRESA NACIONAL DE LA COCA], OR THE ENCI TO FINANCE
FERTILIZER.  THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT MUST BE DISCUSSED AT THE
CONTINENTAL LEVEL.  THE HUALLAGA VALLEY IS AN ENCLAVE OF THE U.S.
CONSUMERS.  IT IS A PERVERSE PROBLEM WITH ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS AND
IT IS DISTORTING AND DESTROYING THE POSSIBILITY OF OUR PLANTING OTHER
CROPS IN THAT AREA.  THIS IS WHY WE MUST CONSIDER IT FROM A
CONTINENTAL VIEWPOINT, DISCUSSING IT WITH THE COUNTRY WHERE THE
PROBLEM ORIGINATES, WHERE IT IS CONSUMED.  THE ENCI AND THE AGRARIAN
BANK PROBLEM IS IMPORTANT, BUT IT IS VERY SMALL IN COMPARISON TO THE
SERIOUSNESS OF THE OVERALL PROBLEM.

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, IS IT TRUE -- AS IT WAS SAID IN THE
UNITED STATES -- THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IS REFUSING TO REPLACE
THE PLANTATIONS BECAUSE IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY CONVENIENT?

   [GARCIA] NO, ACCORDING TO SOLID INFORMATION I HAVE AT HAND FROM THE
STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT IN CHARGE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, OUR
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE THE GREATEST EFFORTS DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS TO
ERADICATE COCA PLANTATIONS.  A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY RELEASED A REPORT
TO THE U.S. MEDIA FROM MAY 1989 THAT SHOWED THAT PERU HAD BROKEN ALL
RECORDS FOR ERADICATING COCA IN 1988, IN KEEPING WITH ITS
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.  PERU ERADICATED MORE THAN 5,000 HECTARES OF
COCA PLANTATIONS THAT YEAR, THUS STABILIZING THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF
HECTARES USED FOR COCA GROWING.  NOBODY, MUCH LESS THE UNITED STATES,
CAN SAY THAT PERU HAS DONE NOTHING.

   WE HAVE CARRIED OUT VAST OPERATIONS AND HAVE CONTINUED OUR SILENT
TASK TO ERADICATE THESE PLANTATIONS, SOMETIMES WITH REGRETTABLE
CONSEQUENCES.  THE PEASANT WHO IS FACED WITH BARE LAND AFTER THE COCA
IS UPROOTED EITHER ENGAGES IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OR IS CONDEMNED TO
LIVE IN MISERY.  THIS IS WHY WE NEED AN OVERALL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVE THAT MUST BE PART OF A REEVALUATED LATIN
AMERICAN-U.S. RELATIONSHIP.

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, THE SITUATION IS NOW THE OPPOSITE TO WHAT
THE UNITED STATES IS DOING FOR [WORDS INDISTINCT] A MEETING PUT
FORWARD BY THE PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE THEY GIVE $1 TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING WHILE THERE ARE $100 FOR CONSUMPTION.

   [GARCIA] YOU ARE RIGHT.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TOTAL COST OF
COCAINE SOLD ON THE U.S. STREETS IS $100 BILLION.  ONLY $8 OR $9
MILLION IS BEING OFFERED TO FIGHT THE ILLEGAL PRODUCTION OF COCA AND
 TO REPLACE THE CROPS HERE IN PERU.  WHAT THE UNITED STATES -- THE       
MAIN CONSUMER -- HAS BEEN OFFERING IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE
MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM.

   IF THERE WERE NO CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES, PERU WOULD NOT
PRODUCE COCA LEAVES, EXCEPT FOR THE TRADITIONAL, ANCIENT USES OF
PERUVIAN PEOPLE.  THE PROBLEM BEGINS THERE.  THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
PROVIDING MASSIVE RESOURCES SHOULD BE ASSUMED THROUGH CONCERTED
DIALOGUE, NOT UNILATERAL MEASURES, BECAUSE THERE ARE HAWKS IN THE
UNITED STATES.  THE HAWKS ARE THE BOLDEST MILITARISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT
TROOPS CAN BE SENT TO THE HUALLAGA VALLEY, THUS SOLVING THIS SERIOUS
PROBLEM.

   SUCH AN ACTION WOULD REPRESENT THE VIOLATION OF A NATION'S
SOVEREIGNTY, AN UNWANTED UNILATERAL INTERVENTION.  WE WANT A SERIOUS,
RESPONSIBLE, CONCERTED, FAR-REACHING SOCIOECONOMIC POLICY.  THIS IS
OUR OBJECTIVE FOR CARTAGENA.

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, CHANGING THE SUBJECT, THE ELECTORAL
CAMPAIGN HAS ENTERED THE FINAL STRETCH.  OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE
CONSTANTLY MENTIONED YOUR NAME AND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID OR HAVE NOT
SAID.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE CAMPAIGN?

   [GARCIA] THOSE ARE MINOR SINS BY THE OPPOSITION.  THEY ARE USING
ELEMENTS THAT ARE NOT TOTALLY LEGITIMATE, BUT I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME
PASSING JUDGMENT ON MY DEAR FRIEND ENRIQUE CHIRINO SOTO OR ON ANY OF
THE LAWMAKERS.  I UNDERSTAND THEIR DESIRE AND THEIR NEED TO BE
ELECTED.  OTHERWISE WHAT WOULD THEY DO IN THE FUTURE?  IF THEY WANT TO
USE MY NAME, LET THEM USE IT, EVEN IF IT'S IN A NEGATIVE WAY.  I HAVE
LISTENED TO SO MANY THINGS OVER FOUR AND A HALF YEARS IN OFFICE THAT I
AM ACTUALLY A LITTLE PLEASED BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DESPERATELY
USING MY NAME.  AT LEAST I AM HELPING THEM.

   [REPORTER] SINCE THE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD ON 8 APRIL, WHEN WILL
SCHOOL CLASSES BEGIN?

   [GARCIA] I SAW THAT THE EDUCATION MINISTRY ISSUED A NOTE ANNOUNCING
THAT CLASSES WILL BEGIN ON 1 OR 2 APRIL.  I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE TO
THE EDUCATION MINISTER THAT CLASSES BEGIN AFTER 8 APRIL.  IT WOULD BE
MEANINGLESS TO BEGIN CLASSES AND TO THEN DISCONTINUE THEM IN ORDER TO
OPEN THE SCHOOLS FOR THE ELECTIONS.  CLASSES COULD THEREFORE BEGIN ON
10 APRIL OR WHEN THE MINISTRY DECIDES.  THIS SHOULD BE AFTER 8 APRIL.
WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ALL OF OUR EFFORTS ON OPENING THE VOTING SITES.
I AM ANNOUNCING THAT CLASSES WILL BEGIN AFTER 8 APRIL.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 6 FEB 90 (CNA) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS
ROMERO SAID TUESDAY HONDURAS IS FACING AN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING SITUATION
AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CAN HELP A GREAT DEAL IN SOLVING THE PROBLEMS
CONFRONTING HIS COUNTRY.

   CALLEJAS, INAUGURATED ON JAN. 27, TOLD THE CNA HONDURAS IS FACING A
CRISIS WHICH HIS NEW ADMINISTRATION, WITH HELP AND SUPPORT FROM THE
REPUBLIC OF CHINA, WILL BE ABLE TO TIDE OVER.

   HONDURAS LACKS FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO BUY OIL, MEDICINE AND FOOD FROM
ABROAD.  TEGUCIGALPA'S FOREIGN DEBTS TOTAL WELL OVER U.S.  DLRS
[DOLLARS] 200 MILLION.  "WE ARE FACING A STEEP SHORTAGE OF BASIC
FOODS, CORN IN PARTICULAR," CALLEJAS SAID.

   A POTENTIALLY RICH COUNTRY, HONDURAS CAN OVERCOME ALL ITS DIFFICULT
PROBLEMS AND ACHIEVE PROSPERITY IN THE LONG RUN, BUT IT NEEDS A SHOT
IN THE ARM, CALLEJAS SAID.

   THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA, CALLEJAS APPEALED, CAN EXTEND "SHORT-TERM
BRIDGE LOANS" TO HONDURAS TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF ACUTE SHORTAGE
IN FOOD AND OTHER NECESSITIES.  "A SHORT-TERM CREDIT OF DLRS 5
MILLION, FOR INSTANCE, CAN HELP US MAKE UP FOR THE SHORTAGE AND THEN
WE CAN MOVE AHEAD," CALLEJAS SAID.

   "THE SITUATION IS A CRITICAL ONE," CALLEJAS SAID, "BUT WE WILL BE
ABLE TO COPE WITH IT AND SURGE AHEAD FOR GREATER PROSPERITY, AND WHAT
WE NOW NEED IS A SHORT-TERM HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS IN THE REPUBLIC OF
CHINA."

   HE SAID THE PEOPLE OF HONDURAS HAVE YET TO SENSE THE CRISIS THEY
ARE FACING NOW.  THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, IN PARTICULAR, IS COMPARABLE TO
THE ONE THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA FACED IN AND SHORTLY AFTER 1950.

   "MY ADMINISTRATION KNOWS WHAT SHALL BE DONE," CALLEJAS SAID.  HE
WILL LET THE PEOPLE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CRISIS AND CULTIVATE A SENSE
OF CRISIS THAT IS NEEDED TO RALLY THEMSELVES BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT TO
MOVE FORWARD.

   THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA HAVE SET A "GOOD EXAMPLE" FOR
OTHER NATIONS IN CRISIS TO FOLLOW, CALLEJAS SAID.  "OVER THE PAST 40
YEARS," HE POINTED OUT, "YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATED WHAT CAN BE DONE TO
OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES AND ACHIEVE PROSPERITY."

   ASIDE FROM THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT, THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CAN SEND A
HIGH-LEVEL MISSION TO ADVISE HONDURAS ON HOW TO SOLVE ITS LONG-TERM
FINANCIAL PROBLEM, CALLEJAS SAID.  "YOUR COUNTRY HAS EXPERIENCE IN
THIS FIELD," HE ADDED, "AND WE HOPE WE WILL BENEFIT FROM YOUR
EXPERIENCE."

   ANOTHER FIELD OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS TRADE AND
INVESTMENT, CALLEJAS SAID.  HONDURAS IS SETTING UP AN INDUSTRIAL PARK,
AND INVESTMENT FROM THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS MORE THAN WELCOME, HE
ADDED.

   THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS OPENING ITS MARKET TO FOREIGN IMPORTS, AND
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TAIWAN'S TOBACCO MARKET, IF HONDURAS CAN EARN
IT, "WILL HELP A GREAT DEAL AND START A CHAIN ACTION OF DEVELOPMENT,"
CALLEJAS SAID.  THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GENERATED FROM THE SALES OF
TOBACCO CAN BE USED TO PAY BACK SOME OF TEGUCIGALPA'S FOREIGN DEBT.
THE REPAYMENT WILL EARN MORE INTERNATIONAL CREDIT, WHICH IN TURN
SUPPORTS OTHER PROJECTS OF DEVELOPMENT.

   THE PRESENCE OF A U.N. MILITARY OBSERVER GROUP IN HONDURAS,
CALLEJAS SAID, WILL HELP STABILIZE THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
THE MISSION IS TO HELP EASE THE TENSION ALONG THE BORDERS OF EL
SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, WHICH WAS HEIGHTENED BY GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES.

   CALLEJAS HAS VISITED THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA TWICE BEFORE.  HE TOURED
THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA AS MINISTER OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN 1968 AND
AGAIN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL PARTY IN 1988.

   ASKED IF HE WOULD ATTEND THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION IN TAIPEI ON
MAY 20, CALLEJAS SAID HE WOULD "TRY MY BEST TO GO (TO TAIPEI) MYSELF."
IF HE IS UNABLE TO ATTEND, HE ADDED, HE WILL SEND HIS PRESIDENT OF THE
NATIONAL CONGRESS, RODOLFO IRIAS NAVAS.

   "IF I CANNOT VISIT THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN MAY," CALLEJAS SAID, "I
WILL MAKE A VISIT TO YOUR COUNTRY BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR."  MOST
LIKELY, HE ADDED, HE WILL PAY A STATE VISIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA
IN NOVEMBER.

   IN RETURN, CALLEJAS SAID, "WE WILL BE HONORED TO HAVE YOUR
PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT LI, VISIT US."

   RELATIONS BETWEEN HONDURAS AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ARE "EXTREMELY
CLOSE ONES," CALLEJAS SAID.  "AND WE IN HONDURAS HOPE TO FURTHER
CEMENT THOSE EXTREMELY GOOD RELATIONS," HE POINTED OUT.

   SUCH GOOD RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE MONOPOLIZED BY THE
GOVERNMENTS, CALLEJAS SAID.  "WE NEED MORE CONTACT AMONG THE PEOPLE IN
ALL WALKS OF LIFE, ON CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL LEVELS, SO THAT
WE MAY CONTINUE IMPROVING THE EXTREMELY GOOD RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS
EXISTED BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES," HE POINTED OUT.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 6 FEB 90 (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
THIS MORNING PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HOSTED A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE
PRESIDENT'S PALACE OFFICE.  THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE HUMAN
RIGHTS SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY.  IN ADDITION, [WORDS INDISTINCT]
PRESENTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS RAPPORTEUR OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS
COMMISSION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] [WORDS INDISTINCT] OF THE COMMISSION THAT HAS
ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE ALL MUST ADMIT THAT IN 1989
THERE WAS [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE OF TERRORISM AND
[WORDS INDISTINCT].  ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AND IN SEVERAL CRIMINAL AND
POLITICAL CASES, IT WAS DECIDED THAT [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT CONTINUES
PROGRESSING, BUT THERE IS AN EVEN BETTER WAY YET.  THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER
IS THAT THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE MAKING
MORE PROGRESS EACH DAY AND BECOMING MORE OPERATIONAL.  THE AUTHORITIES ARE
BECOMING MORE COOPERATIVE EVERY DAY WITH THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM FOR LOCATING MISSING
PEOPLE.  WE HAVE FOUND A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO LOCATE MANY MISSING
PEOPLE, AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].  [PASSAGE INDISTINCT].

   FRANKLY SPEAKING, [NAME INDISTINCT] IS A SERIOUS MAN WHO DESERVES
ALL OF MY TRUST AND RESPECT FOR HIS CAPABILITIES.  HE HAS SAID THAT WE
HAVE PROBLEMS IN CONTROLLING SOME TERRORIST GROUPS, AND WHAT WE NEED
IS ASSISTANCE IN IMPROVING OUR EFFICIENCY.  HE HAS POINTED OUT SOME
DEFECTS IN OUR PENAL PROCEDURES WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO KEEP
THESE PEOPLE IN PRISON.

   HOWEVER, HIS CONCLUSIONS DO NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE ARE
GETTING WORSE.  THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THE NEWS.  HIS
CONCLUSIONS NOTES THAT IN SPITE OF THESE OBSERVATIONS THAT HE HAD TO
MAKE AS UNITED NATIONS OBSERVER FOR GUATEMALA, THE SITUATION IN OUR
COUNTRY HAS OBVIOUSLY IMPROVED, COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEARS.  WE
ARE TAKING ALL OF THIS INTO CONSIDERATION.  THIS HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN
A WRITTEN REPORT THAT WILL BE NOTED IN GENEVA IN ORDER TO CONSIDER
TREATMENT FOR GUATEMALA.  [CONTINUED]

   GUATEMALA CITY, 24 JAN 90 (EL GRAFICO) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] A
SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL MISSION, MADE UP OF PROMINENT LEADERS OF THAT
ORGANIZATION, ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY ON 23 JANUARY TO "DEMAND" THAT
THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT CONDUCT AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THE
MURDER OF SALVADORAN OPPOSITION LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES AND
GUATEMALAN GILDA FLORES.  THEIR KIDNAPPING AND SUBSEQUENT MURDER TOOK
PLACE IN OUR COUNTRY AND THUS, GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES, WITHOUT ANY
KIND OF MEDDLING, SHOULD SOLVE THIS CASE.  GUATEMALAN COURTS OF
JUSTICE HAVE THE DUTY TO REQUEST, AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE
TESTIMONIES OF WITNESSES AND CONCLUSIONS OF EXPERTS INVOLVED IN THE
CASE.  ACCORDING TO GUATEMALAN LAW, THERE IS A PERIOD ALLOTTED FOR
INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS DURING WHICH NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS CAN BE MADE
OR PRESSURES EXERTED WHICH MIGHT HAMPER THE COURSE OF JUSTICE.

   THIS IS WHY THE FACT THAT A DELEGATION, WHICH IS MADE UP OF
RESPECTABLE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE OUR ADMIRATION, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF
THEIR OUTSTANDING POLITICAL VIRTUES, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THEIR HONEST
BEHAVIOR AS CITIZENS, IS COMING TO "DEMAND" THAT OUR AUTHORITIES
INVESTIGATE THE CRIME, AS IF THEY WERE NOT ALREADY OFFICIALLY DOING
SO, IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HAMPERING JUSTICE.  IT HAPPENS THAT THE
ILLUSTRIOUS VISITORS CAME HERE WITH THE EVIDENT GOAL OF ACCUSING THE
ALLEGED AUTHORS OF THE DOUBLE CRIME.  IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS, THEY HAVE
ALREADY SAID THAT "FORCES OF THE GUATEMALAN AND SALVADORAN EXTREME
RIGHT" MURDERED THEM.  THESE STATEMENTS ARE AS UNCALLED FOR AS THOSE
UTTERED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IN EL SALVADOR WHEN HE SAID THAT THE
MURDERERS OF THE SIX UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] JESUITS
WERE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
GUERRILLAS AND WAS LATER FORCED TO RETRACT, WHEN THE INVESTIGATIONS
REVEALED THAT MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES CARRIED OUT THE
MURDER.

   IN THE FACE OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, AND THE
COMDEMNATION OF THE BRUTAL MURDER OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADERS,
PRESIDENT CEREZO DECIDED TO ESTABLISH AN INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION TO
WHICH HE PLANS TO ADD A REPRESENTATIVE OF AN INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATION.  ON 23 JANUARY THE SOCIALIST DELEGATE WHO IS IN THE
COUNTRY (WITHOUT NAMING IT) CLEARLY REFERRED TO A LEGALLY REGISTERED
GUATEMALAN POLITICAL PARTY, WHICH ENJOYS FULL POLITICAL RIGHTS, AS THE
"NANNY" PARTY OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, ARENA, OF EL
SALVADOR.  HE IS LEVELLING SERIOUS CHARGES, WHICH COULD EVEN CREATE
LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR, BY
INSISTING THAT THE CRIME WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, WHICH SEEMS TO BE
EVIDENT, AND BY LINKING THE CRIME TO POLITICAL PARTIES OF THE TWO
COUNTRIES.  WITH THE DUE RESPECT THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION
DESERVES, THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE CONSULTED ABOUT WHAT
SHOULD BE DONE NEXT BECAUSE THE CASE IS UNDER THE PURVIEW OF
GUATEMALAN COURTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN JUTIAPA JURISDICTION.  THOSE
COURTS SHOULD BE THE ONES TASKED WITH COLLECTING THE EVIDENCE, ISSUING
THE SUMMONS, AND MAKING THE NECESSARY STATEMENTS.  ANYTHING ELSE
CONSTITUTES INTERFERING WITH JUSTICE.  IN THIS REGARD, THE FACT THAT
PRESIDENT CEREZO IS GUESSING ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE THE AUTHOR OF THIS
REPUDIABLE BLOODY MURDER IS INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT IS NOT HIS DUTY
TO DO SO, EVEN IF THE SOCIALISTS THREATEN TO SEEK CONDEMNATION AGAINST
GUATEMALA AT THE UNITED NATIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH
ARE LOOMING OVER HIS GOVERNMENT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE,
CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, CATEGORICALLY DENIED
TODAY THAT THERE ARE ANY RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN ARMY OFFICERS AND
U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AS ASSERTED THIS WEEK BY THE U.S. MEDIA.

   "I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS.  OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS
ARE NORMAL AS USUAL," PONCE SAID TO JOURNALISTS, ADDING, "THE U.S.
ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE
ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US."

   THE MILITARY OFFICER STATED: "THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO TRY TO
FORCE OR BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES."

   REPORTS FROM THE U.S. CONGRESS SAID THAT THE ARREST OF EIGHT ARMY
MEMBERS LINKED WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO
WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER HAS PROVOKED SERIOUS DISPUTES BETWEEN SOME
MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE U.S. ADVISER CORPS DETACHED TO THE
COUNTRY.

   PONCE PARTICIPATED ON WEDNESDAY, 7 FEBRUARY, IN THE CEREMONY TO
TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL TO COLONEL RICARDO CASANOVA,
REPLACING COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES, ONE OF THE MEN INVOLVED IN THE
ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS.

   PONCE REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY OFFICERS ACCUSED OF THE CRIME ARE
IMPRISONED AT THE NATIONAL POLICE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, BUT THEY ARE
STILL IN ACTIVE SERVICE AND ARE RECEIVING A SALARY WHILE THE COURTS
ISSUE A RULING ON THIS CASE.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 5 FEB 90 (LA PRENSA) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT]
DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS, THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR CONTINUISM,
DANIEL ORTEGA, HAS BEEN INSISTING ON HIS INTENTION OF A QUICK
RECONCILIATION WITH THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.  NEVERTHELESS, HE SAYS SO
AMID SLANDER AND THREATS THAT INVALIDATE THE SINCERITY OF HIS REMARKS.

   FOR ORTEGA AND HIS SPOKESMEN, TO BE RESPECTED BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT AND TO MANAGE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES IS NOW
HIS PARTY'S "BEST GUARANTEE," THAT PARTY'S GREAT ELECTORAL OFFER.  THE
ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THIS INCOHERENT AND CONTRADICTORY
ATTITUDE IS AS A REELECTION STRATEGY, REALIZING THE POPULARITY OF THE
IDEA OF NORMALIZING FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
ORTEGA HAS NOT WANTED TO REMAIN DISTANCED FROM THAT ASPIRATION, WHICH
THE PEOPLE JUDGE AS INDISPENSABLE TO IMPROVE THE CRISIS THEY ARE IN.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT ANY UNNECESSARY DISTANCING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE SANDINISTS WAS DUE TO THE LATTER'S
INITIATIVE.

   EVERYONE KNOWS THE EFFORTS MADE BY BOTH MR BOWDLER AS WELL AS
LAWRENCE PEZULLO TO ATTAIN CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH THE SANDINIST
GOVERNMENT THAT FOLLOWED SOMOZA DEBAYLE'S.  THE STRONG PRESSURES ON
THE DICTATOR TO RESIGN WERE DECISIVE IN HIS DEPARTURE.  THE CARTER
GOVERNMENT'S MASSIVE AND EARLY AID WAS DECISIVE IN STABILIZING THE
REVOLUTIONARY REGIME.

   THE FSLN [SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] NATIONAL
DIRECTORATE, HOWEVER, HAD OTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM HAVANA.  AS SOON AS
THEY GOT OUT OF THE AIRPLANE, THEY TOOK IT OUT ON THE "YANKEES, ENEMY
OF HUMANITY," WHICH WERE ONLY SEEKING AN UNPREJUDICED RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE NEW LEADERS.  THAT RHETORIC WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS OBVIOUS IF
IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT THE TRUE PURPOSE OF THAT CONFRONTATION CAMPAIGN
WAS TO JUSTIFY ITS MISSION OF SETTING CENTRAL AMERICA ON FIRE AND THUS
DISTRACTING THE UNITED STATES WITH A STRATEGY OF DESTABILIZING THE
AREA, WHICH IS CONVENIENT TO USSR INTERESTS.

   THE FMLN'S [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] GENERAL
STAFF MOVED TO NIACARAGUA, AND THE CLANDESTINE RADIO STATION
VENCEREMOS BEGAN BROADCASTING FROM MANAGUA WHILE THE WHOLE COUNTRY
BECAME A SANCTUARY FOR SALVADORAN TERRORISTS AND A LOGISTICS RESUPPLY
BASE.

   THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION MADE ONE LAST EFFORT AT MANZANILLO, BUT
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER TINOCO ONLY WENT TO READ A PREPARED TEXT,
USING THAT BRILLIANT OPPORTUNITY AS A CENTER STAGE FOR PROPAGANDA AND
DISTURBANCE.

   MENAWHILE, THE SLOGAN "IF NICARAGUA WON, SO WILL EL SALVADOR,"
FLOODED RADIO STATIONS, BANNERS, WATCHWORDS, GRAFFITI, AND BOASTFUL
SPEECHES, WHILE THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS MADE EVERY EFFORT TO
OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARY BANDS DID
LIKEWISE, DEVASTATING EL PETEN.

   DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE ENDERS CAME HIMSELF TO HOLD TALKS WITH
THE FSLN'S GENERAL DIRECTORATE, PROPOSING AN ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD
GUARANTEE STABILITY IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR MESSIAH-LIKE PROJECT OF
SUBVERTING THE REGION.

   WHEN THESE TALKS FAILED, WHAT FOLLOWED WAS INEVITABLE AND IS
REGRETTABLE.

   NOW, EVEN THOUGH THE SANDINISTS MAY TRY AFTER 10 YEARS TO MAKE UP
FOR LOST TIME, TRYING TO PUT THINGS RIGHT, THE RECIPE CONTINUES TO BE
THE SAME: ONE, "GENUINELY FREE AND JUST" ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, AND
TWO, THE REMOVAL OF THEIR INCITING HANDS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA.  ON
THESE LINES, SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES BAKER'S DECLARATION LAST WEEK
WAS CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL: CONVINCING PROOF THAT THE ELECTIONS WERE
HONEST, "SOMETHING VERY HARD TO DETERMINE, UNLESS ORTEGA ALLOWS
CONGRESSINAL OBSERVERS," AND CONVICING PROOF THAT NICARAGUA HAS
STOPPED SENDING ARMS TO EL SALVADOR.  IF THE ELECTIONS ARE FRAUDULENT,
SENTENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN PASSED: "THE UNITED STATES COULD MAKE
NICARAGUA'S SITUATION TOUGHER."  IN OTHER WORDS, ORTEGA WOULD CONFIRM
HIMSELF ONLY AS A GUARANTOR OF WAR AND MISERY.

THE LAST CITY HE WILL VISIT DURING THE FIRST PART OF HIS NATIONWIDE
TOUR TO BID TAKE LEAVE OF THE CITIZENRY AS CHIEF OF STATE.  HE ALSO
THANKED THE CHILEAN PEOPLE FOR THEIR HARD WORK TO MAKE PROGRESS.

   THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS PLEASED TO OBSERVE OPTIMISM AMONG THE
PEOPLE IN THE NORTHERN REGION AS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.  PINOCHET
SAID IN COPIAPO THAT THOSE WHO TRY TO TARNISH THE HONOR OF THE ARMED
FORCES AND FORCES OF ORDER ARE AGAINST CHILE.  HE MADE THESE
STATEMENTS DURING A PUBLIC CEREMONY AT THE ALHAMBRA THEATRE IN
COPIAPO, WHERE HE WAS HONORED FOR HIS GOVERNMENT WORK IN THE PAST 16
YEARS.  AFTER ENUMERATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE THIRD REGION, THE
PRESIDENT REFERRED TO HIS COMPLETED MISSION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PINOCHET] WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR MISSION BECAUSE WE
HAVE BEHAVED IN KEEPING WITH THE ARMED FORCES TRADITION.  WE
MAINTAINED THE HONOR WE INHERITED FROM OUR HISTORIC HEROES.  THOSE WHO
IGNORE THE GREAT WORK CARRIED OUT BY THE NATIONAL DEFENSE INSTITUTIONS
ARE BEING IRRESPONSIBLE WITH HISTORY.

   THOSE WHO TRY TO TARNISH THE HONOR OF THE ARMED FORCES AND FORCES
OF ORDER ARE AGAINST CHILE AND ITS ESSENTIAL INSTITUTIONS.  THIS IS
NOT ACCEPTABLE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [APPLAUSE] [END RECORDING]

   BEFORE MEETING WITH THE COPIAPO CITIZENRY, THE PRESIDENT ALSO
REFERRED TO THE VIOLENT ATTACKS THAT TOOK PLACE IN SANTIAGO.  HE SAID
THAT THESE ATTACKS WILL NOT HINDER THE TALKS ON THE TRANSFER OF POWER.
HE ADDED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE FULL REPORTS ON THE SUBVERSIVE ATTACK.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PINOCHET] I THINK IT IS NORMAL, A SITUATION IN
KEEPING WITH THE DYNAMICS OF CURRENT POLITICS.  I DO NOT FORESEE
GREATER CONSEQUENCES TO IT.  WHEN I GET BACK THERE POSSIBLY [PASSAGE
INDISTINCT]

   [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, THERE HAS BEEN A TERRORIST
ATTACK IN THE CAPITAL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

   [PINOCHET] I CANNOT TELL YOU, I HAVE BEEN TOLD OVER THE PHONE, BUT
IT IS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WHICH I CANNOT REPEAT, BUT I DO NOT
THINK IT IS TOO SERIOUS.

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, THAT DOES NOT BREAK AWAY [PASSAGE
INDISTINCT].

   [PINOCHET] ACCORDING TO WHAT I KNOW SO FAR, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED
THAT COULD TURN INTO ANYTHING MORE SERIOUS.  THINGS ARE GOING ALONG
JUST THE SAME, WITH THE SMALL PROBLEMS THAT ARISE DAILY WITHIN THE
DYNAMICS OF POLITICS, BUT AS I JUST SAID, I DO NOT THINK [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, DO YOU THINK THAT THIS ATTACK WAS
COMMITTED BY THOSE WHO ESCAPED FROM THE SANTIAGO PRISON?

   [PINOCHET] THAT IS WHAT I MEAN; I DO NOT THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
SINCE REACTIONS OF VIOLENCE HAVE INCREASED.  IT COULD HAVE BEEN THEM.
ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION I GOT, IT COULD BE SERIOUS BUT NOT AS
MUCH AS TO THINK THAT THIS IS THE END OF THE WORLD. [END RECORDING]

   FINALLY, PRESIDENT PINOCHET SAID HE STILL HAD NO FURTHER REPORTS ON
THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN WHICH ANOTHER CARABINERO WAS SLAIN, AND HE
REGRETTED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI [NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER]
WHICH WAS A SPECIALIZED ORGANIZATION WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE
TERRORIST CELLS.

   THE CHIEF OF STATE WILL END HIS TOUR OF NORTHERN CHILE IN SERENA.
HE WILL RETURN TO SANTIAGO TODAY.

"VICTORIA."

   COL. PONCE SAID THAT THE ARMY HAD DESTROYED 61 CAMPS AND THWARTED
48 LOGISTICAL GUERRILLA OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN JANUARY,
WHILE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SAID IT HAD
INFLICTED 532 ARMY CASUALTIES, INCLUDING 10 OFFICERS, IN ARMED
CONFRONTATIONS DURING THE MONTH.

   COL. PONCE HELD THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE "MURDER"
OF 19 PEOPLE AND ADDED THAT 22 REBELS HAD DESERTED FROM THE FMLN
RANKS.  HE STATED THAT THE REBELS HAD CONDUCTED 235 SABOTAGE
OPERATIONS AGAINST THE TELEPHONE, ENERGY, AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS,
AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIVATE PROPERTY.

   OPERATION "VICTORIA," WHICH BEGAN IN JANUARY, WAS AIMED AT
ATTACKING THE GUERRILLA GROUPS THAT STAYED BEHIND IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF
SAN SALVADOR AND THE COUNTRY'S MAIN CITIES AFTER THE REBEL OFFENSIVE
OF 11 NOVEMBER 1989.

   PONCE SAID THAT 45 PERCENT OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY (APPROXIMATELY
30,000 SOLDIERS) IS PARTICIPATING IN THE NATIONWIDE OPERATION
"VICTORIA."

   THE ARMY CONFISCATED 186 WEAPONS OF VARIOUS CALIBERS DURING THE
CONFRONTATIONS IN JANUARY.

   PONCE ADDED THAT 1,980 PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM YOUTHS, HAVE BEEN
KIDNAPPED BY THE REBELS SINCE 11 NOVEMBER AND ARE RECEIVING GUERRILLA
TRAINING IN CHALATENANGO, MORAZAN, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, IN THE LAST DECADE THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLA MOVEMENT HAS CAUSED ECONOMIC LOSSES TO THE COUNTRY OF
APPROXIMATELY $430 MILLION AS A RESULT OF TELECOMMUNICATION AND ENERGY
SABOTAGE OPERATIONS.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 10 FEB 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTER
JULIO LONDONO PAREDES SAID TODAY THAT IT IS VERY HARD TO THINK OF SOME
IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS "WHEN AT THE SAME TIME THE
INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT COLLAPSES AND TARIFFS AND OBSTACLES ARE
RAISED AGAINST OUR NATIONS' EXPORT PRODUCTS."

   IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE VENEZUELAN DAILY NEWSPAPER
EL NACIONAL, LONDONO NOTED THAT THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT SCHEDULED TO BE
HELD IN CARTAGENA NEXT WEEK IS IMPORTANT IN THAT THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY AND SEVERAL COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE
BEGUN TO REALIZE THAT "THE DRUG PROBLEM IS UNIVERSAL."

   "IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE UNITED STATES, WHICH WAS DECLARING US
SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROBLEMS ONLY FOUR YEARS
AGO, BE REPRESENTED BY ITS PRESIDENT AT A MEETING WITH HIS COLOMBIAN,
PERUVIAN, AND BOLIVIAN COUNTERPARTS, AND THUS PROPERLY ASSUME ITS ROLE
AS COPARTICIPANT AND A PARTY JOINTLY RESPONSIBLE IN THIS MATTER," HE
SAID.

   IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION AS TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE
GOOD-NEIGHBOR COMMITTEES IN HIS COUNTRY AFTER HE STEPS DOWN DUE TO THE
CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION IN COLOMBIA, LONDONO SAID:

   "THE COLOMBIAN COMMISSION -- AND I KNOW THE VENEZUELAN COMMISSION
TOO -- IS MULTIPARTISAN.  I KNOW IT INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE
LIBERAL PARTY AND ITS VARIOUS FACTIONS, FROM THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY,
AND ALSO FROM THE PATRIOTIC UNION.  IT IS A NATIONAL, NOT PARTISAN,
COMMISSION, AND THEREFORE, SINCE WE HAVE PRESENTED SOME ACHIEVEMENTS
TO THE TWO COUNTRIES, I AM CONVINCED THAT THE SAME POLICY WILL
CONTINUE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN WELCOMED BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND
THEIR LEADERS."

   FOR HIS PART, VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTER REINALDO FIGUEREDO
PLANCHART ASSERTED THAT THE PROBLEM OF DELIMITING SEA AND UNDERSEA
AREAS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES, IS
EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA, ALTHOUGH IT MUST NOT BE
FORGOTTEN THAT OTHER VERY IMPORTANT MATTERS ARE ALSO PENDING. "THERE
ARE MANY OTHER THINGS FOR WHICH THE COMMUNITIES AT THE BORDERS WANT
SOLUTIONS, AND THESE ARE THE MATERS WE ARE GOING TO ATTEND TO ON A
PRIORITY BASIS," HE SAID.

   WHEN ASKED IF THE DELIMITATION PROBLEMS WILL BE SOLVED DURING THE
ADMINISTRATIONS OF PRESIDENTS VIRGILIO BARCO (COLOMBIA) AND CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ (VENEZUELA), HE ASSERTED THAT "WE MUST NOT SET FIXED
DEADLINES ON MATTERS."

   THIS WEEK LONDONO AND FIGUEREDO TOURED THE EXTENSIVE FRONTIER
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND DIRECTLY LEARNED ABOUT THE SITUATION AT
THE COLOMBIAN-VENEZUELAN BORDER, WHERE SMUGGLING OF GOODS, DRUG
TRAFFICKING, AND KIDNAPPINGS PROLIFERATE.  


DEV-MUC3-1098 (UNISYS)

   BOGOTA, 11 FEB 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO VARGAS SAID HE WILL ASK U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH -- DURING THE
15 FEBRUARY DRUG SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN CARTAGENA -- FOR GREATER
ASSISTANCE TO BOLIVIA AND PERU, THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PRODUCERS OF COCA
LEAVES.

   DURING AN INFORMAL TALK WITH NEWSMEN, BARCO SAID THAT AT THE SUMMIT
HE WILL ASK PRESIDENT BUSH TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE
TO FIGHT THE "WAR" HE HIMSELF DECLARED ON DRUG- TRAFFICKING MAFIAS
AFTER VARIOUS TERRORIST ACTIONS LAST AUGUST.

   ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SPECIFY THE KIND OF AID OR HOW IT SHOULD BE
PROVIDED, BARCO VARGAS SAID THE ECONOMIC MEASURES HE WILL ASK FOR
WOULD CONCENTRATE ON A GREATER OPENING OF THE U.S. MARKET TO EXPORTS
FROM ANDEAN COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY PRODUCTION AND CHEMICAL PROCESSING
OF COCAINE.

   IN ADDITION TO PRESIDENTS BUSH AND BARCO, BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME
PAZ ZAMORA AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL ALSO ATTEND THE
SUMMIT.  THEY ARE EXPECTED TO PRESENT PROPOSALS ON THE SUBSTITUTION OF
OTHER CROPS FOR COCA LEAVES -- THE BASE FOR MAKING COCAINE -- WHILE
BEARING IN MIND THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF
PEASANTS ENGAGED IN THIS ACTIVITY.

   THE FOUR PRESIDENTS WILL MEET FOR NO LONGER THAN FIVE HOURS AND
WILL SIGN A DOCUMENT IN WHICH THEY WILL DEFINE STRATEGIES TO DEVELOP
AN OVERALL STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL REPORTS, THE POINTS THAT WILL BE INCLUDED
IN THE JOINT DOCUMENT INCLUDE STRENGTHENING ANDEAN ECONOMIES BY
INCREASING EXPORTS, AND THE "TOTAL STRUGGLE" AGAINST INTERNATIONAL
DRUG-TRAFFICKING GANGS BY REDUCING DEMAND, CONSUMPTION, AND SUPPLY OF
HALLUCINOGENIC DRUGS.

   BARCO VARGAS SAID INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS SHOULD "ESPECIALLY HELP
THE FRATERNAL COUNTRIES OF BOLIVIA AND PERU, WHICH HAVE GREAT NEEDS."

   ONE OF THE COLOMBIAN OBJECTIVES AT THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT WILL BE TO
MAKE THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTAND ITS CORESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SERIOUS
COCAINE-TRAFFICKING PROBLEM BECAUSE OF ITS ALMOST 14.5 MILLION DRUG
ADDICTS AND BECAUSE OF ITS SALES OF WEAPONS AND CHEMICAL COMPONENTS --
WHICH SEEM TO HAVE NO OFFICIAL CONTROL -- TO MAFIAS.

   AT LEAST 5,000 MEN FROM COLOMBIAN SECURITY CORPS ARE ALREADY
PATROLLING STRATEGIC SITES IN CARTAGENA TO PREVENT ANY ACT OF
TERRORISM THAT COULD BE PERPETRATED BY THE DRUG CARTELS DURING THE
SUMMIT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE DIRECTOR OF A
SALVADORAN CATHOLIC CHURCH HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP HAS SAID THAT THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE DOES NOT HELP ATTAIN PROGRESS IN HUMAN RIGHTS IN
EL SALVADOR "BECAUSE THE ARMY IS BEING BLACKMAILED WITH MILITARY AID."

   "LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE" DIRECTOR MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ HAS SAID
THAT FOR YEARS THE UNITED STATES HAS SUPPORTED THE THESIS THAT THERE
HAS BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR.

   DURING A MEETING WITH FOREIGN PRESS CORRESPONDENTS HERNANDEZ SAID:
"THAT IS A THESIS BASED ON ITS OWN PREMISES.  IT IS SELF-DECEIVING."

   DURING THE PAST DECADE, THE UNITED STATES HAS PROVIDED $4.5 BILLION
IN ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR, WHICH ALLOWED EL
SALVADOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INCREASE ITS ARMY FROM 12,000 TO
56,000 MEN.

   ACCORDING TO MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ, "THE ARMED FORCES ARE EVEN MORE
ARROGANT AND HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF INDISCRIMINATE ARRESTS"
UNDER THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) GOVERNMENT THAT TOOK
POWER LAST JUNE.

   SHE REPORTED THE REAPPEARANCE OF "DEATH SQUADS," AND MAINTAINED
THAT THOSE GROUPS WERE ALWAYS "INVOLVED" WITH THE MILITARY.

   "THERE HAS NEVER BEEN OR EVER WILL BE A DEATH SQUAD TOTALLY ALIEN
TO THE ARMY, BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN A POWER INDEPENDENT OF THE ARMED
FORCES," HERNANDEZ SAID.

   ACCORDING TO LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE STATISTICS CITED BY MARIA
JULIA HERNANDEZ, 218 PEOPLE WERE REPORTED MISSING IN 1989, AND 31
ASSASSINATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF PROMINENT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS,
WERE BLAMED ON THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT.


DEV-MUC3-1100 (UNISYS)

   CLANDESTINE, 11 FEB 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] [TEXT] TODAY, 11
FEBRUARY, AT 0900, THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE BEGAN BOMBING AND FIRING
ROCKETS AGAINST A SETTLEMENT OF REPATRIATES IN HUANCORA, SAN ISIDRO
LABRADOR JURISDICTION, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, WITH TWO A-37 PLANES
AND FOUR HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS, KILLING SIX PERSONS, WOUNDING THREE
OTHERS, AND DESTROYING SEVERAL HOMES.  IN VIEW OF THESE ACTIONS, THE
FMLN STATES:

   1. WE STRONGLY CONDEMN THIS COWARDLY ATTACK, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT
PURPOSEFULLY BECAUSE THE PLACE IS COMPLETELY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE
AS AN AREA POPULATED BY REPATRIATES.

   2. THIS NEW CRIME DESTROYS THE VAUNTED FALSE IMAGE OF
PROFESSIONALISM BY THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND SHOWS THAT THE
VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS A DAILY PRACTICE IN THE ARMY.

   3. THIS ACTION ALSO SHOWS THE LACK OF WILL ON THE PART OF THE AIR
FORCE TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION [TO THE CONFLICT].  THE
PERSISTENCE OF THESE CRIMES AGAINST DEFENSELESS PEOPLE CONFIRMS THE
NEED FOR US TO REMAIN ARMED AND TO USE OUR MILITARY POWER TO ACHIEVE A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS.

   WE CALL ON ALL HUMANITARIAN AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESENT
THEMSELVES AT THE PLACE TO CONFIRM THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE ACTIONS AND
TO DENOUNCE THEM WITH FULL VIGOR.
