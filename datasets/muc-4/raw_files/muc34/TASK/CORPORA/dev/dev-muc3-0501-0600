   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 22 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [ARTICLE] [PAUL
IREDALE] [TEXT] ACCORDING TO WESTERN DIPLOMATS, COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKERS HAVE MOVED TO GUATEMALA IN SEARCH OF NEW SUPPLY ROUTES,
BRINGING INSTABILITY TO A COUNTRY THAT IS EXPERIENCING A WAVE OF
VIOLENCE FROM VARIOUS SECTORS.

   THE DIPLOMATS BELIEVE THAT UP TO 200 COLOMBIANS LINKED TO THE
MEDELLIN AND CALI CARTELS ARE NOW OPERATING IN GUATEMALA AND THAT
ABOUT 500 KG OF COCAINE PASS EVERY WEEK THROUGH THE COUNTRY,
ESSENTIALLY ENROUTE TO THE U.S. MARKET.

   THE INCREASING DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITY COINCIDES WITH A NEW WAVE
OF KIDNAPPINGS, BOMBINGS, AND MURDERS IN GUATEMALA, AWAKENING FEARS
THAT THE COUNTRY WILL RETURN TO THE VIOLENCE PREVALENT AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE DECADE, WHEN THOUSANDS WERE KILLED BY DEATH SQUADS
DURING MILITARY REGIMES.

   SINCE AUGUST, A PROMINENT POLITICIAN, A WELL-KNOWN BANKER, AND AT
LEAST FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE BEEN MURDERED.  SEVERAL BOMBS HAVE
EXPLODED IN THE CAPITAL IN RECENT MONTHS AND STUDENTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS
ACTIVISTS ARE MISSING.

   "ALL OF THIS VIOLENCE CANNOT BE BLAMED ON A [WORDS INDISTINCT], BUT
THE INCREASE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS CLEARLY AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN."

   IN ADDITION TO THE COCAINE, WHICH THE DIPLOMATS SAY IS TAKEN TO THE
UNITED STATES ABOARD LIGHT PLANES OR IN AUTOMOBILES THROUGH MEXICO AND
TEXAS, U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASE IN OPIUM PRODUCTION IN
GUATEMALA.  ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES, THE NUMBER OF HECTARES PLANTED
WENT FROM 225 IN 1985 TO 1,500 THIS YEAR.

   THERE ARE INSISTENT RUMORS THAT BANKER RAMIRO CASTILLO LOVE WAS
MURDERED OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE ON 25 AUGUST BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO LAUNDER
DRUG MONEY.  THERE IS OPEN TALK IN THE CAPITAL ABOUT IMPORTANT
POLITICIANS BEING LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE DIPLOMATS SAY THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO BACK
SUCH SPECULATION AND THEY ADD THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT SEVERAL
INTERESTS ARE WORKING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY'S FRAGILE DEMOCRACY.

   "IT SEEMS AS IF SEVERAL STRINGS ARE BEING PULLED AT THE SAME TIME,"
A DIPLOMAT SAID.

   WHILE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS GIVEN
GUATEMALA A RESPITE, AFTER DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES DURING WHICH IT
IS BELIEVED THAT MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF
POLITICAL VIOLENCE, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 1,200 LEFTIST
GUERRILLAS ARE STILL FIGHTING IN THE MOUNTAINS.

   FURTHERMORE, THE COUNTRY HAS FACED TWO COUP ATTEMPTS SINCE
DEMOCRACY WAS RESTORED IN 1986.

   THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING, WITH ITS TIES TO THE LAND-OWNING OLIGARCHY,
CONTINUES TO BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE COUNTRY.  IT HAS BLOCKED A
MAJORITY OF REFORMS THAT CEREZO HAS TRIED TO INTRODUCE AND, ACCORDING
TO THE GENERAL CONSENSUS, IT HAS PROMOTED DISCONTENT AMONG THE ARMED
FORCES' MID-LEVEL OFFICERS.

   "THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING IS UNDOUBTEDLY BEHIND PART OF THE VIOLENCE,"
SAID A DIPLOMAT.  "IT COULD BE TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO
OVERREACT OR CAUSE THE ARMY TO GET INVOLVED."

   AS IF TO CONFIRM THIS, A POLICE ARREST WARRANT HAS BEEN ISSUED
AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LIONEL SISNIEGA, A NOTED
POLITICIAN WHO LEANS TO THE RIGHT AND HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN COUP
ATTEMPTS SINCE 1954, ON CHARGES OF HEADING A GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR
MUCH OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY.

   DIPLOMATS HAVE ALSO POINTED TO THE RESURGENCE OF ACTIVITIES BY
LEFT-WING GUERRILLAS WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO TOPPLE SUCCESSIVE
GOVERNMENTS OVER THE PAST 2 DECADES.

   "NOWADAYS THEY ARE USING MUCH MORE OBVIOUS TACTICS, ERECTING
BARRICADES ON HIGHWAYS AND OCCUPYING SMALL TOWNS NEAR THE CAPITAL,"
ONE DIPLOMAT SAID.

   FEAR THAT THE VIOLENCE OF THE SEVENTIES WILL RETURN MAY ALSO
CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A RESURGENCE IN THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
THAT CROSS OVER TO MEXICO.

   MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED CENTRAL
AMERICANS DEPORTED TO GUATEMALA HAS DOUBLED OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.

   THE DIPLOMATS FEEL THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT WILL WEATHER THE
VIOLENCE AND PASS IT ONTO HIS SUCCESSOR AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 1990.

   "PERHAPS THE SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF THE PREPARATION FOR
ELECTIONS IN GUATEMALA," A DIPLOMAT SAID.  "THINGS WILL PROBABLY
WORSEN NEXT YEAR."

   SAN SALVADOR, 22 SEP 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [REPORT] [CARLOS
MARIO MARQUEZ] [TEXT] A FEW MINUTES AGO, DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY
MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED
FORCES ARE WILLING TO STUDY THE POSSIBILITY OF A TROOP REDUCTION IF AN
AGREEMENT IS REACHED WITH THE LEFTIST REBELS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT.  GENERAL LARIOS MADE THESE STATEMENTS TO
FOUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA REPORTERS.  HERE ARE EXCERPTS OF
GENERAL LARIOS' STATEMENTS WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED FORCES
WOULD CONSIDER A REDUCTION IN TROOPS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LARIOS] [IN PROGRESS] ... WHEN IT INVOLVES
DAMAGING THE INSTITUTION -- IN THIS CASE THE ARMED FORCES -- WE MUST
UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE NOT BORN ON A WHIM, OR BY HAPPENSTANCE OR
ACCIDENT.  WE ARE A CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTION AND THE CONSTITUTION
HAS ESTABLISHED CLEAR TASKS FOR US.  THUS, OUR INSTITUTION IS
AUTHENTIC AND LEGAL.

   BECAUSE OF THIS, THE CONCEPT OR CRITERIA OF A REDUCTION IN ARMED
FORCES PERSONNEL CAN BE MANAGED IF IT IS BASED ON VERY PARTICULAR AND
SPECIFIC TERMS.  IF, FOR EXAMPLE, WE REACH A POLITICAL AGREEMENT WITH
THE TERRORIST FORCES FOR THEIR PEACEFUL RETURN TO THE COUNTRY'S
DEMOCRATIC LIFE, THEN THIS WOULD MEAN THE END OF THE ARMED CONFLICT.
IT WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT WE, AS THE COUNTRY'S ARMED FORCES, WOULD HAVE
TO STUDY AND RECONSIDER THE NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THAT WE
PRESENTLY HAVE AVAILABLE TO CONFRONT AN IMPOSED SITUATION, AN
AGGRESSION OF A MARXIST-LENINIST NATURE.  IF AN AGREEMENT IN THIS
SENSE IS REACHED, WE WOULD BE WILLING TO ANALYZE THE INSTITUTION'S
INTERNAL SITUATION TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF HUMAN RESOURCES NEEDED
TO COMPLY WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  [END RECORDING]

   THOSE WERE STATEMENTS BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER AT NOON.  HE
ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED FORCES WOULD BE WILLING TO STUDY A REDUCTION
IN FORCES IF AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND REBEL
COMMISSIONS AT THE MEETING TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, ON 16
AND 17 OCTOBER.  GENERAL LARIOS SAID THAT PEACE WILL BE ATTAINED
BEFORE THE ESTABLISHED DATE IF THE REBELS SHOW THEIR GOOD WILL TO END
THE ARMED CONFLICT IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS WAS LAST MINUTE NEWS.  THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME A DEFENSE MINISTER HAS MADE SUCH AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE
PAST 9 YEARS.

SHAKEN THE COUNTRY.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 18 SEP 89 (PRENSA LIBRE) -- [TEXT] ARMY SPOKESMAN
COLONEL LUIS ARTURO ISAACS HAS SAID THAT POSSESSION OF WAR MATERIEL
DESIGNATED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE MILITARY MAKES LIONEL SISNIEGA
OTERO A TERRORIST.  HOWEVER, COL ISAAC DID NOT CONFIRM WHETHER
SISNIEGA WAS INVOLVED IN THE TERRORIST ATTACK THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN
THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

   INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS LIONEL SISNIEGA OTERO WH
SUPPLIED THE GRENADES TO THOSE WHO ARE NOW UNDER ARREST. ONCE
ARRESTED, SISNIEGA WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THE COURT WHY HE HAD THE
WEAPONS, COL ISAACS ADDED.

   COL ISAACS CONFIRMED THAT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE IS INVESTIGATING
HOW AND FROM WHERE SISNIEGA OTERO OBTAINED THE WAR MATERIEL.

   THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID THE POSSESSION OF WAR MATERIEL BY
CIVILIANS IS PROHIBITED AND PUNISHABLE BY LAW. IN THIS RESPECT,
CIVILIAN PROTECTION SYSTEM AUTHORITIES SHOULD DEEPEN THEIR
INVESTIGATIONS AND THE COURTS SHOULD BE STRICTER.

   ASKED ABOUT THE SURPRISING AND SUDDEN MANNER IN WHICH CAPTAIN
LIONEL SISNIEGA CORDERO, SON OF SISNIEGA OTERO, WAS SENT OUT OF THE
COUNTRY, COL ISAACS SAID THAT IT HAD BEEN DONE FOR HIS PERSONAL
SAFETY, SINCE ANY EXTREMIST FACTION COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
SITUATION TO TRY TO HARM HIM.

   ISAACS CONFIRMED THAT CAPT SISNIEGA OTERO WAS APPOINTED MILITARY
ATTACHE AT THE GUATEMALAN EMBASSY IN VENEZUELA AND THAT FILLING THIS
POSITION IS PART OF THE SOLDIER'S DUTY.

   WHEN ASKED WHETHER CAPT SISNIEGA CORDERO COULD HAVE SUPPLIED THE
WEAPONS TO HIS FATHER, COL ISAACS REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY, ADDING
THAT EVERY OFFICER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL THAT KEEPING WAR MATERIEL AT
HOME IS FORBIDDEN AND IN VIOLATION OF ARMED FORCES DIRECTIVES.

   POSSESSION OF WEAPONS IS A MISDEMEANOR AND NOT A FELONY, COL ISAAC
SAID.  AS AN EXAMPLE, HE SAID HE HAS A "GALIL" WHICH HE KEEPS AT HIS
OFFICE, ALTHOUGH HE CARRIES HIS HANDGUN WHEREVER HE GOES.

   HOWEVER, HE SAID THE POSSIBILITY IS BEING INVESTIGATED, ALTHOUGH H
CONSIDERS IT FAR-FETCHED. AS A RULE THE ARMY PROTECTS ITS MEMBERS, AN
THIS IS PRECISELY WHY CAPT SISNIEGA CORDERO WAS GIVEN DIPLOMATIC
STATUS AND SENT TO VENEZUELA.

   ON ANOTHER SUBJECT, COL ISAACS SAID HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF A
GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE ACATENENGO DETACHMENT, POINTING OUT THAT THE
GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG) MAKES FALSE CLAIMS THAT
DO NOT CORRESPOND WITH REALITY.

   THERE HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT RUMORS OF A RECENT SUBVERSIVE GROUP
ATTACK ON THE ACATENANGO DETACHMENT DURING WHICH MANY CASUALTIES WERE
INFLICTED.

   IN THE FIRST ATTACK, A 5-KG DYNAMITE CHARGE EXPLODED IN A BRANCH OF

   A SECURITY GUARD WAS INJURED BY THE SHATTERED GLASS CAUSED BY THE
IMPACT OF THE EXPLOSION.

   ALTHOUGH THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE WAS NOT SERIOUSLY DAMAGED, SOME 10
HOMES NEARBY WERE.

   THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF EL ESPECTADOR, A NEWSPAPER WHICH HAS
MAINTAINED A HARDLINE POSITION ON DRUG TRAFFICKING AND WHOSE DIRECTOR
WAS ASSASSINATED IN DECEMBER 1986, WAS THE TARGET OF A VIOLENT CAR
BOMB ATTACK 20 DAYS AGO.

   IN ANOTHER TERRORIST ACTION, SEVERAL MEN IN A VEHICLE OPENED FIRE
ON THE OFFICES OF THE NEWSPAPER EL SIGLO, BUT NOBODY WAS INJURED.

   THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK OF THIS KIND AGAINST THE NEWSPAPER IN THE

   SINCE MONDAY, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED PRESENCE OF UNIFORMED

KNIGHT HAD CONFIRMED THAT THREATS HAD BEEN MADE AGAINST THE EMBASSY
AND THAT THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN PUT IN PLACE.  HE SAID
THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ALARM.  KNIGHT SAID THAT THE EMBASSY HAD
RECEIVED A THREATENING NOTE AND THAT THE MINISTRY HAD ALSO RECEIVED
ONE THROUGH A "CHANNEL", BUT GAVE NO DETAILS.

   SINCE TAKING OFFICE, THE MANLEY GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS FIRM
COMMITMENT TO STAMP OUT DRUG ABUSE AND DRUG TRAFFICKING.  JAMAICA IS
SAID TO BE A TRANSSHIPMENT POINT FOR DRUGS SHIPPED FROM SOME LATIN
AMERICAN COUNTRIES TO THE UNITED STATES.

   THE NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER, HOWEVER, SAID THAT FROM ALL
INDICATIONS THE ACTION WAS A "TOTALLY INTERNAL ONE" AND THERE WAS NO
OBVIOUS CONNECTIONS WITH THE DRUG WAR BETWEEN THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT
AND THE MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL.  "WE ARE LOOKING AT THE MATTER WITH ALL
SERIOUSNESS, BUT PRESENT INDICATIONS SHOW THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO BE

   GUATEMALA CITY, 22 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A HIGH-RANKING MILITARY
SOURCE CLOSE TO VINICIO CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT SUGGESTED TODAY THAT "THE

CONDUCTED TWO FAILED COUPS IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF, MAY BE
INVOLVED IN THE WAVE OF TERRORIST EXPLOSIONS, ABDUCTIONS, AND
POLITICAL MURDERS THAT HAS BEEN SCOURGING GUATEMALA OVER THE LAST 2
MONTHS.

   THE MILITARY SOURCE, WHO MADE STATEMENTS TO AFP ON THE CONDITION
THAT HIS IDENTITY WAS NOT REVEALED, SAID THAT "THOSE GENTLEMEN (ODEM)
HAVE BECOME THE NUMBER ONE ENEMY" OF CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT.

   THE SOURCE ADDED THAT "THE COUNTRY IS AGAIN FACING CERTAIN THREATS,
INCLUDING THAT OF THOSE GENTLEMEN."

   THUS FAR, NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE WHO THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION
ARE, ALTHOUGH SOME MEDIA SOURECES CLAIM THEY ARE "VERY POWERFUL AND
WELL ORGANIZED."

   AMID THE TERRORIST ACTIVITY THAT HAS BEEN SHAKING GUATEMALA OVER
THE LAST 2 MONTHS, "ODEM" HAS BEEN MARKING ITS INCREASING PRESENCE
THROUGH FREQUENT COMMUNIQUES RELEASED CLANDESTINELY IN GUATEMALA CITY.
IN THE COMMUNIQUES, IT LAUNCHES HARSH ATTACKS ON THE CURRENT
GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT.

   IN ONE OF THEIR MOST RECENT COMMUNIQUES, WHICH THEY CIRCULATED IN
GUATEMALA CITY LAST WEEK, THE REBEL MILITARY MEN SAY: "WE WILL NOT
STOP UNTIL WE CHANGE THIS SYSTEM OF ANARCHY, CORRUPTION, AND DRUG
TRAFFICKING.

   ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL ARMY SPOKESMAN, THE SEDITIOUS MILITARYMEN
"ARE OFFICERS WHO WERE REMOVED FROM POWER IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND
LOST ALL THEIR LEADERSHIP IN THE BARRACKS.  THEIR RESENTMENT IS BEING
MANIPULATED BY POLITICAL, CONSERVATIVE FORCES.

   "THEY ARE MANIPULATED BY PEOPLE OF THE EXTREME RIGHT, IN OTHER
WORDS, BY POLITICAL CRIMINALS WHO WANT TO RETURN TO POWER TO REGAIN
THEIR PAST PRIVILEGES." THIS WAS STATED TODAY BY ONE OF THE MILITRAY
OFFICERS WHO LINKED THE THE ODEM TO THE ESCALATION OF TERRORISM IN THE
COUNTRY.

   THE SAME SOURCE ADMITTED THAT THE SUSPECTED MILITARY TERRORISTS
COULD HAVE "SUPPORTERS" WITHIN THE ARMY, BUT ADDED THAT "THE UNITY" OF
THE GUATEMALAN ARMED FORCES IS NOT THREATENED BY THEM.

   IN THEIR FREQUENT COMMUNIQUES, ODEM IDENTIFIES ITSELF AS "PATRIOTS
WHO OPPOSE THE COMMUNIST AND CORRUPT SYSTEM THEY [NOT FURTHER
IDENTIFIED] WANT TO IMPOSE ON US THROUGH THE CURRENT POLICY
IMPLEMENTED BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CLIQUE IN POWER."

A HARSH BLOW TO DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT CAPTURED JUAN HERNANDO
GONZALEZ AND GERMAN BELANDRIA, TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO WORKED FOR THE
COLOMBIAN CARTELS.

   ACTING GOVERNMENT MINISTER LUIS FELIX LOPEZ SAID THE TWO COLOMBIANS
WERE ARRESTED IN TAISHA, IN THE CENTRAL EASTERN REGION, WHEN THEIR
AIRPLANE VIOLATED ECUADOR'S AIR SPACE.

   THE AIRPLANE, A LUXURY CESSNA 210 TWIN-MOTOR AIRCRAFT WITH A
COLOMBIAN REGISTRATION, WAS FORCED TO LAND BY THE ECUADORAN ARMED
FORCES.

   ACCORDING TO ECUADOR RADIO, THE AIRCRAFT MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING
IN THE AREA OF BUFFO IN PASTAZA PROVINCE.  THE RADIO ADDED THAT THE
AIRPLANE, NAMED CENTURION, IS WHITE AND HAS THE REGISTRATION NUMBER
H-K-27-29.

   ONCE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE ARRESTED THEY WERE BROUGHT TO QUITO
AND DEPORTED TO COLOMBIA, WHERE THEY WILL BE TRIED.

   ACTING MINISTER LOPEZ SAID THAT THE EVENT OCCURRED IN TAISHA AT
1000 ON 14 SEPTEMBER.  THE AIRCRAFT, WHICH WAS FLYING OVER ECUADORAN
TERRITORY TOWARD AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION, IS NOW IN CUSTODY OF THE
ECUADORAN ARMED FORCES AT THE TAISHA AIRPORT.

   THE TWO TRAFFICKERS HAD $336,000 IN THEIR POSSESSION.

   LOPEZ SAID THAT THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO STOP THE
INFILTRATION OF FOREIGNERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVED IN DRUG
TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES.

   THE ARREST OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WAS COORDINATED BY THE MINISTRY
OF DEFENSE AND THE POLICE.

   GONZALEZ AND BELANDRIA ARE PRESUMABLY LINKED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING
ACTIVITIES, GIVEN THE LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CARRIED AND THE FACT
THAT THEY WERE CLANDESTINELY FLYING OVER ECUADORAN TERRITORY.

   IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS COVERING THE CALI-PUERTO

TWO POSITIONS AT THE SENATE: THOSE WHO ADVOCATED THAT THE AID BE
DIVIDED IN THREE PACKAGES TO CONTINUE THE DELIVERY OF THE LAST PORTION
OF THE AID TO THE GOVERNMENT AMID THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, AND THOSE WHO
WANTED TO GIVE UNCONDITIONAL AID TO CRISTIANI, A POSITION BASICALLY
DEFENDED BY CHRISTOPHER DODD.  SENATOR DODD HIMSELF SAID THIS AID IS

PROMOTE THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR.  THIS IS NOT A SIGN FOR THE

   THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS TAKEN
UNMISTAKABLE STEPS THAT EXPRESS ITS WILLINGNESS TO HELP ATTAIN PEACE.
HOWEVER, IT SEEMS THE U.S. SENATORS ARE MISINFORMED ABOUT EVENTS IN EL

BOMBINGS, THE WAR PARADES, AND THE HARASSMENT OF THE PRESS.  IN SUM,
THESE ARE WAR ACTIONS AMID A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR

THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAVE MADE PROMISES THAT THEY NEVER KEPT.  THE
ARMED FORCES ARE A PERMANENT INSTITUTION AND THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY
SUFFERED THE NONCOMPLIANCE OF AGREEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE BY THE
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT WITH THE FMLN.  NOW, THE LACK OF TRUST MUST BE
OVERCOME WITH SPECIFIC ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE.  HERE, WE HAVE SOMETHING
THAT MUST BE CLEARLY APPRECIATED.  THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT;
THEY ARE AN INSTITUTION.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS THE GENERAL COMMANDER
OF THE ARMED FORCES.  THUS, THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION IS ALSO
INCLUDED IN PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S STATEMENTS. [END RECORDING]

   ACCORDING TO MERINO, COMMENTARIES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY SEVERAL
MILITARY COMMANDERS ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS COMMENTARIES OUTSIDE ANY
AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY REACH WITH THE REBELS.  ON THE SAME
SUBJECT, THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO COMMENTED THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR
THE GUERRILLAS TO CHANGE THEIR MILITARY BEHAVIOR, AS THEY HAVE TO SHOW
THAT THEY REALLY WANT TO START A PROGRESSIVE WAR DE-ESCALATION
PROCESS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE EFFECTIVENESS AND TOTALITY WITH WHICH
THE FMLN STOPS HOSTILITIES; CEASES ITS ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST
ELECTRICITY, COMMUNICATIONS, AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES; AND
STOPS THE USE OF MINES WILL DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMY'S OFFENSIVE ACTIONS.  THIS IS LOGICAL, AS WHEN THERE IS NO
AGGRESSION, THERE CAN BE NO ACTION TO COUNTER IT. [END RECORDING]

   MERINO SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT FOR
THE FMLN TO DRASTICALLY DECREASE STREET VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR, SUCH
AS THE VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY MASS ORGANIZATIONS RECENTLY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] HOSTILITIES ARE NOT ONLY THOSE ACTIONS
THAT INCLUDE THE USE OF MILTARY FORCE, SUCH AS MINES, BOMBS, AND SO
ON.  THEY ALSO INCLUDE FMLN MASS ORGANIZATION ACTIONS THAT ARE CARRIED
OUT MAINLY IN SAN SALVADOR AND ARE CREATING A CERTAIN DEGREE OF
DESTABILIZATION.  IT IS A KIND OF URBAN TERRORISM, AS THESE GROUPS ARE
DISTORTING THE RIGHT TO PROTEST OR THE RIGHT OF EXPRESSION.  THESE
ORGANIZATIONS ARE NO LONGER ONLY CARRYING A MESSAGE, BUT HAVE STARTED
TO DESTROY AND DAMAGE PRIVATE PROPERTY AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, AND
THREATEN THE CITIZENS' INTEGRITY.  THUS, YOU SEE HERE A DIRECT
RELATIONSHIP WHICH DEMANDS THAT THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS AND
CEASEFIRE MUST INCLUDE URBAN ACTIONS, AS WELL.  A CEASEFIRE MUST ALSO
INCLUDE THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT CARRY OUT OFFENSIVE ACTIONS OR ACTIONS
BY FACADE GROUPS IN THE CITIES THAT PROMOTE STREET DISORDER.  [END
RECORDING]

   DURING PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S 15-DAY-ABSENCE, MERINO REPORTED THAT
HE WILL WORK ON THE PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL PRESENT TO THE
FMLN IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA ON 16 OCTOBER, WITH AN ADVISORY
COMMISSION FORMED BY MILITARY OFFICERS, PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN,
INTELLECTUALS, AND POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 24 SEP 89 (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT]
GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER MARIO PALENCIA WAS ASKED TODAY ABOUT THE
CASE OF THE GUATEMALANS WHO TRAVELLED TO SPAIN.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PALENCIA] I HAVE NO INFORMATION, THEY DID NOT
[WORD INDISTINCT] THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. I HAVE RECEIVED NO OFFICIAL
INFORMATION CONCERNING THOSE PEOPLE.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU HAVE ANY OFFICIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE
THREE STUDENTS WHO LEFT FOR PANAMA?

   [PALENCIA] NO, I HAVE NOT BEEN INFORMED ABOUT THEM EITHER.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU BELIEVE THEY LEFT THROUGH THE NORMAL CHANNELS?

   [PALENCIA] THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS NOT CARRIED OUT ANY SPECIAL
PROCEDURE. [END RECORDING]

   THE DEPARTURE OF TWO STUDENT LEADERS WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN
SUBJECTED TO PERSECUTION AND THREATS CAME LESS THAN 2 WEEKS AFTER THE
DEATH OF FOUR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED, AND
COINCIDED WITH THE PRESENCE IN GUATEMALA OF UN OBSERVER PETER
KOOIJMANS, A SPECIALIST IN TORTURE ANALYSIS, WHO MAY REMAIN IN THE
COUNTRY FOR 6 DAYS.

   FOREIGN MINISTER MARIO PALENCIA ADMITTED THAT THE ESCALATION OF
VIOLENCE IN GUATEMALA OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, RELATED SITUATIONS SUCH
AS THE FLIGHT OF GUATEMALANS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, AND THE
REESTABLISHMENT OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TRAVEL ADVISORY, HAVE AFFECTED
GUATEMALA'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT
LED TO THE ATMOSPHERE OF UNREST IN THE COUNTRY HAVE NORMALIZED
SOMEWHAT.

   CLANDESTINE, 26 SEP 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] JUST
10 DAYS AFTER A DIALOGUE WAS HELD IN MEXICO, THE SITUATION HAS BECOME
MORE TENSE IN VIEW OF THE GOVERNMENTS AND ARMED FORCE'S ATTITUDE.  THE
GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] HEREBY ANNOUNCES THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE FMLN HAS SHOWN ITS WILLINGNESS AND FLEXIBILITY BY CARRYING
OUT UNILATERAL ACTIONS, AND PRESENTING A REALITISTIC PEACE PROPOSAL
THAT COVERS THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE ENTIRE NATION IN ENDING THE
CONFLICT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

   2.  ON THE CONTRARY, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT
MADE ANY EFFORTS, BUT RATHER THEY HAVE HARDENED THEIR STANDS AND
CARRIED OUT REPRESSIVE ACTIONS.  IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, WHILE WE
OFFERED A UNILATERAL TRUCE, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE
CONDUCTED PROVOKING WAR ACTIONS; LAUNCHED MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE
AREAS UNDER GUERRILLA CONTROL; BOMBED CIVILIAN POPULATIONS IN MORAZAN,
CHALATENANGO, AND GUAZAPA; MAINTAINED A MILITARY SEIGE ON THE
UNIVERSITY AND TRADE UNION BUILDINGS; AND EVICTED PEASANTS AND TENANTS
FROM THEIR LANDS.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN
UNLEASHING A MERCILESS REPRESSION AGAINST THE ORGANIZATION OF THE
PEOPLE, TRADE UNIONS, PEASANTS, RELIGIOUS GROUPS, AND STUDENTS.  THE
NATION HAS BEEN SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT OVER 400 PEOPLE WERE CAPTURED IN
THE LAST MONTH.

   DOZENS OF PEOPLE ARE MISSING OR DEAD.  THE FASCIST BRUTAL
GOVERNMENT IS NOT ASHAMED TO EXHIBIT UNDIGNIFIED PICTURES OF TRADE
UNION LEADERS -- WHO SHOW SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN TORTURED -- TESTIFYING
BEFORE JUDGES.  THE GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY SHOWS THE HORROR OF WOMEN WHO
HAVE BEEN RAPED IN THE PRISONS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, THE OUTRAGES
COMMITTED AGAINST THE BAPTIST CHURCH, AND THE BEATINGS AND THREATS
AGAINST NEWSMEN.  THE GOVERNMENT EXHIBITS TERRIFYING PHOTOGRAPHS IN
THE NEWSPAPERS OF WORKERS TIED BY THEIR THUMBS, AND BLINDFOLDED IN THE
MOST REPULSIVE STYLES OF THE DEATH SQUADS.

   WE HAVE REACHED SUCH A STATE OF PROVOCATION THAT VICE PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO MERINO IS TRYING TO HUMILIATE PUBLICLY THE PEOPLE'S SECTORS
BY CALLING THEM TRASH.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT EVEN TRIED TO SOLVE THE
CASE OF THE WAR HANDICAPPED; THERE ARE 45 OF THEM OCCUPYING THE
METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL.  THE ONLY ANSWER TO THEIR DEMANDS FOR MEDICAL
ATTENTION ABROAD IS THE RIOT POLICEMEN THAT HAVE BEEN SENT TO THREATEN
ATTACKING [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO ACHIEVE THE FREEDOM OF 11 INNOCENT
YOUTHS WHO WERE CAPTURED AT A LOCAL CLINIC.  TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS APPROVED SENDING $90 MILLION TO THE FASCIST
GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE FINANCING THE WAR AND REPRESSION.

   3.  THIS STATE OF REPRESSION AND THIS MOCKERY TO THE LEGITIMATE
ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE FOR PEACE IS UNACCEPTABLE.  THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE SAY: NO MORE CAPTURES, TORTURE, MURDERS, BOMBINGS, SIEGES,
EVICTIONS, OR HUMILIATION!

   TO OUR FRIENDS AND ENEMIES, WE SAY THAT JUST LIKE WE REMAIN
FLEXIBLE AND OPEN FOR NEGOTIATIONS, WE WILL LIKEWISE BE WILLING, ABLE,
AND READY TO ACCOMPANY THE PEOPLE IN THEIR STRUGGLE AND STRONGLY CARRY
THE FLAG OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE TO ADVANCE UNTIL WE HAVE NAILED THAT
FLAG INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ONLY WANT WAR.

   THIS GENERAL COMMAND HEREBY ORDERS ALL OUR GROUPS, FIGHTERS,
MILITIA MEMBERS, AND COLLABORATORS TO DEFEND WITH HONOR AND STRENGTH
AND WITH THEIR WEAPONS THE FLAG OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE THAT THE ENTIRE
NATION DEMANDS.

   WE HEREBY NOTIFY THAT TODAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 1989, OUR FORCES HAVE
BEGUN A NATIONAL MANEUVER THAT WE CALL "STOP THE REPRESSION, EVERYONE
FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE." OUR MANEUVER CALLS FOR
ATTACKING SEVERAL GARRISONS AND STRATEGIC POSITIONS OF THE ARMY IN THE
FOUR REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.  WE WILL CONTINUE REPORTING ON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIONS IN THE FOUR WAR FRONTS IN A FORTHCOMING
COMMUNIQUE.

   AGAINST REPRESSION, EVERYONE FOR ACHIEVING DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 SEP 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF NOT WANTING TO NEGOTIATE THE END
OF THE WAR AND INCREASING THE "REPRESSION" AGAINST WORKERS.

   IN A LETTER DISCLOSED ON MONDAY, 25 SEPTEMBER, AND SENT TO THE
UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE FOREIGN MINISTRIES OF EUROPE AND THE
AMERICAS, THE REBELS SAY THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI
AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES "ARE MAINTAINING THEIR INFLEXIBILITY,
USING THE CONSTITUTION AS AN EXCUSE."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IS WARNING
THAT THERE ARE TWO STANCES IN THE FACE OF THE DIALOGUE: ONE IS OF
"FLEXIBILITY AND GOODWILL," AND THE OTHER, OF "INFLEXIBILITY AND
PROVOCATION THAT USES THE DIALOGUE TO ESCALATE THE WAR AND
REPRESSION."

   IN ITS LETTER, THE FMLN GAVE A RUNDOWN OF ITS BIDS TO "PROMOTE A
DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION" WITH THE GOVERNMENT, MENTIONING ITS UNILATERAL
TRUCE AND DECISION TO STOP SABOTAGING THE ELECTRICITY AND TELEPHONE
NETWORKS AND USING MINES.

   IN ADDITION, THE GROUP NOTED IT SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL "THAT IS VERY
FLEXIBLE IN ACHIEVING PEACE," AND THAT CONSIDERS THE END OF
HOSTILITIES AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE REBELS MAY BECOME A POLITICAL
PARTY.

   HOWEVER, THE REBELS STATED THE GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED HUMAN
RIGHTS "VIOLATIONS," AND IS KEEPING A CIRCLE AROUND THE UNIVERSITY
CAMPUS AND TRADE UNIONS, YET IT WANTS DILATORY TALKS WITHOUT
COMMITTMENTS.

   THE FMLN SAID THE APPROVAL BY THE U.S. SENATE OF MILITARY AID TO EL
SALVADOR, UPPING IT FROM $85 TO $90 MILLION, "ENCOURAGES THE MOST HARD
LINE SECTOR OF THE CURRENT SALVADORAN REGIME."

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE MILITARY AID "CONSTITUTES A HARD
BLOW AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL
SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT," THAT IN 9 YEARS HAS CLAIMED OVER 70,000
LIVES.

   GOVERNMENT AND FMLN DELEGATIONS MET FROM 13 TO 15 SEPTEMBER IN
MEXICO AND PLEDGED TO SEEK A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THAT COUNTRY'S
STRIFE.

   THE TWO DELEGATIONS AGREED TO CONTINUE THE TALKS ON 16 AND 17
OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE TO ANALYZE THE POSSIBILITY OF A CEASE-FIRE AND
ESTABLISH THE STEPS TO END THE WAR.

   DIVERSE LOCAL SECTORS, WHICH ARE DEMANDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO
THE WAR, HAVE RECEIVED THE AGREEMENTS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF OPTIMISM.

   HOWEVER, SOME LEADERS OF RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
(ARENA) AND SOME MILITARY CHIEFS HAVE QUESTIONED THE FMLN'S OFFERS.


DEV-MUC3-0521 (UMASS)

   BOGOTA, 26 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] THE M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP [19
APRIL MOVEMENT], WHICH IS ABOUT TO SIGN A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH THE
GOVERNMENT, TODAY PROPOSED OPENING A DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS.  ACCORDING TO THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, ONE OF THE DRUG
LORDS IS SURROUNDED.

   MEANWHILE, A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED IN A HOTEL IN THE CARTAGENA DE
INDIAS TOURIST CENTER, ON THE CARIBBEAN, KILLING TWO PERSONS.  IT IS
BELIEVED THE BOMB WAS PLACED BY GROUPS LINKED TO NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS.

   THE M-19 PROPOSED PARDONING THOSE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS WHO
DISMANTLE THEIR BUSINESSES AND BECOME LAW-ABIDING.

   IN RADIO STATEMENTS MADE TODAY, M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO
LEONGOMEZ SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION HAS MADE CONTACT WITH
THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, WHO HAVE REPORTEDLY SAID THEY ARE WILLING
TO JOIN A GENERAL PEACE PLAN.

   THE PROPOSAL WAS SIGNED BY THE HIERARCHY OF THE M-19 -- FOUNDED IN
1974 AND ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS -- IN
THEIR CAMP IN SANTO DOMINGO, SOME 400 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA.

   IN EXCHANGE FOR DISMANTLING THE LABORATORIES AND THE ARMED GROUPS,
THE M-19 PROPOSED NOT EXTRADITING THE ALLEGED NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS TO
THE UNITED STATES.

   THE M-19 PROPOSAL HAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE THE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO
BARCO, INASMUCH AS IT HAD VOICED ITS DETERMINATION NOT TO HOLD ANY
DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, A JUDICIAL SOURCE HAS TOLD
REUTER.

   "THE ISSUE OF THE DIALOGUE IS BECOMING VERY SERIOUS AND I BELIEVE
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY A WAR ALWAYS
CONCLUDES WITH A PEACE AGREEMENT," ONE OF THE ADVISERS OF FORMER
JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF SAID.

   THE M-19 PROPOSAL, WHICH INCLUDES A PLAN SO THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS THEMSELVES WILL FINANCE A CAMPAIGN AGAINST DRUG
CONSUMPTION, HAS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED YET BY THE GOVERNMENT.

   IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, IT WAS STRESSED THAT THE ISSUE OF THE
DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS WILL NOT FORM PART OF THE
PEACE AGREEMENT REACHED WITH THE M-19.

   RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS AND THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS HAVE HAD THEIR UPS AND DOWNS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.

   AT FIRST, SOME ARMED GROUPS GAVE PROTECTION TO THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY FOR PURCHASING WEAPONS.  HOWEVER,
LATER, WHEN THEY TRIED TO TAKE OVER PART OF THE BUSINESS, THEY WERE
HARSHLY FOUGHT BY THE PARAMILITARY BANDS OF THE EXTREME RIGHT FINANCED
WITH DRUG MONEY.

   PIZARRO SAID TODAY THAT THE TOPIC WILL NOT AFFECT THE SIGNING OF
THE AGREEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN POSTPONED SINCE 24 SEPTEMBER FOR
"LAST-MINUTE MINOR DIFFICULTIES."

   HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE WEAPONS OF THE ORGANIZATION, WHICH HAS
OVER 600 MILITANTS, WILL NOT BE TURNED OVER TO THE ARMY, BUT TO AN
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, PROBABLY THE RED CROSS.

   HOWEVER, WHILE THE M-19 -- WHICH ACCORDING TO THE PEACE PLAN SHOULD
BE DEMOBILIZED AT THE END OF THE YEAR -- IS ASKING FOR A DIALOGUE WITH
THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ANNOUNCED THAT
GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALSO KNOWN AS "EL MEXICANO," IS SURROUNDED
AND WILL BE IMMINENTLY CAPTURED.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS) HAS
TOLD REUTER: "WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE CAPTURING IMPORTANT PEOPLE WITHIN
THE NEXT FEW DAYS, ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT KNOW IF RODRIGUEZ GACHA WILL
ALSO BE CAPTURED."

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND PABLO ESCOBAR ARE CONSIDERED THE CAPOS OF THE
FEARFUL MEDELLIN CARTEL, A NARCOTICS ORGANIZATION WHICH TOGETHER WITH
ITS TWIN ORGANIZATION IN CALI IS CHARGED WITH EXPORTING 80 PERCENT OF
THE COCAINE CONSUMED IN THE UNITED STATES.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED A 100-MILLION-PESOS REWARD
($250,000) TO ANY CITIZEN PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF
THE TWO MOST-WANTED MEN IN COLOMBIA.

   ON 25 SEPTEMBER, A JUDGE ORDERED THE ARRESTED OF FREDDY RODRIGUEZ
CELADES, SON OF "EL MEXICANO," FOR ILLEGAL PSSESSION OF FIREARMS.

   NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA RECENTLY
ANNOUNCED THAT THE TWO NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS ARE IN COLOMBIAN
TERRITORY, THUS DENYING RUMORS TO THE EFFECT THEY WERE SETTING UP
BASES IN PANAMA OR BRAZIL.  


DEV-MUC3-0522 (UMASS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 SEP 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [TEXT] IT HAS BEEN
REPORTED THAT THE AIRSTRIP IN CHILANGA, 5 KM NORTH OF THE CITY OF SAN
FRANCISCO DE LA GOTERA, WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY DESTROYED. SEVERAL OTHER
POSITIONS INSIDE THE CITY WERE ALSO ATTACKED. UNTIL NOW, NO GOVERNMENT
OR REBEL CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. THE HIGHWAY LEADING FROM SAN
FRANCISCO GOTERA TO SAN MIGUEL WAS MINED BY THE REBELS. TRAFFIC ALONG
THIS HIGHWAY HAS CEASED UNTIL NOW.

   IN LA UNION, THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
REBELS SAID THAT TROOPS OF THE FONSECA BATTALION OF THE 3RD DETACHMENT
OF LA UNION WERE ATTACKED IN SAN SEBASTIAN NEAR SANTA ROSA DE LIMA.
THE REBELS CLAIM THEY CAPTURED 3 SOLDIERS. ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN
FRANCISCO GOTERA, THE REBELS CLAIM THEY CAPTURED 2 SOLDIERS OF THE 4TH
DETACHMENT OF SAN FRANCISCO GOTERA.

   IN OTHER INCIDENTS, IT WAS REPORTED THAT SINCE 1600 LOCAL TIME ON
25 SEPTEMBER THERE HAVE BEEN FIERCE CLASHES IN VALLE NUEVO NEAR EL
PARAISO IN CHALATENANGO. UNTIL NOW OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE NOT REPORTED
ANY CASUALTIES.

   IN EL PAPAYAL, CIVILIAN SOURCES REPORT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO
INCIDENTS IN THIS GOVERNMENT TELEPHONE EXCHANGE AND MICROWAVE STATION.

   CLASHES CONTINUED THIS MORNING BETWEEN TROOPS OF THE 3RD AND 6TH
INFANTRY BRIGADES IN USULUTAN. PATROLS ARE CHASING THE REBELS.

   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT IN CIUDAD BARRIOS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
SAN MIGUEL THE REBELS PLACED SOME ROADBLOCKS AND DISTURBED MILITARY
POSITIONS. NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THESE INCIDENTS.

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN YOLAIQUIN THE REBELS ALSO ATTACKED TROOPS
OF THE 4TH DETACHMENT OF GOTERA. YOLAIQUIN IS IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.

   IN MONCAGUA, ALSO IN SAN MIGUEL, ROADBLOCKS WERE PLACED ON THE
HIGHWAY TO CHAPELTIQUE. NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED IN THESE
INCIDENTS.

   THE NATIONAL GUARD POST IN SESORI, NORTH OF SAN MIGUEL, WAS ALSO
ATTACKED.  NO CASUALITES WERE REPORTED IN THIS INCIDENT.

   IN ANOTHER INCIDENT IN CUSCATLAN , IT WAS REPORTED THAT TROOPS OF
THE 5TH DETACHMENT GUARDING THE BRIDGE AT LAS GUARAS WERE ATTACKED
EARLY THIS MORNING BY THE REBELS. NO OFFICIAL BULLETIN HAS BEEN ISSUED
BY THE 5TH DETACHMENT.

   THE TOWN OF SAN BARTOLOME PERULAPIA WAS ATTACKED. NO ADDITIONAL
DETAILS ARE KNOWN.

   UNTIL NOW, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE, COPREFA, HAS ONLY
REPORTED FOUR SOLDIERS WOUNDED IN THE SAN FRACISCO GOTERA AREA. IT
ADMITS THAT THE AIRSTRIP IN CHILANGA WAS DAMAGED. NO CASUALTIES HAVE
BEEN REPORTED ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY WERE FIERCE CLASHES TOOK
PLACE THIS MORNING STARTING AROUND 0200, AND WHICH ARE CONTINUING NOW
IN CERTAIN AREAS.

   COPREFA REPORTS THE DEATH OF 14 GUERILLAS NEAR TEJUTLA. ACCORDING
TO THE OFFICIAL BULLETIN, 14 GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED IN CLASHES WITH
TROOPS OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE IN CHALATENANGO. THE BULLETIN ALSO
REPORTS THAT IMPORTANT MILITARY EQUIPMENT WAS SEIZED FROM THE FMLN
GUERRILLAS.


DEV-MUC3-0523 (UMASS)

   NO CITY (COLOMBIA), 26 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] ACCORDING TO
THE PACT SIGNED TODAY, A BILATERAL COMMISSION THAT WILL BE CREATED
SOON WILL DISCUSS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GUERRILLA GROUP WILL BE
DEMOBILIZED.

   M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO SAID TODAY THAT THE ORGANIZATION,
WHICH HAS A LITTLE MORE THAN 600 MEMBERS, WILL NOT TURN IN ITS WEAPONS
TO THE ARMY, BUT TO AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, POSSIBLY THE RED
CROSS.

   HOWEVER, WHILE THE M-19 IS CALLING FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT GONZALO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS "EL MEJICANO," HAS BEEN SURROUNDED AND WILL
SOON BE CAPTURED.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY DEPARTMENT, THE
COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION, TOLD REUTER: "WE BELIEVE THAT
IMPORTANT ARRESTS WILL BE MADE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, ALTHOUGH WE DO
NOT KNOW IF WE WILL CATCH RODRIGUEZ GACHA."

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND PABLO ESCOBAR ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE HEADS OF
THE FEARSOME MEDELLIN CARTEL, AN ORGANIZATION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS
THAT, ALONG WITH ITS TWIN ORGANIZATION IN CALI, IS ACCUSED OF
SUPPLYING 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE THAT IS CONSUMED IN THE UNITED
STATES.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED A REWARD OF 100 MILLION PESOS
($250,000) TO ANY CITIZEN WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS
OF THE TWO MOST WANTED MEN IN COLOMBIA.

   YESTERDAY, A JUDGE ISSUED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF FREDDY
RODRIGUEZ CELADES, SON OF "EL MEJICANO," FOR THE ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF
WEAPONS.

   IN RECENT STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS, GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA,
CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT BOTH DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE IN
COLOMBIAN TERRITORY, THUS DENYING REPORTS THAT THEY HAD REPORTEDLY
MOVED THEIR BASES OF OPERATION TO PANAMA OR BRAZIL.

   FINALLY, IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, A TOURIST CENTER ON THE CARIBBEAN
COAST, A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED IN A HOTEL, KILLING TWO PEOPLE.

   THE ATTACK WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN WHICH OVER 70 BOMBS HAVE
EXPLODED IN A LITTLE OVER 1 MONTH.  


DEV-MUC3-0524 (UMASS)

   BOGOTA, 26 SEP 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] IN A NEW ACTION ATTRIBUTED TO THE
DRUG TRAFFICKING RINGS OPERATING IN BOGOTA, A MEDIUM-SIZED BOMB
PARTIALLY DESTROYED A SECONDARY SCHOOL LOCATED IN A POPULOUS SOUTHERN
BOGOTA NEIGHBORHOOD TONIGHT.

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION SEVERELY DAMAGED THE SAN IGNACIO
DE LOYOLA SCHOOL, LOCATED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM A POLICE STATION.

   AUTHORITIES SAID THE EXPLOSION CAUSED NO CASUALTIES, ALTHOUGH IT
RESULTED IN LOSSES AMOUNTING TO MILLIONS.

   THE DYNAMITE ATTACK, THE 41ST IN BOGOTA DURING THIS MONTH, OCCURRED
ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTER ANOTHER EXPLOSION DESTROYED ONE STORE OF A
SUPERMARKET CHAIN.

   NUMEROUS THREATS SAYING THAT BOMBS HAD BEEN PLANTED IN SCHOOLS HAVE
BEEN REPORTED IN THE "WAR" THAT THE DRUG CARTELS HAVE DECLARED IN
REPRISAL FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENSE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THEM.


DEV-MUC3-0525 (UMASS)

   NO CITY (COLOMBIA), 27 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [BARCO] SOME OF THE
ARRESTED PERSONS ARE EXTRADITABLE.  THE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN UP AGAINST
TERRORISM, AND THE TERRORISTS CANNOT HIDE FOREVER.

   THIRD, MUCH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR COLOMBIA, ITS DEMOCRACY, ITS
PEOPLE, AND ITS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MOBILIZED.  COLOMBIA IS NO LONGER
SEEN AS A COUNTRY OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SOMETHING IT HAS NEVER BEEN AND
NEVER WILL BE.

   NOW EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY OF BRAVE PEOPLE
WHERE THE MAJORITY ARE HONEST AND HARD-WORKING.  THE WORLD HAS
ACKNOWLEDGED AND PRAISED DEMOCRACY IN COLOMBIA, THE VICTIM OF A
PROBLEM IT HAS NOT CREATED.

   FOURTH, INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY NARCOTERRORISTS
CONTINUE GIVING POSITIVE RESULTS.  MORE THAN 25 BANDS OF ASSASSINS
HAVE BEEN DISMANTLED, AND THEIR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DISPERSED.  TWO OF
THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN
HAVE CONFESSED TO THE CRIME.  THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
SECURITY HAS IDENTIFIED 110 PERSONS WHO FORM PART OF A NARCOTERRORIST
NETWORK.  THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSASSINATIONS HAVE BEEN CLEARED UP.

   FIFTH, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHECK THE TERRORISTS'
COUNTEROFFENSIVE, ALTHOUGH IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE CRIMINALS ARE
STILL CAPABLE OF CAUSING MUCH DAMAGE.  THIS HAS BEEN MADE EVIDENT BY
THE EXPLOSIVES THEY HAVE PLACED, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED AND WHO HAVE
BEEN INJURED, AND THE FIRES THEY HAVE PRODUCED.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FRUSTRATE MANY ATTACKS.
CRIMINALS WHO HAVE CARRIED OUT ATTACKS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.  FOR
EXAMPLE, IN MEDELLIN, 35 CRIMINALS WHO WERE COORDINATING WITH THE
TERRORIST NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.

   SIXTH, DRUG TRAFFICKING CAPABILITIES HAVE DECREASED.  NOW THERE IS
MUCH LESS COCAINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER WORLD MARKETS. IT
IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT IT IS UP TO THE UNITED STATES
AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITIES TO DIMINISH
AND CONTROL DRUG CONSUMPTION.  IF THERE WERE NO ADDICTS IN THOSE
COUNTRIES, THERE WOULD BE NO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   THIS IS NOT THE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES INVOLVED
IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  IF DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE UNABLE
TO USE THEIR MONEY THROUGH INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND INVESTMENT
OPPORTUNITIES THAT OTHER COUNTRIES OFFER, THE INCENTIVES FOR THE
BUSINESS WOULD VANISH.

   IF THE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROCESS COCAINE DID
NOT ARRIVE IN OUR COUNTRY FROM EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, THE DRUG
COULD NOT BE PRODUCED.

   IF THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS MARKET WERE UNDER CONTROL, THE TERRORISTS
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE ARMS THEY HAVE USED TO SPILL SO
MUCH BLOOD IN COLOMBIA.  [CONTINUED]

THE 39 FORMER GN [NATIONAL GUARD] MEMBERS NOW IN JAIL WILL NOT BE
RELEASED UNTIL THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN HONDURAS ARE
DEMOBILIZED.  COMMANDER NUNEZ DEMANDED THAT THE CONTRAS RELEASE MORE
THAN 1,000 NICARAGUANS THEY HAVE KIDNAPPED AND STOP MURDERING
CIVILIANS.  HE SAID THAT THE 39 FORMER GN MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED
WHEN THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IS DEMOBILIZED IN HONDURAS, AS WAS AGREED

QUOTE HUMANITARIAN UNQUOTE REASONS, ARE GOING TO STAY IN PRISON AND
WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE LIST [PARDON LIST THAT INCLUDES 457
PRISONERS APPROVED BY THE NICARAGUA LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ON 26
SEPTEMBER].  LIKEWISE, THE REST OF THE CONTRA PRISONERS, WHO ARE NOT
ON THIS LIST, WILL ALSO REMAIN IN PRISON.  THEY WILL REMAIN THERE
UNTIL WE HAVE HAVE CLEAR, DEFINITE INDICATIONS FROM THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT AND THE MERCENARIES THAT THEY ARE GOING TO COMPLY WITH
AGREEMENTS.  THEY WILL STAY IN PRISON UNTIL WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THE
DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THE
COUNTRY'S POLITICAL ACTIVITY.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE WORD
RECONCILIATION TO BE CHANGED INTO DEMAGOGUERY.  THIS WORD HAS REAL
MEANING.  WE ARE WILLING TO COMPLY WITH AGREEMENTS AND HAVE EVIDENCED
OUR WILLINGNESS WITH GESTURES OF GENEROSITY.  WE ARE NOT ASKING THE
CONTRAS TO BE GENEROUS.  WE ARE ASKING THE CONTRAS TO COMPLY WITH THE
TELA AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN HONDURAS.  WE ARE ALSO ASKING FOR COMPLIANCE
WITH THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES DURING THE
NATIONAL DIALOGUE, THAT THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN KIDANAPPED BY THE
CONTRAS BE RETURNED, AND THAT THEY STOP THEIR ATTACKS AND MURDERS THAT
EVEN NOW -- ALTHOUGH SOME POLITICIANS ARE BLIND TO THIS --
CONTINUE. [END RECORDING]

62 OF RIONEGRO MUNICIPALITY, NORTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, HAS
ACQUITTED DRUG TRAFFICKERS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ
GACHA OF CHARGES OF MASTERMINDING THE MURDER OF ATTORNEY GENERAL
CARLOS MAURO HOYOS AND THE KIDNAPPING OF BOGOTA CITY MAYOR ANDRES
PASTRANA.

   THE RULING WAS ISSUED ON THE NIGHT OF 25 SEPTEMBER AND REVEALED ON
26 SEPTEMBER.

   HOYOS WAS KIDNAPPED ON 25 JANUARY 1988 AND WAS FOUND DEAD 8 HOURS
LATER NEAR THE MEDELLIN AIRPORT.  PASTRANA WAS KIDNAPPED ON 22 JANUARY
1988 BUT WAS RESCUED BY THE ARMY 3 DAYS LATER.

   THE "EXTRADITABLES" CLAIMED CREDIT AT THE TIME FOR THESE TWO
ACTIONS.

   IN HIS FIRST RULING, JUDGE FRANCISCO CARDENAS SAID "THERE IS NOT
SUFFICIENT GROUNDS OR EVIDENCE" FOR LINKING ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE MAIN CHIEFTAINS OF THE MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL, TO
THE CRIMES.  THE EXTRADITION OF THE DRUGPINS HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT.

   THE PROSECUTOR IN THE CASE HAS APPEALED JUDGE CARDENAS' RULING

   BOGOTA, 27 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS
COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE HAVE ARRESTED 30 CRIMINALS WHO BELONG TO A
BAND OF HIRED ASSASSINS OPERATING IN THE CONFLICTIVE MIDDLE MAGDALENA
AREA OF THE COUNTRY'S CENTRAL REGION.

   AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY
(DAS) -- THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE AGENCY THAT ADVISES COLOMBIAN
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO -- SAYS THAT 15 OF THOSE ARRESTED ARE
IMPLICATED IN MURDERS.

   IN ADDITION, THE DAS MANAGED TO DISMANTLE FOUR GROUPS OF HIRED
ASSASSINS KNOWN AS "THE COCKROACHES, "THE PLATEAUS," "THE SMUDGED
ONES," AND "DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS" (MAS).

   MEANWHILE, THE ARMY HAS REPORTED THAT NINE PRIVATELY-OWNED, LIGHT
AIRCRAFT USED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING WERE CONFISCATED DURING VARIOUS
OPERATIONS CONDUCTED THIS WEEK.  THE AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO
THE NATIONAL DRUG COUNCIL AND THEIR OWNERS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION.

   THE TWO OPERATIONS ARE PART OF THE OFFICIAL OFFENSIVE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING MAINTAINED BY BARCO'S GOVERNMENT SINCE 18 AUGUST.

   LA PAZ, 28 SEP 89 (LA RED PANAMERICANA) -- [TEXT] BOLIVIAN
PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA HAS STATED THAT BOLIVIA NEEDS ADEQUATE
ASSISTANCE TO SOLVE ITS PROBLEMS.  HE ADDED THAT BOLIVIA NEEDS A
LEADER LIKE NORIEGA TO ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE WITH U.S. REPORTERS, PRESIDENT PAZ YESTERDAY
ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING
AND THE ERADICATION OF COCA CROPS. THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT STRESSED THE
EFFORTS MADE BY THE BOLIVIAN PEOPLE TO OVERCOME HYPERINFLATION OF MORE
THAN 27,000 PERCENT. HE SAID THAT INFLATION IS PREDICTED TO REACH 12
PERCENT DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION.

   PAZ ZAMORA STATED THAT THE HIGHLY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES MUST PAY
ATTENTION TO NATIONS SUCH AS BOLIVIA THAT FACE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC
SITUATIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. HE
CRITICIZED THE BEHAVIOR OF WORLD POWERS, AND HE SAID THAT SUCH
BEHAVIOR MUST BE CHANGED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PAZ ZAMORA] WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE WAY
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND THEIR PEOPLE ARE BEHAVING, MAINTAINING
CERTAIN SADOMASOCHISTIC RELATIONS WITH THE UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS.
[END RECORDING]

   THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT TRIED TO MAKE THE U.S. PRESS UNDERSTAND THE
INDIFFERENCE THAT CERTAIN COUNTRIES, NAMELY THE ECONOMIC POWERS, SHOW
TOWARD BOLIVIA.

   TO EXPLAIN HIS REMARKS, HE SAID THAT PERHAPS A GENERAL SHOULD
ASSUME POWER, AND MILITARY FORCES SHOULD BESIEGE THE U.S. EMBASSY, AND
A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE SHOULD BE MURDERED TO GET THE ATTENTION OF THE
WORLD.

   PAZ ZAMORA DEMANDED GREATER UNDERSTANDING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS THAT IMPOSE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS FOR ACHIEVING
ECONOMIC STABILITY. DOES A WAR KILL MORE PEOPLE THAN AN ECONOMIC
ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM, THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT ASKED. HE INVITED THE U.S.
REPORTERS TO REVIEW THE STATISTICS ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED IN
THE SALVADORAN WAR AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DIED IN BOLIVIA
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS.

   PRESIDENT PAZ HAS STATED THAT THE FACT THAT BOLIVIA IS A COCA-
PRODUCING COUNTRY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE U.S. TREATMENT OF THE
MATTER. HE SAID THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING DEMANDS
ACTION TO CONTROL CONSUMPTION. HE ADDED THAT BOLIVIA IS NOT RECEIVING
THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS RESULTING
FROM THE REDUCTION OF COCA PRODUCTION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PAZ] AN ANTINARCOTICS PROGRAM FOR BOLIVIA SIMILAR
TO THAT IMPLEMENTED IN COLOMBIA WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE [END
RECORDING].

   HE DEMANDED REAL ALTERNATIVES FOR WORK AND PRODUCTION FOR BOLIVIAN
PEASANTS. HE SAID THAT UNTIL THIS IS ACHIEVED, THE MISTAKES OF THE
PAST WILL BE REPEATED.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN'S VILLALOBOS BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTED] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [VILLALOBOS] WE ARE
CONTRIBUTING TO THE EFFORT TO STOP FASCISM AND BRING ABOUT A GENUINE
DEMOCRACY.  THE BASIS FOR A NEGOTIATION IN EL SALVADOR SHOULD BE THAT
DEMOCRACY PRECEDES PEACE.  OUR COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT WE ARE SEARCHING
FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.  WE MENTION THEM IN THAT ORDER BECAUSE IF WE
WERE TO SEEK PEACE FIRST, AS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS, WE WOULD HAVE THE
PEACE OF DEATH.

   [REPORTER] YOU REFERRED TO COMBATANTS AND THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.
HOWEVER, IN THE PAST FEW DAYS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT
OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FASCIST REGIME; THAT IS, THE FMLN MAIMED.
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT THEIR PLIGHT AND ATTITUDE?

   [VILLALOBOS] THE STRUGGLE OF THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT INVOLVING
INDIVIDUALS WHO WAGE IMPORTANT BATTLES WITHOUT WEAPONS IS QUITE
ADMIRABLE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE STRUGGLE OF THE WAR MAIMED IS TWICE AS
ADMIRABLE.  THEY ARE NOT ONLY WAGING A BATTLE WITHOUT WEAPONS, BUT
WITH THEIR MUTILATED BODIES.

   THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT IS EXPERIENCING VERY TRYING MOMENTS.  IT IS
FACING REPRESSION.  THIS SHOWS THE REGIME AS IT REALLY IS.  THE MAIMED
HAVE ALSO DEALT A VERY IMPORTANT BLOW: THEY HAVE EXPOSED THE BRUTALITY
AND STUPIDITY OF ARMY LEADERS WHO SET UP ANTIRIOT CORDONS, SURROUNDED
THE CATHEDRAL, AND THREATENED PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO WALK OR ARE
MISSING A LIMB [WORDS INDISTINCT].  IT IS REALLY A HEROIC STRUGGLE
MUCH LIKE THE ONES THAT MANY MAIMED COMRADES HAVE WAGED FROM THEIR
JAILS.  THEY HAVE OPENED THE WAY FOR OTHER COMRADES TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.

   I THINK THIS IS TO BE ADDED TO THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLE'S
FORCES WHO HAVE TAKEN UP THE BANNER OF PEACE AND DEMOCRACY, EVEN THE
WAR-DISABLED, HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR EFFORT WITH THEIR SACRIFICE.

   BOGOTA, 29 SEP 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] IT WAS REPORTED TODAY IN BOGOTA
THAT THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS REJECTED AN APPEAL PRESENTED BY
BEATRIZ RODRIGUEZ ZUNIGA'S LAWYER, WHO WANTED HER ARREST FOR
EXTRADITION PURPOSES CANCELLED.  RODRIGUEZ ZUNIGA IS SAID TO BE AN
IMPORTANT MEDELLIN CARTEL CONNECTION.

   RODRIGUEZ ZUNIGA WAS ARRESTED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IN CARTAGENA AND,
WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S CONSENT, COULD BE THE SECOND PERSON
EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES, PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE
AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIAS THAT STARTED A MONTH AND A HALF AGO.

   ON 6 SEPTEMBER THE ALLEGED "FINANCIAL HEAD" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL,
EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, WAS SENT TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER
WASHINGTON PRESENTED DOCUMENTATION TO HAVE HIM TRIED IN AN ATLANTA
COURT.

   DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTARTION INVESTIGATIONS REPORT THAT MARTINEZ
ROMERO WAS A KEY PERSON IN THE "WASHING" OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION
THE MAFIA OBTAINED FROM THE COCAINE BUSINESS.

   THE DRUG "BARONS" HAVE PUBLICLY THREATENED TO MURDER 10 JUDGES FOR
EACH COLOMBIAN EXRADITED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY.

   SINCE MARTINEZ ROMERO WAS SENT TO ATLANTA THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS
OF DYNAMITE ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT COLOMBIAN CITIES.  THESE ATTACKS ARE
THE COCAINE CARTELS' DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE
AGAINST THEM.

   BOGOTA, 24 SEP 89 (EL TIEMPO) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] WHAT
IS THE TRUTH OVER THE SIGNING OF THE DECREES?  WERE THEY SIGNED ONLY
AFTER THE ATTACK ON LUIS CARLOS GALAN?

   [DE GREIFF] THE DECREES WERE BEING STUDIED SINCE NOON ON THE DAY OF
HIS DEATH.  IT HAD BEEN A VERY TOUGH WEEK.  THE MAGISTRATE AND THE
COLONEL HAD BEEN MURDERED; GALAN WAS MURDERED THAT EVENING.  THERE WAS
MUCH DISCUSSION OVER THE DRAFTS, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE ATTACK ON
GALAN HURRIED THINGS UP.

   IN THE CASE OF THE EXTRADITION DECREE, WE WERE ALL AWARE THAT IT
WAS NOT A POPULAR MEASURE.  PHILOSOPHICALLY, MOST MINISTERS DID NOT
LIKE THE IDEA OF COLOMBIANS BEING TRIED ABROAD.  THERE WAS MUCH LEGAL
DISCUSSION, NOT ONLY TO DO WITH THIS CASE, BUT ALSO OVER THE NEW
MEASURES CONCERNING RAIDS, SEIZURES, AND ARRESTS.

   HOWEVER, FINALLY THERE WAS A GREAT DETERMINATION TO GIVE THE
COUNTRY ANSWERS.

   [REPORTER] THE COUNTRY'S CURRENT PROBLEMS HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THE
EXTRADITION DECREE.

   [DE GREIFF] WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT THESE MEASURES ARE NOT AGAINST
A GROUP OF PEOPLE, BUT AGAINST VIOLENCE.  EXTRADITION HAS BEEN A VERY
TOUGH MEASURE FOR EVERYONE.  THE INCONVENIENCES AND THE LEGALITY OF
THIS DECREE, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE REACTIONS AGAINST IT, WERE
DISCUSSED A GREAT DEAL.  IT CAN BE THAT PART OF THE VIOLENCE GENERATED
HAS BEEN DUE TO THE EXTRADITION DECREE.

   [REPORTER] IS IT POSSIBLE TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS AS A WAY OF ENDING THE COUNTRY'S VIOLENCE?

   [DE GREIFF] THE GOVERNMENT SAID NO TO THE DIALOGUE, BUT WE MUST
WAIT AND SEE HOW EVENTS DEVELOP.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A GOVERNMENT'S
DECISION CAN BE STRICT, BECAUSE SITUATIONS DO CHANGE.  THE PRESIDENT
HAS SAID THAT DIALOGUE IS IMPOSSIBLE.  YOU NEVER KNOW, THINGS MAY
CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

   ANYWAY, IN COLOMBIA PRACTICALLY NO WARS HAVE ENDED, BECAUSE IN
NEARLY ALL WARS AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED.

   [REPORTER] BUT IF COLOMBIA HOLDS A DIALOGUE, THE WORLD'S DOORS WILL
PROBABLY CLOSE ON COLOMBIA.

   [DE GREIFF] LOOK, IN THE UNITED STATES I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE
EXTRADITION AND I SAID IT WAS NOT POPULAR, THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO
SOLVE THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM.  IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S
STANCE, BUT IF IT IS DECIDED TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THEN THIS WOULD BE A
SOVEREIGN COLOMBIAN DECISION.  OBVIOUSLY, IF THE POSITION CHANGES A
BAD IMPRESSION WILL BE GIVEN.

   THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT IT HAS NOT LOST ITS
SOVEREIGNTY.

   [REPORTER] THE INTERNATINAL PRESS FEELS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH
YOUR RESIGNATION.  ONE MUST NOT FORGET THAT YOU BECAME A SYMBOL FOR
THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHEN YOU TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON.

   [DE GREIFF] I HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE ON 22 SEPTEMBER AND I TOLD
THEM THAT MY RESIGNATION WAS NOT MONICA DE GREIFF'S POSITION, BUT THE
GOVERNMENT'S.  I TOLD THEM I WAS STAYING IN THE COUNTRY, AND I
EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT THE MINISTERS HERE REMAIN AT THEIR POSTS UNTIL
THE PRESIDENT DECIDES OTHERWISE.  HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND
WHY.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WILL MONICA DE GREIFF DO?

   [DE GREIFF] I AM GOING TO REST FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN RETURN.  I
AM GOING TO HELP ERNESTO SAMPER'S CAMPAIGN.  I ALSO BELIEVE THAT
WORKING FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WILL BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

   [REPORTER] WHAT POST HAS GIVEN YOU THE GREATEST SATISFACTION?

   [DE GREIFF] WHEN I WAS AT THE MINISTRY OF MINES AND ENERGY. IT WAS
FASCINATING.  I HAD TWO VERY GOOD BOSSES: GUILLERMO PERRY AND OSCAR
MEJIA.  I WORKED IN DELIGHTFUL HARMONY WITH A GROUP OF GOOD PEOPLE.  I
BELIEVE THAT MINING AND HYDROCARBONS IS THE SECTOR THAT HAS ENJOYED
THE GREATEST PROGRESS UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS YOUR FINAL FEELING UPON LEAVING THE MINISTRY?

   [DE GREIFF] EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.  I HAVE BEEN SPARED
FROM MANY BORING THINGS.  I HAVE NOT HAD TO SIGN EXTRADITION ORDERS OR
THINGS LIKE THAT.  WITHOUT REALIZING IT, I HAVE BEEN SPARED OF TIRING
THINGS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 29 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [EXCERPT] THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT WILL OFFER A "TOTAL AMNESTY" TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).  IN EXCHANGE, IT WILL ASK THE
INSURGENTS TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN CIVILIAN LIFE, JUSTICE
MINISTER OSCAR SANTAMARIA ANNOUNCED TODAY.

   IN STATEMENTS TO A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION, SANTAMARIA SAID THE
PROPOSAL WILL BE OFFICIALLY PRESENTED TO THE REBEL LEADERS DURING THE
SECOND ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE, WHICH WILL BE HELD 16 - 17 OCTOBER IN
SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.

   SANTAMARIA, WHO IS THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE
COMMISSION SPOKESMAN, MET FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH THE FMLN LEADERS ON
13, 14, AND 15 SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO CITY.

   ON 21 SEPTEMBER, DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HUMBERTO LARIOS, FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN THE 9 YEARS OF WAR, SAID THAT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF
ARMY TROOPS, AS DEMANDED BY THE REBELS, IS FEASIBLE.  HE SAID THE
GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING A DOCUMENT ON THE CEASE-FIRE THAT IT WILL
PRESENT AT THE COSTA RICA MEETING.

   DURING THE MEXICO MEETING THE PARTIES IN CONFLICT AGREED TO HOLD
MEETINGS TO TRY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THE WAR, WHICH HAS RESULTED
IN 70,000 DEATHS OVER A 9-YEAR PERIOD.

   DESPITE THE DIALOGUE, THE GUERRILLAS THIS WEEK LAUNCHED ONE OF THE
MOST VIOLENT MILITARY CAMPAIGNS YET, WHICH EVEN AFFECTED SAN SALVADOR.
THIS GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN IS IN RESPONSE TO "INCREASING REPRESSION AND
ASSASSINATIONS" OF LABOR LEADERS.

   THE ONLY ISSUE TO BE DISCUSSED AT THE COSTA RICA MEETING WILL BE
THE CEASE-FIRE.  THE TWO PARTIES HAVE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT AN
AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR.

   IN ADDITION TO THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF ARMY TROOPS, THE
REBELS PROPOSED IN MEXICO THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH BE REORGANIZED AND
THAT A PROSECUTOR [FISCAL] BE APPOINTED AS A RESULT OF A CONSENSUS
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES.  IN RESPONSE TO A
QUESTION ABOUT THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE ARMED STRUGGLE BY THE
REBELS, SANTAMARIA SAID: "WE ARE AT A STAGE WHERE THE TENSION LEVEL IS
DECLINING.  WE HAVE FOUND POINTS OF AGREEMENT, AND WE AND WILL HONOR
THEM."

   SAN SALVADOR, 29 SEP 89 -- [COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] WE REPORT TO YOU THE
FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE
SEARCH FOR A JUST AND LASTING PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.

   1.  WE NOTE WITH DEEP CONCERN THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ALARMING
INCREASE IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN WAR NORMS VIOLATIONS BY THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES.  THESE VIOLATIONS CAN BE OBSERVED IN
THE REPRESSION OF DEMONSTRATIONS, TORTURES, MURDERS, ARRESTS -- MORE
THAN 400 IN THE PAST MONTH -- DISAPEARANCES, AND IN THE GOVERNMENT'S
REFUSAL TO ALLOW MAIMED FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] MEMBERS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO GET MEDICAL ATTENTION.  THIS
NORM IS STIPULATED IN THE GENEVA CONVENTION, AND THIS IS AN AGREEMENT
THAT HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  THIS SITUATION HAS
BEEN CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE RESOLUTION ISSUED BY THE
SUBCOMMISSION [30-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] PERIOD IN AUGUST 1989.
MR CRISTIANI SAID THIS RESOLUTION WAS NOT TRUTHFUL.

   2. GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN AND MR CRISTIANI HIMSELF HAVE REPEATEDLY
STATED THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE DEPENDS ON THE FMLN'S HALTING
HOSTILITIES.  THIS PRESENTS A UNILATERAL PLAN THAT HAS NOT BEEN AGREED
UPON POLITICALLY, MILITARILY, OR OPERATIONALLY.

   IN CONTRAST TO THESE STATEMENTS, WHEN THE FMLN UNILATERALLY
DECLARED A TRUCE RECENTLY, MR CRISTIANI, OFFICIALS IN HIS
ADMINISTRATION, AND MILITARY COMMANDERS STATED THAT THESE FMLN
MEASURES WERE PROPAGANDISTIC AND THAT THE TRUCE WAS NOT RESPECTED.
THEIR ARGUMENTS WERE ATTEMPTS TO JUSTIFY THE GOVERNMENT'S BREAKING OF
THE TRUCE.

   THESE EVENTS GIVE US ADDITIONAL GROUNDS FOR STATING THAT A DEFINITE
AND UNCONDITIONAL HALT TO HOSTILITIES IS UNREALISTIC AND UNFEASIBLE.

   BOGOTA, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SPANISH) -- [SPEECH] [BARCO] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [BARCO] RECENT EXPRESSIONS OF SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT FOR
COLOMBIA HAVE GREATLY ENCOURAGED US IN THESE TRYING TIMES.  WE ARE NOW
LIVING IN DIFFERENT TIMES, BUT THE SITUATION IS NO LESS CRITICAL THAN
THE ONE THAT LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS.

   A NEW WORLD WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED BY AN AGGRESSOR THAT DOES NOT
RESPECT THE TRADITIONAL RULES OF WAR OR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY.  THE
AGGRESSOR IS A PERNICIOUS INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT HAS
GREAT POWER AND RESOURCES AND THAT IS NOURISHED BY ILLEGAL REVENUES
GENERATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   AS THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL RECENTLY SAID, AND I QUOTE: THE ILLEGAL
USE OF AND TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS TODAY IS SEEN AS A SOCIAL PLAGUE THAT
AFFECTS BOTH INDUSTRIALIZED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  ALTHOUGH
EFFORTS TO FIGHT THIS SCOURGE HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS,
STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MONETARY VALUE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS GREATER
THAN THAT OF THE INTERNATIONAL OIL TRADE AND IS ONLY SURPASSED BY ARMS
TRAFFICKING.  IT IS CERTAINLY WORRISOME TO SEE THAT MANKIND IS SO
DEEPLY INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING DEGRADATION AND DEATH.  END OF THE
SECRETARY GENERAL'S STATEMENT.

   THE MEMBERS OF THESE CRIMINAL CARTELS WERE BORN IN VARIOUS
COUNTRIES, AND MANY OF THEIR LEADERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE COLOMBIANS.
ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MY
COUNTRY, I MUST CLARIFY THAT THEY ARE COLOMBIANS IN NAME ONLY.  THEY
ARE REALLY JUST INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES WHO HAVE NO HOME.  COLOMBIA IS
NOT THEIR HOMELAND! [APPLAUSE]

   I AM ALSO HERE AT THE UNITED NATIONS TO PRESENT TO YOU THE CRUDE
REALITY OF THIS WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  COLOMBIA IS ON THE
FRONTLINE OF THIS BATTLE.  FOR US IT IS NOT A WAR OF WORDS.  MANY
COLOMBIANS HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THEIR FIRM COMMITMENT AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  APPROXIMATELY 1 MONTH AGO, LUIS CARLOS GALAN, ONE OF THE
MOST PRESTIGIOUS POLITICAL LEADERS IN MY COUNTRY, WAS ASSASSINATED.
HIS DEATH HAS CONSOLIDATED EVEN MORE THE NATION'S WILL AND HAS DRAWN
THE WORLD'S ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE
DIED OVER THE YEARS -- AS HE DID -- AS VICTIM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.
THAT LONG LIST INCLUDES 12 MAGISTRATES OF THE SUPREME COURT, AN
ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND A JUSTICE MINISTER.  PROMINENT CONGRESSMEN,
JUDGES, MAYORS, JOURNALISTS, THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND
COLOMBIAN CITIZENS HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR DEMOCRACY.

   LAST MONTH, AFTER ANNOUNCING EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING, WHICH WERE DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE STATE OF SIEGE, DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE CONTINUED AND INTENSIFIED
THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS. [CONTINUED]

HOURS.

   SPANIARD JOSE MARIA MARTINEZ, FRENCHMAN ROBERTO LISANDY, AND
ITALIAN DINO ROSSY, WHO WERE STAYING AT A TECUN UMAN HOTEL, WERE
KIDNAPPED BY ARMED MEN WHO TOOK THEM TO AN UNKNOWN PLACE.

   AFTER THEY WERE RELEASED, THE THREE EUROPEANS WENT TO THE REGIONAL

   MARTINEZ TOLD THE POLICE THAT THE KIDNAPPERS HELD THEM IN A DARK

   THE THREE MEN WERE TAKEN TO A MEDICAL CENTER AFTER THEIR RELEASE
AND, ACCORDING TO THE MEDICAL REPORT, SUFFERED NO WOUNDS.

   OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT MARTINEZ AND LISANDY DO BUSINESS IN TECUN
UMAN AND HAVE BEEN LIVING THERE FOR THE PAST 9 MONTHS.  ROSSY WAS
ENJOYING HIS VACATION HERE, WHEN HE WAS KIDNAPPED.

   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, THE PERSONS WHO KIDNAPPED THE THREE MEN
GOT THEM DRUNK BEFORE RELEASING THEM SO THAT THEY WOULD LOSE TRACK OF

[TEXT] THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES MEANS NATIONS HAVE THE
ABILITY TO SETTLE THEIR DOMESTIC PROBLEMS BY THEMSELVES.  BASED ON
THIS VIEW, SEVERAL OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST OUSTANDING DEMOCRATS AND
DUPES DENOUNCED FOREIGN MILITARY AID TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING, A
SCOURGE THAT BECAME AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM A LONG TIME AGO AND IS
WEAKENING COLOMBIAN SOVEREIGNTY.

   I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THOSE WHO ARE NOW MOST OPPOSED TO THE PRESENCE
OF U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS AND EXPERTS ARE THOSE WHO REGARD THIS
PRESENCE AS A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO THE ARMED ORGANIZATIONS THEY PROMOTE
AND THAT ARE TRAINED BY LIBYAN, BRITISH, CUBAN, AND ISRAELI EXPERTS.

   IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SOVEREIGNTY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT FOR
THE EXISTENCE OF A STATE.  HOWEVER, WE LOST OUR SOVEREIGNTY LONG AGO
AND TO REGAIN IT WE MUST ACCEPT ALL THE AID THE HONEST INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY CAN OFFER US.

   SOVEREIGNTY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MEANS ADOPTING DECISIONS BASED ON
THE NEEDS OR PREFERENCES OF THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  THAT STOPPED
HAPPENING IN COLOMBIA WHEN THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS BEGAN TO INTIMIDATE
AND DESTROY THE LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE.  HOW CAN WE TALK
OF SOVEREIGNTY WHEN WE SEE THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE FALLEN PREY TO
TERRORISM; THAT THEY ARE LIVING AND DYING ENSLAVED BY DAILY BOMBINGS
AND LIES; THAT THEY ARE GOVERNING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THREATS; THAT
THEY HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN A HOME IMPRISONED BY FEAR?  IT IS ABSURD TO
TALK OF A TRULY SOVEREIGN STATE WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT SEVERAL OF THE
COUNTRY'S TOP POLITICAL AND BUSINESS LEADERS ARE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL
ACTIVITIES.  AN ACT OF SOVEREIGNTY -- ONE IN THE MIDST OF SO MUCH
SUBJUGATION -- WOULD BE TO STRIP OURSELVES OF SO MUCH VAIN PRIDE AND
ACCEPT THE FACT THAT WE ARE WEAK AND NEED ALL THE HELP OFFERED BY
ANYONE WHOSE INTENTIONS ARE BASED ON THE LAW.  MOREOVER, IT IS IRONIC
THAT SEVERAL OF THOSE WHO ARE CLAMORING FOR "THE DEFENSE OF
SOVEREIGNTY" ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE NOW ASKING THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT
TO EXPLAIN THE CANCELLATION OF VISAS.  IS IT NOT A MATTER OF NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY TO DECIDE WHO CAN AND CANNOT ENTER THAT COUNTRY?

   I AM REMINDED OF THOSE THOUSANDS OF CASES OF FOOD AND MEDICINE
DONATED TO COLOMBIA FOLLOWING THE ARMERO CATASTROPHE THAT ROTTED IN
THE COUNTRY'S CUSTOMS WAREHOUSES.  ARMERO IS THE BURIAL GROUND FOR
30,000 COLOMBIANS AND THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY OF THOUSANDS MORE.
DESPITE THE REGRETTABLE END THAT THIS AID MET IN SO MANY WAREHOUSES,
NOBODY OPPOSED INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WITH THAT CORNER OF TOLIMA
DEPARTMENT.

   THE WAR ON DRUG TRAFFICKERS COULD BURY US.  LET US STRUGGLE FOR
SOVEREINGTY AND ACCEPT THE ADVICE OFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES, OR WE
WILL END UP ROTTING IN A WAREHOUSE FILLED WITH WHITE POWDER.

ARMY [ELN] GUERRILLA MOVEMENT, WHICH KIDNAPPED SPANISH BUSINESSMAN
PABLO MARTIN BERROCAL ALMOST 2 MONTHS AGO IN QUITO, IS DEMANDING 1
BILLION PESETAS RANSOM FOR HIS RELEASE.

   SOURCES CLOSE TO THE REBEL GROUP, THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS NOT JOINED
THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE PROCESS IN COLOMBIA, TOLD EFE THAT NEGOTIATIONS
FOR HIS RELEASE ARE BEING CARRIED OUT IN AN UNIDENTIFIED BORDER TOWN.

   COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS, DISGUISED AS POLICEMEN, KIDNAPPED THE
55-YEAR-OLD BUSINESSMAN LAST 9 AUGUST AT THE HOTEL WHERE BERROCAL WAS
STAYING IN THE DOWNTOWN SECTION OF THE ECUADORAN CAPITAL.  THE SAME
SOURCES STATED THAT BERROCAL'S WIFE, BLANCA PARADELA, AND A PARTNER
ARE IN COLOMBIA NEGOTIATING FOR THE BUSINESSMAN'S RELEASE DIRECTLY
WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ELN, A REBEL GROUP LED BY FORMER SPANISH
PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ,

   THE ELN HAS NOT ANNOUNCED THE MOTIVE FOR THE KIDNAPPING.  SOURCES
CONSULTED WITH BY EFE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE COLOMBIAN
REBEL GROUP HAS ONLY ECONOMIC MOTIVES.

   BERROCAL OWNS A BULLFIGHTING RING IN QUITO AND HE PARTICIPATES WITH
HIS BROTHER, BULLFIGHTING BUSINESSMAN LUIS MARTIN BERROCAL, IN LA
SEPULVEDANA TRANSPORTATION COMPANY.

   NEITHER THE COLOMBIAN NATIONAL POLICE NOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS), CHARGED WITH THE COUNTRY'S SECRET
INVESTIGATIONS, HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON MARTIN BERROCAL OR HIS ALLEGED
PRESENCE IN THE COUNTRY.

TO BOGOTA IN MID-SEPTEMBER, DID NOT GET IN CONTACT WITH THE COLOMBIAN
AUTHORITIES WHEN THEY PASSED THROUGH THIS CITY.

   THE ELN, A MARXIST-LENINIST ORIENTED GROUP THAT HAS BEEN INVOLVED
IN ARMED STRUGGLE FOR 25 YEARS, HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY ITS ATTACKS
ON THE COLOMBIAN OIL ENTERPRISE AND FREQUENT KIDNAPPINGS OF NEWSMEN

DECLARED PERSONA NON GRATA AND ARE NOT BEING ALLOWED TO ENTER PERU.
THIS WAS LEARNED BY OUR CORRESPONDENT FROM SOURCES CLOSE TO ISRAELI
COMPANIES DEALING WITH THE SALE OF SECURITY KNOW-HOW.

   THE LONDON OBSERVER, QUOTING PERUVIAN CONGRESS MEMBERS, REPORTED
THAT EVIDENCE CONCERNING ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRAINING OF A
RIGHT-WING TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN LIMA DISAPPEARED FROM THE FILES
OF A CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION PROBING ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN PERU.
OUR CORRESPONDENT HANAN 'AZRAN HAS MORE DETAILS:

   THE REPORTS IN THE LONDON OBSERVER APPARENTLY STEM FROM LEFT-WING
CIRCLES AND PERUVIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS.  THE MOST PROMINENT GROUP IS
THE SHINING PATH, A GUERRILLA GROUP AIMING TO OVERTHROW THE REGIME.
THESE CIRCLES CONTEND THAT ISRAELIS TRAIN WHAT THEY TERM THE
RIGHT-WING DEATH, OR TERROR, SQUADS.  THEY APPARENTLY REFER TO THE
RODRIGO FRANCO COMMANDO UNITS, TO WHICH THE LIQUIDATION OF GUERRILLA
MEMBERS AND OF OPPONENTS TO THE REGIME IS ATTRIBUTED.

   POLITICAL CIRCLES IN JERUSALEM HAVE SAID THAT THESE CLAIMS OF
ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRAINING OF DEATH SQUADS ARE GROUNDLESS.

   ISRAELI COMPANIES ARE INVOLVED IN MILITARY TRAINING AND IN
MANEUVERS IN PERU.  ISRAELI EXPERTS HAVE SET UP THE PERUVIAN ARMY'S
ANTITERROR SQUAD.  ONE OF THE SQUAD'S FOUNDERS WAS GABI KOHEN, A
FORMER ISRAEL POLICE ANTITERROR UNIT COMMANDER.  GABI KOHEN WAS A
PARTNER IN THE DAT COMPANY, WHICH OFFERED SIMILAR TRAINING AND
INSTRUCTION SERVICES TO ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND
ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD.

   DAT OPERATED IN PERU WITH THE PERMIT OF SIBAT, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY
DEFENSE SALES DEPARTMENT.  ONE MEMBER OF THE COMPANY WAS A SENIOR
BORDER POLICE OFFICER, FORMER BORDER POLICE COMMANDER TZVI BAR, WHO
RETIRED FROM THE COMPANY AFTER A SHORT PERIOD, TURNING TO OTHER
ENTERPRISES.

   ONE COMPANY WITH DIVERSE OPERATIONS IN PERU WAS THE ISDS OWNED BY
LEO GLASER, ALSO AN IDF [ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES] ELITE UNIT GRADUATE.
ISDS HAD PERMANENT OFFICES IN LIMA HEADED BY RAN GAZIT, WHO LATER
OPENED A BUSINESS OF HIS OWN ELSEWHERE.  THE COMPANY HAD DEFENSE
MINISTRY APPROVAL FOR ITS WORK IN PERU.  ACCORDING TO ITS DIRECTORS,
IT TRAINED SECURITY GUARDS FOR CIVILIAN BUSINESSES ONLY, INCLUDING THE
USE OF FIREARMS AND PROTECTION MEASURES.

   BOGOTA, 3 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE AUTHORITIES OF THE EASTERN
DEPARTMENT OF ARAUCA, IN THE OIL PRODUCING SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY, HAVE
ANNOUNCED THAT MSGR JESUS EMILIO JARAMILLO WAS MURDERED AND THAT HIS
BODY WAS FOUND TODAY.  THE AUTHORITIES BLAMED THE LEFTIST ARMY OF
NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) GUERRILLAS FOR THE MURDER.

   YESTERDAY SEVERAL ARMED MEN KIDNAPPED JARAMILLO, THE BISHOP OF
ARAUCA, AND HIS ASSISTANT, ELMER MUNOZ, BUT LATER RELEASED THE LATTER.

   GENERAL RAFAEL PADILLA, COMMANDER OF THE 2D ARMY DIVISION,
CONFIRMED THAT BISHOP JARAMILLO DIED FROM TWO GUNSHOTS TO THE HEAD.
HE BLAMED THE ELN'S DOMINGO LAIN FRONT FOR THE CRIME.

   GEN PADILLA PRAISED MSGR JARAMILLO'S WORK OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS
IN FAVOR OF THE POOR IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT, BUT DID NOT EXPLAIN WHAT
REASONS THE GUERRILLAS COULD HAVE HAD FOR MURDERING THE PRELATE.

   THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT A CHURCH OFFICIAL OF SUCH HIGH RANKING
HAS BEEN MURDERED IN COLOMBIA.

   THE ELN, THE MOST ACTIVE AND VIOLENT GUERRILLA GROUP IN THE
COUNTRY, HAS REPEATEDLY REJECTED THE OFFERS OF PEACE FROM THE LIBERAL
ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO. THE ELN--WHICH IS LED BY
MANUEL PEREZ, A SPANISH CITIZEN AND FORMER PRIEST--HAS MADE THE
COUNTRY'S OIL INFRASTRUCTURE THE MAIN TARGET OF ITS TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES.

   SANTIAGO, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
GROUPS HOLDING THE SAME POLICIES THAT FAILED IN CHILE AT THE END OF
THE 1960'S AND THE BEGINNING OF THE 1970'S WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH
THEMSELVES IN OTHER PLACES.

   NOW WE ARE WITNESSING THE COLLAPSE OF THE ILLUSIONS AND OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OF TOTALITARIAN AND COLLECTIVIST SYSTEMS. IT SEEMS THAT
PEACE IS BEING CONSOLIDATED.  THE WORLD POWERS HAVE AGREED TO WORK FOR
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND MORE RATIONAL RELATIONS.  THE WORLD IS
BECOMING INCREASINGLY INTERDEPENDENT.

   OUR MODERN KNOWLEDGE, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND RESOURCES HAVE
OVERCOME BORDERS AND LIMITATIONS.  THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THESE PROBLEMS, THEREFORE, ARE A CHALLENGE
FOR WORLD COOPERATION AND THIS ORGANIZATION.

   ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES FACING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
TODAY IS THE DRAFTING OF EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING.
WE SUPPORT COLOMBIA FOR ITS COURAGE TO FACE THE POWERFUL CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE USING THE NATION FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES.  CHILE
HAS IMPLEMENTED A STRICT PREVENTIVE PROGRAM TO CONTROL THE MOST
DANGEROUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THE PROBLEM.  WE ARE NOT A DRUG PRODUCING
COUNTRY.  WE ARE VICTIMS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   IN ONE OF ITS FIRST DECISIONS ON THE PROBLEM, IN SEPTEMBER 1973,
THE GOVERNMENT EXPELLED A GROUP OF FOREIGN DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO HAD
ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN NORTHERN CHILE, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
PREVAILING POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CRISIS.  WE ARE CONVINCED THAT
COUNTRIES CANNOT FIGHT THE PROBLEM ALONE.  THE WORLD HAS DECLARED WAR
ON DRUGS.  WE MUST BE AWARE THAT TRANSITORY VICTORIES WILL NOT
ERADICATE THE PROBLEM.  ONLY WITH PROPER EDUCATION WILL WE BE ABLE TO
NURTURE THE STRENGTH OF OUR YOUTH, ALERT THEM TO THE DANGERS OF DRUG
CONSUMPTION, AND PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING VICTIMS.

   THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST ASSIGN THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO
IMPLEMENT EFFICIENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS.

   WE HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT TERRORISM FOR MANY YEARS.  TODAY WE
WANT TO REITERATE OUR REJECTION AND REPUDIATION OF TERRORISM.
CHILEANS ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO TERRORISM BECAUSE WE CONTINUOUSLY
EXPERIENCE THEIR COWARDLY AND IRRESPONSIBLE ATTACKS.  WE HAVE OFTEN
SEEN HOW SOME NATIONS RECEIVE CONFESSED TERRORISTS WHO ASK FOR
POLITICAL ASYLUM.

   IF MODERN SOCIETIES WANT TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND NARCOTERRORISM,
THEY WILL HAVE TO ACT DECISIVELY.  TERRORISTS SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN
REFUGE OR PROTECTION ANYWHERE.

   SOME INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PERMITTED THE SYSTEMATIC
MANIPULATION OF THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS FOR POLITICAL REASONS.  THE
PARTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH MANIPULATION HAVE TRIED TO INCLUDE THE
LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF A NATION TO DEFEND ITSELF FROM TERRORISM AND
SUBVERSION IN THE DEFINITION OF HUMAN RIGHT VIOLATIONS.  IT IS NOT
THAT WE DENY THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE.  WE CONDEMN THE GROSS
MANIPULATION OF THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  THIS MANIPULATION SHOWS
THAT THOSE PARTIES DO NOT RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS THEMSELVES.  HUMAN
RIGHTS SHOULD BE RESPECTED BY ALL NATIONS WITHOUT EXCEPTION.

   IT IS NOT FAIR TO PASS JUDGMENT ON COUNTRIES LIKE CHILE THAT HAD TO
STRUGGLE HARD TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES CREATED BY TERRORISM AND
SUBVERSION.  TERRORISM SET FOOT IN CHILE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF
DISRUPTION IN THE INSTITUTIONAL ORDER BETWEEN 1970 AND 1973.  THOSE
PASSING JUDGMENT MUST CONSIDER THE GENERAL SITUATION THAT PROVOKED THE
COLLAPSE OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.

   IN CHILE WE HAVE BUILT A SOCIETY IN WHICH HUMAN RIGHTS ARE
PROTECTED NOT ONLY BY DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE LAW, BUT ALSO BY
THE CHILEAN PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO RESPECT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, VALUES,
AND BELIEFS.  THOSE RIGHTS ARE ALSO PROTECTED BY TODAY'S SPIRIT OF
COEXISTENCE.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 5 OCT 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALAN SECURITY
FORCES TODAY DECLARED A "GENERAL ALERT" AFTER A RADIO STATION IN THE
CAPITAL RECEIVED A PHONE CALL IN WHICH AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON
THREATENED A GENERALIZED ATTACK ON RADIO STATIONS THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY.

   ODILIO DELEON, 42, AN ANNOUNCER FOR RADIO CULTURAL, TOLD THE POLICE
THAT HE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL YESTERDAY IN WHICH AN ATTACK ON RADIO
STATIONS WAS THREATENED.  NO REASON FOR THE THREAT WAS GIVEN.

   POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT IN VIEW OF THIS REPORT, SECURITY FORCES
WERE ALERTED AND INVESTIGATIONS BEGUN TO IDENTIFY THOSE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS PLAN.

   OVER 20 MONTHS AGO, THE OPERATOR OF A TRANMISSION TOWER FOR CHANNEL
7 TELEVISION WAS KILLED BY A HIGH-POWERED BOMB DETONATED BY
UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS.

   THE HOME OF ROLANDO ARCHILA, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF GUATEMALA'S
EMISORAS UNIDAS, THE RADIO STATION WITH THE LARGEST AUDIENCE IN THE
COUNTRY, WAS DAMAGED IN A TERRORIST ATTACK.

   THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT ATTRIBUTED THESE ACTIONS TO
"EXTREME RIGHTIST" GROUPS SEEKING TO "DESTABILIZE THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS INITIATED IN JANUARY, 1986," AFTER 2 DECADES OF MILITARY
REGIMES.

   SO FAR, IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE THREAT TO THE RADIO STATIONS WAS
MADE BY THOSE GROUPS, OR IF IT CAME FROM THE EXTREME LEFT (THE
GUERRILLAS).

   LIMA, 4 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA HAS
ASKED SOME EUROPEAN NATIONS TO ATTEND THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING OF THE
COCA PRODUCING COUNTRIES AND U.S. AUTHORITIES AT WHICH THE DRUG
TRAFFICKING ISSUE WILL BE DISCUSSED.

   GARCIA SAID THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS ADDRESSED TO THE FRENCH, ITALIAN,
AND SPANISH CHIEFS OF STATE, FRANCOIS MITTERRAND, GIULIO ANDREOTTI,
AND FELIPE GONZALEZ, RESPECTIVELY.

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE TO FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS, ALAN GARCIA
SAID THAT EUROPE MUST ATTEND THIS MEETING BECAUSE IT IS A STRONG DRUG
MARKET AND BECAUSE OF THE LINKS BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS AND
TERRORISTS.

   GARCIA CRITICIZED THE PLAN PROPOSED BY WILLIAM BENNETT, THE WHITE
HOUSE'S MAIN ADVISER FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING AFFAIRS, ON THE GROUNDS THAT
IT "LACKS SERIOUSNESS AND IS INCONCEIVABLE." THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR
$250 MILLION IN AID FOR COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU FOR FIGHTING DRUG
TRAFFICKING IN 1990.

   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT THIS AMOUNT IS "RIDICULOUS" IF
COMPARED WITH THE $8 BILLION THAT THE BENNETT PLAN ASSIGNS FOR
FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES, AND WITH THE U.S.
$300 BILLION MILITARY BUDGET.

   ALAN GARCIA CRITICIZED THE FACT THAT THE UNITED STATES GAVE
COLOMBIA "PLANES FROM THE KOREAN WAR ERA AND OLD HELICOPTERS THAT WERE
USED HERE (IN PERU)."

   HE SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT FORM ALLIANCES WITH
GOVERNMENTS BUT WITH COCA FARMERS, AND THAT IT SHOULD IMPLEMENT
COMPREHENSIVE REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING GUARANTEED SALES.

   "PERU DOES NOT HAVE DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEMS, BUT AN AGRICULTURAL
SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN DISTORTED BY THE U.S. DEMAND," ALAN GARCIA
ADDED, NOTING THAT THE MOST FERTILE PERUVIAN LAND IS DEDICATED TO COCA
FARMING.

   ALAN GARCIA SAID THAT IF THE 200,000 HECTARES OF COCA FARMS IN PERU
(WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 60 PERCENT OF WORLD PRODUCTION) ARE "DRASTICALLY
ERADICATED," MORE THAN 400,000 PEASANTS WILL BE LEFT "IN ABSOLUTE
MISERY," ADDING THAT THESE PEASANTS MAY JOIN THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS
OPERATING IN THE COCA PRODUCING ZONE OF ALTO HUALLAGA, IN THE
AMAZONIAN REGION.

   "IF THE UNITED STATES HAS LIVED WITH DRUG ADDICTION FOR DECADES, I
DON'T SEE WHY IT NOW WANTS TO DROP KIND OF ATOMIC BOMB ON THE HUALLAGA
ZONE," HE ADDED.

   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT DECLINED TO COMMENT ON A U.S. CHARGE THAT
GENERAL GUILLERMO ARCINIEGAS, CHIEF OF THE HUALLAGA MILITARY ZONE, HAS
USED DRUG TRAFFICKERS' MONEY TO FIGHT TERRORISTS.

   "JUST AS WE HAVE NEVER SAID THAT U.S. OFFICIALS OR POLICEMEN ARE
ACCOMPLICES WITH DRUG ADDICTS, WE CANNOT TOLERATE THE CHARGE THAT
THOSE WHO FIGHT SUBVERSION IN PERU ARE ACCOMPLICES WITH DRUG
PRODUCERS," HE NOTED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 OCT 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SOME 80 MEMBERS AND
SUPPORTERS OF THE FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS OF POLITICAL
PRISONERS (FECMAFAN) TODAY "FORCIBLY" OCCUPIED THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY
IN SAN SALVADOR TO DENOUNCE "THE REPRESSION OF THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT"
OF EL SALVADOR.

   COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ, WHO CONSIDERS HIMSELF A
HOSTAGE, SAID THAT THE EMBASSY WAS "TAKEN OVER BY FORCE BY ARMED
INDIVIDUALS" WHILE ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WERE
INSIDE THE BUILDING.

   A MEMBER OF THE FECMAFAN TOLD NEWSMEN THAT "THE PURPOSE OF THIS
OCCUPATION IS TO DENOUNCE BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT OF NOBEL PEACE PRIZE
WINNER OSCAR ARIAS AND BEFORE THE OTHER GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD, THE
REPRESSION TO WHICH THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR ARE
BEING SUBJECTED."

   THE FECMAFAN MEMBER ADDED THAT THE OCCUPATION IS ALSO BEING USED TO
REACH THESE GOVERNMENTS TO ASK THEM TO APPLY PRESSURE ON SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO GET HIM TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR HUMAN
RIGHTS.

   AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ SAID: "THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS OCCUPATION,
BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS MET WITH ALL SECTORS.  THIS IS HARDLY THE
TREATMENT THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS SHOWN EXTREME
CONCERN IN SEEKING A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT."

   IN ADDITION TO AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ, CONSUL HUMBERTO MURILLO,
COUNSELOR CARLOTA DE LOPEZ, AND FIRST SECRETARY LUIS DE ANDA ARE
INSIDE THE 54-SQUARE-METER OFFICE, AS WELL AS 10 PERSONS WHO WERE
SEEKING VISAS.

   DE ANDA TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT HE WAS HIT ON THE LEFT HAND WHEN THE
OCCUPIERS TRIED TO OPEN HIS DESK DRAWER.

   THE DOORS TO THE EMBASSY, WHICH IS IN A 10-STORY BUILDING IN
WESTERN SAN SALVADOR, ARE CLOSED, AND THE OFFICES ARE OCCUPIED BY
WOMEN WITH WHITE SCARVES ON THEIR HEADS AND YOUTHS WHOSE FACES ARE
COVERED WITH SCARVES AND GLASSES.  FECMAFAN MEMBERS, WHO CLAIM THAT
THEY ARE NOT CARRYING WEAPONS, ARE GUARDING THE ELEVATOR AND THE DOORS
LEADING TO THE EMBASSY.

   HOWEVER, CONSUL MURILLO SAID THAT HE SAW SEVERAL YOUTHS ARMED WITH
.38-CALIBER REVOLVERS AND EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.

   ACCORDING TO A FECMAFAN MEMBER, OVER THE PAST 3 MONTHS, SOME 150
PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND MORE THAN 500 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OR MADE
TO DISAPPEAR.

   ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE GROUP SAID: "WE ARE PROTESTING THE
LIMITATION OF FREEDOMS IN EL SALVADOR.  IF WE TAKE TO THE STREETS TO
PROTEST WE ARE ARRESTED."

   THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH
HIS GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE "I AM BEING PREVENTED FROM MAKING PHONE CALLS
AND FROM LEAVING THE EMBASSY."

   THE OCCUPIERS ALLOWED FIVE PEOPLE, INCLUDING A PREGNANT WOMAN, TO
LEAVE THE PREMISES AND SAID THAT THEY PLANNED TO STAY IN THE EMBASSY
INDEFINITELY.

   RIVERA Y DAMAS POINTED OUT THAT "I NEED TO OBTAIN AN ARMY PERMIT TO
ENTER THE EMBASSY."

   POLICE DEPUTY DIRECTOR COLONEL ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ SAID THAT THE
CONFLICT COULD END IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE RULED OUT MILITARY INTERVENTION TO EVICT THE
EMBASSY OCCUPANTS, BUT ARE USING "DISSUASIVE" ACTIONS TO PROMPT THEM

THIS CITY.

   IN ORDER NOT TO HINDER THE INVESTIGATIONS, THE POLICE DID NOT
DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE CAPTURED DURING THE
INTELLIGENCE OPERATION IN SOUTHWESTERN BOGOTA.

   A POLICE SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT THE FOUR MEN WERE ARRESTED,
FOLLOWING THE 5 OCTOBER ARREST OF A MAN WHO WAS CARRYING 15 KG OF
DYNAMITE IN A TAXI.

   SHORTLY BEFORE THAT, ANOTHER TERRORIST WAS NEARLY LYNCHED BY SOME
PEOPLE WHO CAPTURED HIM IN NORTHERN BOGOTA, AFTER HE PLACED AN
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN A PRINTSHOP.

   A POLICE PATROL WENT TO THE SITE AND PREVENTED THE PRIVATE CITIZENS
AND BUSINESSMEN AFFECTED BY THE BOMBS FROM SERIOUSLY HARMING THE MAN
WHO WAS, NONETHELESS, SEVERELY BEATEN.

   THE BOGOTA POLICE SAID THAT THE ARREST OF THESE SIX TERRORISTS IN
THE LAST 24 HOURS AIDED IN UNCOVERING A PLAN TO DESTROY AN ELECTRICAL
GENERATING CENTER.

   A POLICE SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED,
THANKS TO THE COOPERATION OF THE PEOPLE.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE QUICK
REACTION BY A GROUP OF BUSINESSMEN LED TO THE ARREST OF ONE OF THE
TERRORISTS.

   THE SECOND TERRORIST WAS ARRESTED BY THE POLICE AFTER A TAXI DRIVER
REFUSED TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND REPORTED HIM AS A SUSPECT.

   WHEN THE SUSPECT WAS INTERROGATED, HE DISCLOSED INFORMATION THAT
ALLOWED THE POLICE TO LOCATE A HOUSE IN SOUTHERN BOGOTA WHERE FOUR MEN
WERE HIDING 250 KG OF DYNAMITE.

   THE TERRORISM AFFECTING SEVERAL COLOMBIAN CITIES IS THE RESPONSE
FROM DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WHO

REITERATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT NEGOTIATE WITH THE KIDNAPPERS
OF TELEVISION MANAGER HECTOR DELGADO PARKER BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT'S
LEGITIMACY ITSELF WOULD BE AT STAKE.  LARCO COX ALSO SAID THAT THE
MEETING OF GROUP OF EIGHT PRESIDENTS WILL BE HELD AS PREVIOUSLY
SCHEDULED AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS IMPLEMENTING EXTREME SECURITY
MEASURES TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF VISITING DIGNITARIES AND
OFFICIALS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] HAS THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS
OF BOLIVIA, PERU, AND COLOMBIA BEEN MOVED FROM PARACAS?

   [LARCO COX] IT IS A MATTER OF LOGISTICS.  THE ORGANIZATION OF THE
TWO MEETINGS IN PARACAS AND LAS DUNAS OVER 2 CONSECUTIVE DAYS WOULD
HAVE MEANT A DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS IN GUARANTEEING PROPER
COMMUNICATIONS.  THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WE HAVE MOVED THE SITE OF THE
FIRST MEETING.

   I HAVE JUST HAD A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADORS OF THE COUNTRIES
MAKING UP THE GROUP OF EIGHT.  WE EXPLAINED TO THEM ALL THE SECURITY
MEASURES WE ARE IMPLEMENTING, NOT ONLY FOR THE PERSONAL SECURITY OF
DIGNITARIES BUT ALSO FOR THE SECURITY OF THE BUILDINGS IN WHICH THE
MEETINGS WILL BE HELD.  PERU'S IMAGE IS AT STAKE.  WE HAVE TO BE VERY
CAREFUL TO PROTECT THIS IMAGE.

   [REPORTER] HAS THE MEETING IN TRUJILLO BEEN CANCELED?

   [LARCO COX] WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT WE LIVE IN A CITY WHERE
RUMORS THRIVE LIKE MUSHROOMS.  I WOULD NOT SAY THE COUNTRY IS LIKE
THAT, BUT IT IS TRUE THAT RUMORS IN THIS CITY USUALLY SPREAD OUT OF
CONTROL.  THE MEETING IN TRUJILLO WILL BE HELD.  I AM PERSONALLY PROUD
OF IT.

   [REPORTER] WHERE WILL THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS OF PERU,
BOLIVIA, AND COLOMBIA BE HELD?

   [LARCO COX] IN ICA, IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE THE GROUP OF EIGHT WILL
MEET THE NEXT DAY.

   [REPORTER] WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN PANAMA?

   [LARCO COX] IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES ON OUR AGENDA.
LET US NOT FORGET THAT PANAMA IS ONE OF THE COFOUNDERS OF THE GROUP OF
EIGHT.  THE GROUP OF EIGHT IS NOW MORE APPROPRIATELY CALLED THE
MECHANISM FOR POLITICAL CONSULTATION AND AGREEMENT, BUT IT WAS
ORIGINALLY MADE UP OF THE CONTADORA GROUP, OF WHICH PANAMA WAS A
MEMBER, AND THE CONTADORA SUPPORT GROUP, WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN LIMA
WHEN ALAN GARCIA TOOK OVER.

   [REPORTER] THE SECURITY OF THE PRESIDENTS IS OF GREAT CONCERN.  IS
EACH ONE ARRIVING WITH THEIR OWN SECURITY?  ARE THERE EXCEPTIONAL
MEASURES BEING IMPLEMENTED?

   [LARCO COX] THE DIGNITARIES MIGHT BRING THEIR OWN PERSONAL SECURITY
FORCES.  HOWEVER, OUR COUNTRY WILL GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF THE AREA,
THE BUILDINGS, AND THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY.

   [REPORTER] FOREIGN SOURCES HAVE BEEN SPECULATING THAT SOME
PRESIDENTS MIGHT NOT COME.  WHAT CAN YOU SAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF
THE HOST COUNTRY?

   [LARCO COX] THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS TO CALL THE AMBASSADORS OF
THESE COUNTRIES TO A MEETING BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO
OBSERVE AND ASSESS OUR GUARANTEES.  THE RESULT OF THE MEETING WAS VERY
POSITIVE; THEY SUPPORTED US WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS.  THE AMBASSADORS HAVE
FOUND OUR EXPLANATION ON THE SECURITY MEASURES BEING IMPLEMENTED VERY
SATISFACTORY.  THESE MEASURES WENT INTO EFFECT TODAY.  SOME OF YOU
MIGHT HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THE OPERATIONS: WE ARE NOT ONLY STOPPING
TRAFFIC TO CHECK CARS, LUGGAGE, AND PEOPLE TRAVELING ON BUSES, BUT WE
HAVE ALSO KEPT A CLOSE WATCH ON NEWCOMERS.  ALL FOREIGNERS WHO HAVE
ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ARE BEING WATCHED.
POLICE ARE CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY ARE IN THE HOTELS WHERE THEY SAID
THEY WOULD BE.  THESE OPERATIONS ARE AIMED AT PREVENTING ANY EXTERNAL
AGGRESSION.  WE ALSO HAVE OUR OWN RISKS, AND MANY MEN FROM THE
NATIONAL POLICE AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE INVOLVED IN THE SECURITY
OPERATIONS THAT BEGAN AT NOON TODAY.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END

SAID THAT HE IS WILLING TO ACCEPT "ALL THE POLITICAL COSTS THAT MAY
EMERGE" FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON TO MILITARY MEN AND CIVILIANS WHO
VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE PARDON WAS ORDERED WITH THE SIGNING OF
SEVERAL DECREES TODAY.

   MENEM TALKED WITH REPORTERS ABOUT THE PARDON.  HE SAID: "I CANNOT
ESTIMATE WHAT THE POLITICAL COSTS WILL BE.  I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY
WILL BE MANY OR NOT BUT I WILL ASSUME MY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COSTS.
WHAT INTERESTS ME IS MY COUNTRY, MY PEOPLE."

   MENEM ADDED: "ACQUITTAL MEANS PARDON, AND FROM NOW ON ALL THOSE WHO
RECENTLY VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN PARDONED."

ABLE TO BUILD AN ARGENTINA WHERE IT WILL BE WORTH LIVING."  REGARDING
THOSE PARDONED, MENEM SAID THAT HE WISHED THEM WELL AND THAT "THEY
SHOULD WORK IN PEACE HERE IN ARGENTINA OR ANYWHERE ELSE."

THEM" BECAUSE "IF THE PRESIDENT PARDONED THEM IN THE NAME OF WHAT HE
REPRESENTS AND IF IN SOME WAY HE REPRESENTS THE LAW AND A LARGE SECTOR
OF THE COMMUNITY, THEN I AM WILLING TO TALK WITH ANYONE WHO WANTS."

   HE DENIED HAVING BEEN PRESSURED TO IMPLEMENT THE PARDON QUICKLY
"EITHER BY THE ARMED FORCES OR CIVILIANS."  HE POINTED OUT THAT "THERE
IS A MAN WHO DID NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON; HE IS
ADMIRAL ARMANDO LAMBRUSCHINI WHOSE 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED

DEV-MUC3-0555 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 8 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSSES HAVE
PROPOSED TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT A "DEMOBILIZATION PLAN" THAT
WOULD ENTAIL THE END OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES, THE SURRENDER OF
WEAPONS, AND THE REPATRIATION OF CAPITAL IN EXCHANGE FOR A PARDON. THE
PLAN WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN 3 MONTHS AT THE LATEST, ACCORDING TO
INFORMATION PUBLISHED TODAY ON THE ALREADY FAMOUS GOVERNMENT-MAFIA
DIALOGUE BY LA PRENSA.

   THE OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER LA PRENSA, OF BOGOTA, YESTERDAY PUBLISHED
A REPORT ACCORDING TO WHICH SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY GERMAN
MONTOYA, ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, HELD PEACE TALKS FOR A
YEAR WITH SPOKESMEN FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE OFFICIAL HAS DENIED
THIS REPORT AND DESCRIBED IT AS "HARMFUL AND SLANDEROUS."

   ACCORDING TO NEWSPAPER REPORTS, THE CARTEL BOSSES PRESENTED THE
PLAN TO THE PRESIDENCY IN SEPTEMBER 1988 AND THE PRESIDENCY SHOULD
HAVE WORKED ON IT "DIRECTLY AND SECRETLY."

   THE PROPOSAL, WHICH HAD THREE PHASES, WAS FORMULATED AFTER THE
MAFIA BOSSES HAD DECIDED TO ACCEPT PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S PEACE
PLAN (WHICH WAS PROPOSED TO THE COUNTRY ON 1 SEPTEMBER 1988) "WITHOUT
HESITATION."

   ACCORDING TO THE CARTEL PLAN, IN ADDITION TO GRANTING THE PARDON,
THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO LIFT THE STATE OF SIEGE REGULATIONS TO FIGHT
TERRORISM AND DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO SECURE FROM THE UNITED STATES A
JUDICIAL PARDON FOR COLOMBIANS WANTED BY U.S. FEDERAL COURTS.  THIS
LAST ASPECT WAS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS
"BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS DID NOT FIND A WAY TO DISCUSS THE
MATTER WITH THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, WHICH HAS DECIDED TO FIGHT THE
PROBLEM MILITARILY," ACCORDING TO FORMER MINISTER JOAQUIN VALLEJO, WHO
ACTED AS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN THE TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDING TO VALLEJO, A TRIPARTITE DIALOGUE BETWEEN
COLOMBIA AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (COCAINE
CONSUMERS) ON THE NONEXTRADITION OF COLOMBIANS WAS AN ESSENTIAL
REQUIREMENT FOR MONTOYA TO GO AHEAD WITH THE PACIFICATION CONTACTS.

   THE FORMER MINISTER SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DECLARED WAR ON
DRUG TRAFFICKERS BECAUSE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD TAKEN THIS MEASURE
FIRST."  HE ADDED: "AFTER THE NUMEROUS MURDERS OF THE RECENT MONTHS,
THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP TALKING (WITH THE DRUG
BOSSES)."

   IN ACTIONS THAT OBSERVERS DESCRIBED AS "INEXPLICABLE," ASSASSINS
PAID BY THE COCAINE CARTELS KILLED FIVE COLOMBIAN PERSONALITIES,
INCLUDING PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN, BETWEEN 27 JUNE AND
18 AUGUST.

   MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TODAY
CONTINUED TO BE SEVERELY CRITICIZED AND ACCUSED OF HANDLING THE
ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE WITH A "DOUBLE STANDARD" AND CONCEALING "MANY
TRUTHS" RELATED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   ALVARO LEYVA, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL OF THE OPPOSITION SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO SECURED THE DOCUMENTS THAT LA PRENSA PUBLISHED,
POINTED OUT: "I WANT THE FULL TRUTH TO BE DISCLOSED
 BECAUSE THE FATE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE IS AT STAKE."

   LEYVA FINALLY SAID: "I WANT TO KNOW ALL.  IT IS A SAD THING DEAD
MEN CANNOT SPEAK, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT
MEANT BUSINESS, AND WHO THOUGHT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY AUTHORITIES DO
WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL."

   BOGOTA, 8 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19),
WHICH RECENTLY LAYED DOWN ITS WEAPONS TO REJOIN CIVILIAN LIFE AFTER
ACCEPTING THE PEACE PROCESS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT
VIRGILIO BARCO, BECAME A POLITICAL PARTY TODAY IN THE HOPE OF RULING
THE COUNTRY.

   AT THE END OF THE M-19'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE HELD IN THE SOUTHWESTERN
CITY OF POPAYAN, CAUCA PROVINCE, THE MOVEMENT WAS FORMALLY CONSTITUTED
AS A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION WITH ITS LEADER, CARLOS PIZARO LEONGOMEZ,
PROCLAIMED AS A PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL.

   THE M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP, FOUNDED IN THE EARLY 1970'S AND
CONSIDERED ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST ACTIVE, BECAME RENOWNED WHEN IT
OCCUPIED THE DOMINICAN EMBASSY IN BOGOTA AND HELD SEVERAL AMBASSADORS
HOSTAGE AND WHEN IT LATER OCCUPIED THE PALACE OF JUSTICE, WHERE
SEVERAL MAGISTRATES AND SUBVERSIVES WERE KILLED.

   THE M-19 ANNOUNCED THE COMPOSITION OF ITS DIRECTORATE, WHICH IS
HEADED BY PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ AND INCLUDES SOME MEMBERS OF THE M-19'S
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, SUCH AS ANTONIO NAVARRO, GERMAN ROJAS, OTTI
PATINO, AND LIBARDO PARRA.

   IT ALSO INCLUDES MARCO CHALITA, WHO WILL RUN FOR THE SENATE FOR THE
SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF HUILA, AND VERA GREIFF, ROSEMBERG PABON, ANYAIR
ARTUNDUAGA, AND HEBER BUSTAMANTE.

   THE M-19 CONSIDERS IT A PRIORITY TASK TO CREATE A FOUNDATION BASED
IN THE CARIBBEAN PORT OF SANTA MARTA, WHICH WILL MANAGE FUNDS TO AID
THE RELATIVES OF SLAIN GUERRILLAS.

   THE FOUNDATION WILL BE NAMED AFTER JAIME BATEMAN, IDEOLOGIST AND
FOUNDER OF THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION, WHO WAS KILLED IN AN AIRPLANE
ACCIDENT IN PANAMA.

   LIMA, 8 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS
ESTABLISHED UNPRECEDENTED SECURITY MEASURES TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF
THE GROUP OF EIGHT PRESIDENTS AND FOREIGN MINISTERS WHO WILL BEGIN
MEETING ON 9 OCTOBER IN TRUJILLO, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD-LARGEST CITY,
570 KM NORTH OF LIMA.

   ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS, SOME 15,000 OFFICERS, INCLUDING POLICE,
ARMY, NAVY, AND AIR FORCE PERSONNEL, WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURITY
AT TRUJILLO AND ICA, 300 KM SOUTH OF LIMA.

   ARGENTINE PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JOSE SARNEY,
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, URUGUAYAN PRESIDENT JULIO MARIA
SANGUINETTI, MEXICAN PRESIDENT CARLOS SALINAS, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT
CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL MEET AT
THE "LAS DUNAS" HOTEL IN ICA 11-12 OCTOBER.  HOTEL WORKERS AND
EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN REPLACED AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE.

   THE PRESIDENTS OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WILL ALSO BE MEETING
IN ICA ON 10 OCTOBER TO ANALYZE THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH
AFFECTS THEIR COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY.

   THIS MEETING WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR PARACAS, A TOWN NEAR ICA,
BUT WAS MOVED TO ICA FOR SECURITY REASONS.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO BARRACKS THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY SINCE LAST NIGHT BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO SOURCES, IT IS EXPECTED
THAT THE SHINING PATH AND THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT
(MRTA) WILL TRY TO STAGE VIOLENT ACTS DURING THE MEETINGS.

   THE GUARDS AROUND THE EMBASSIES OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT COUNTRIES
HAVE BEEN REINFORCED WITH POLICE DOGS TRAINED TO DETECT EXPLOSIVES.

   POLICE HAVE ALSO ARRESTED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN LIMA TO CHECK ON
ANY POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS TO GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS OR TO SEE IF THEY HAVE
ACCOUNTS TO SETTLE WITH THE COURTS.

   THE ROUNDUPS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT TO FIND LOCAL TELEVISION
MAGNATE HECTOR DELGADO PARKER, WHO WAS APPARENTLY KIDNAPPED BY THE
MRTA DURING AN INCIDENT IN WHICH DELGADO'S DRIVER WAS KILLED AND HIS
BODYGUARD WOUNDED.

   THE KIDNAPPING WAS CARRIED OUT BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE, TWO OF WHOM
WERE DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORMS, IN THE STREETS OF LIMA ON 4 OCTOBER.

   NEWSPAPER SOURCES TODAY SAID THAT AN ALLEGED LIEUTENANT TO MRTA
CHIEF VICTOR POLAY, WHO HAS BEEN IN PRISON SINCE DECEMBER 1988, HAS
ALSO BEEN ARRESTED.

   LIMA, 8 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO A CONFIDENTIAL PERUVIAN
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIMA DAILY LA
REPUBLICA, THE PERUVIAN SHINING PATH GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION IS
PLANNING TO PROVOKE A FOOD SHORTAGE IN LIMA.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THIS ALLEGED SHINING PATH STRATEGY, BASED
ON THE THEORY BY THE LEADER OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION, MAO ZEDONG, "OF
LAYING SIEGE TO THE CITY FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE," IS PART OF THE
TERRORISTS' EFFORTS TO BOYCOTT THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS OF 12 NOVEMBER
1989 AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, THE GENERAL AND CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS OF
APRIL 1990.

   ACCORDING TO PASSAGES FROM THE DOCUMENT PUBLISHED IN LA REPUBLICA,
THE SHINING PATH "HAS REPORTEDLY GAINED CONTROL OVER AN IMPORTANT
SECTOR OF LIMA'S FOOD SUPPLY AND MARKETING NETWORK."

   OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE POINTED OUT THAT FARMER IN THE VALLEYS OF THE
PERUVIAN COAST AREA HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY "SHINING PATH PEOPLE" SO
THAT THEY NEITHER HARVEST NOR SELL THEIR PRODUCTS.  SIMILAR
INTIMIDATING ACTIONS ARE ALSO EXPECTED IN THE SIERRA VALLEYS AND THE
PERUVIAN JUNGLE AREA, THE SAME SOURCES NOTED.

   PERUVIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ALSO EXPECT THE TERRORISTS
TO TAKE DIRECT ACTION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS BY BURNING THE TRUCKS
THAT SUPPLY LIMA WITH FOODSTUFFS.

   THIS SABOTAGE, THE DOCUMENT POINTS OUT, "WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY
MASSIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM AIMED AT
REDUCING THE REFRIGERATED STORAGE CAPACITY OF LIMA'S MAIN FOOD
SUPPLIERS."

   THE REPORTS POINTS OUT THAT THE BOYCOTT OF THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS
WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A "SHINING PATH" CALL TO HOLD A "NATIONAL ARMED
STOPPAGE" FOR 12 NOVEMBER 1989, WHICH WILL SERVE AS A TRIAL FOR
SIMILAR ACTIONS IN THE APRIL 1990 GENERAL ELECTIONS.

   ELSEWHERE, A CAR BOMB EXPLODED LAST NIGHT IN THE TOWN OF BARRANCA,
LIMA DEPARTMENT, CLOSE TO WHERE FORMER EDUCATION MINISTER GROVER PANGO
IS STAYING.  FOUR PEOPLE WERE INJURED AND PROPERTY WAS DAMAGED.

   TERRORIST GROUPS ALSO BLEW UP SEVERAL HIGH-VOLTAGE TOWERS. A
BLACKOUT WAS REPORTED IN BARRANCA AND NEIGHBORING TOWNS.

   ACCORDING TO A REPORT PUBLISHED BY LA REPUBLICA, THE TERRORIST
ESCALATION BEGAN LAST FRIDAY [6 OCTOBER] IN LIMA AND TWO POLICEMEN
DIED IN THE TOWN OF CERRO BLANCO.

   IN HUANCAYO, THE CAPITAL OF JUNIN DEPARTMENT IN THE PERUVIAN
CENTRAL SIERRA, THE SANTA ISABEL HIGH SCHOOL HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF 10
BOMB ATTACKS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. THE ATTACKS HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN
PERPETRATED BY TERRORISTS WHO HAVE INFILTRATED THEMSELVES INTO THE
5,000 SANTA ISABEL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.  ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE HAS
BEEN REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACKS.

THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, AND PERU BEGAN
DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF OUSTING PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT
AND EVENTUALLY ACCEPTING ECUADOR IN ITS PLACE.  THE POSSIBILITY OF
EXPELLING PANAMA FROM THE GROUP WAS DISCUSSED EVEN THOUGH ARGENTINE
FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO SAID THE ISSUE WAS NOT ON THE AGENDA.

   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OUSTING OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT
AND REPLACING IT WITH ECUADOR, ARGENTINE FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO
CAVALLO TOLD EFE: "WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO THE PROPOSAL, BUT WE
PREFER NOT TO COMMENT FOR THE TIME BEING.  WE WILL SEE WITHIN THE
CONTEXT OF THE MEETING WHAT THE BASIS FOR THAT PROPOSAL IS."

   CAVALLO ADDED: "WE DO NOT HAVE PROPOSALS OR INITIATIVES ANY
DIFFERENT FROM THE ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED ON PANAMA."

   MEXICAN FOREIGN MINISTER FERNANDO SOLANA TOLD EFE THAT THE
PREPARATORY FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING WILL DISCUSS THE PANAMANIAN
ISSUE AND THAT MEXICO WILL DECIDE ITS STANCE "AT THE APPROPRIATE
TIME."

   BRAZILIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ROBERTO DE ABREU SAID IN THIS CITY
YESTERDAY THAT BRAZIL HAS AN INDIVIDUAL POSITION "BUT WILL ACCEPT AND
SUPPORT A JOINT AGREEMENT."

   PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX ALSO SAID YESTERDAY
THAT PERU WILL PROPOSE "THE FINAL SEPARATION OF PANAMA" FROM THE GROUP
OF EIGHT.

   LARCO ADDED THAT PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL PROPOSE THE SEPARATION
OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP DURING THE SUMMIT MEETING THAT WILL BE HELD
WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, URUGUAY,
AND VENEZUELA ON 11 AND 12 OCTOBER.  THE MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE IN
ICA, 850 KM SOUTH OF TRUJILLO.

   TODAY LARCO COX OPENED THE GROUP OF EIGHT FOREIGN MINISTERS'
MEETING IN TRUJILLO.  THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA
WERE ABSENT BECAUSE THEY WILL GO DIRECTLY TO ICA WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE
PRESIDENTS.

   IN A BRIEF SPEECH, LARCO COX CALLED ON THE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES TO
STRUGGLE FOR THE UNITY, INTEGRATION, AND INDEPENDENCE IN THE REGION.

   COX ADDED: "WE MUST WORK FOR OVERALL DEVELOPMENT. WE PROPOSE AS AN
ACT OF JUSTICE THE INTEGRATION OF THE CONTINENT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE."

   HE ADDED THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS CANNOT BE AN ISOLATED PROCESS
AND THAT UNITY CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVE IF THE COUNTRIES RESCUE THE
HISTORIC VALUES WHICH CONSOLIDATED THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE AMERICAS.

   THE MINISTERS ALSO DISCUSSED, IN ADDITION TO THE PANAMANIAN AND
ECUADORAN CASE, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM, JOINT ACTION TO DEAL
WITH THE REGION'S FOREIGN DEBT, ESTIMATED AT $420 BILLION, AND
TERRORISM.

   THE PROPOSALS MADE IN TRUJILLO WILL BE DISCUSSED BY THE SEVEN
PRESIDENTS IN ICA.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING IS BEING HELD UNDER POLICE AND
 MILITARY CONTROL TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS. ON 4 OCTOBER A CAR
BOMB EXPLODED ABOUT 500 METERS FROM THE MEETING SITE.  FORTUNATELY,
THERE WAS ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE.

   SOME OF THE SECURITY MEASURES INCLUDED THE CHANGE OF THE FOREIGN
MINISTERS' ARRIVAL TIMES AND SOME CHANGES IN THE OFFICIAL PROGRAM.

   THERE IS STRICT POLICE CONTROL NEAR THE CESAR VALLEJO CIVIC CENTER
WHERE THE MINISTERS ARE MEETING.  VEHICLE AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC WAS
PROHIBITED WITHIN ABOUT 200 METERS OF THE CENTER.

   THE FIRST MEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT WAS HELD IN ACAPULCO,
MEXICO, IN 1987, AND THE SECOND MEETING WAS HELD IN PUNTA DEL ESTE,
URUGUAY, IN 1988.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 10 OCT 89 (TELE-REBELDE NETWORK) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
COMMANDER GASPAR, RODRIGO ASTURIAS, MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, URNG, MILITARY DIRECTORATE BY UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] GREETINGS COMRADE. GUATEMALA ALWAYS COMES
UP IN CENTRAL AMERICAN NEWS.  WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT GUATEMALA.
INTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCIES BLOCK REPORTS FROM GUATEMALA .  WE HAVE
LEARNED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE ATMOSPHERE OF CHAOS AND INSTABILITY,
REPRESSION HAS INCREASED IN THE LAST 7 MONTHS.  IT WAS REPORTED
RECENTLY THAT 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED, 2,500 WOUNDED -- MANY OF
THEM CRIPPLED -- AND HUNDREDS -- OVER 800 ARE MISSING. WE HAVE TAKEN
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A VISIT PAID BY MR RODRIGO ASTURIAS, WHO IS MEMBER
OF THE URNG MILITARY DIRECTORATE AND IS ALSO KNOWN AS COMMANDER
GASPAR, NOT ONLY IN GUATEMALA AND CENTRAL AMERICA BUT THROUGHOUT THE
WORLD, TO TALK AND CLEAR SOME MATTERS PERTAINING TO GUATEMALA.

   COMMANDER GASPAR: SOME STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO FIND A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION. THAT IS, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE GUERRILLA AND THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT.  SOME JOURNALISTS AND
SPECIALISTS WONDER IF THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS
COMPATIBLE WITH THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN GUATEMALA. WHAT COULD YOU
TELL US ABOUT THIS?

   [ASTURIAS] I BELIEVE THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO
BE CLARIFIED. AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER, THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND MADE A
NEW PROPOSAL AIMED AT FINDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE INTERNAL
ARMED CONFLICT OUR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING. THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A
POLITICAL SOLUTION AND TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AS A FIRST STEP TO
CREATE THE CONDITIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ENTAILS AN
INCREASED EFFORT IN THE STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY. WE DO NOT THINK OF
DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION AS A DEMOBILIZATION ELEMENT BUT AS AN
EXTREMELY ACTIVE ELEMENT, AS A CLARIFYING ELEMENT, TO FIND AND PUT IN
PLACE CONSENSUS WITH DEMOCRATIC SOLUTIONS. THIS IS WHY ALTHOUGH THERE
HAS BEEN, IN FACT, AN INCREASE OF REPRESSION -- WHICH BY THE WAY, IT
WAS BRUTALLY INTENSIFIED LAST MONTH -- THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A
POLITICAL SOLUTION AND THE CALL ALL NATIONAL SECTORS, WITHOUT
EXCEPTION, TO BEGIN CONTACTS, TALKS, AND DIALOGUE WITH THE UNRG
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO REFUSE THEM AND
CONTINUES MAINTAINING A CLOSED POSITION. IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN
THE DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLE.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER GASPAR, INSISTING IN THE LAST PART OF YOUR
RESPONSE, WHAT ARE THE BASIS IN WHICH THIS TYPE OF TALKS AND DIALOGUE
COULD BE INITIATED?

   [ASTURIAS] SINCE OCTOBER 1987, WHEN ITS FIRST DIALOGUE INITIATIVE
WAS ESTABLISHED, THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS SAID PREESTABLISHED
CONDITIONS ARE NOT NECESSARY BUT THAT THE COUNTRY'S FUNDAMENTAL
PROBLEMS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIALOGUE AND THE PREPARATION OF THE
AGENDA. THE MAIN PROBLEM THE COUNTRY HAS AND HAS HAD IN THE LAST FEW
YEARS IS THE LACK OF RESPECT TOWARD HUMAN RIGHTS, THE MILITARIZATION
OF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIETY, AND THE GENERALIZED OPPRESSION EXPERIENCED.
THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THE MAIN POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE
AGENDA IS THE DEMOCRATIZATION.

   [REPORTER] SPEAKING OF THE INTERNAL SITUATION FROM THE MILITARY
POINT OF VIEW, NEWS AGENCY REPORT EVERY DAY OF MISSING PERSONS,
KILLINGS, AND TORTURES. ARE THE ONES EVERYONE KNOWS AS THE DEATH
SQUADRONS INCREASING THEIR ACTIVITIES?

   [ASTURIAS] INDEED, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION. WE
COULD SAY WITHOUT BEING MISTAKEN THAT THERE IS A TERRORIST ESCALATION
HEADED BY STATE SECURITY FORCES. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DENOUNCE AND
TO BE CLEAR ON THIS BECAUSE THE ONES THAT ARE CARRYING OUT THIS
REPRESSION AND THE ONES THAT ARE TAKING FORWARD THIS TERROR CAMPAIGN
ARE NOT PARAMILITARY GROUPS AS THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE AND
THEY ARE NOT EXTREME-RIGHT CIVILIAN GROUPS. THEY ARE ARMY OPERATIVE
GROUPS THAT ACT BASED ON INFORMATION, CHARGES, SUSPICIONS, OR MANY
TIMES BLINDLY TO SEE WHAT INFORMATION THEY CAN FIND, IN WHAT WAY THEY
CAN HIT OR INFILTRATE THE PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT.  WE ARE
FACED WITH AN ESCALATION OF THE STRONGEST STATE TERRORISM.  IT CANNOT
BE CONFUSED WITH DEATH SQUADRONS OR DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE RIGHT WING.
THE ARMY IS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE OF THE REPRESSION. [CONTINUED]

NATIONAL TERRITORY ON 8 OCTOBER RESULTED IN AT LEAST 8 KILLED AND MORE
THAN 20 INJURED, INCLUDING GUERILLAS AND SOLDIERS, A GOVERNMENT REPORT
SAID TODAY.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) SAID THAT AT LEAST FOUR
SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND EIGHT WERE WOUNDED WHEN THE REBELS AMBUSHED A
MILITARY TRUCK NEAR SAN VICENTE, 60 KM EAST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   IN ADDITION, TWO FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REBELS
WERE KILLED IN HEAVY FIGHTING IN CIUDAD BARRIOS, SAN MIGUEL
DEPARTMENT, THE REPORT ADDED.

   TWO MORE REBELS WERE KILLED AND AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF GUERRILLAS
AND SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED IN ARMED ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY'S EAST, THE
REPORT ALSO SAID.

   FINALLY, A STORE WAS PARTIALLY DESTROYED IN SAN SALVADOR ON THE

GUERRILLAS EXPLODED.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.

RAFAEL ABELLO SILVA, CHIEF OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTEL ON THE COAST
AND FOURTH MAN IN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS ARRESTED BY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, DAS, IN NORTHERN BOGOTA DURING
THE LAST FEW HOURS.  ABELLO IS WANTED BY A U.S. FEDERAL COURT IN
OKLAHOMA, THE UNITED STATES, FOR CONSPIRACY TO DISTRIBUTE DRUGS.
ACTIVE IN THE MARIJUANA BUSINESS DURING THE LAST DECADE AND IS NOW
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE
COCAINE WHICH THE MEDELLIN CARTEL SENDS TO THE UNITED STATES.

   AVELLO, 34, NATIVE OF SANTA MARTA, HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN EARLY 1988
FOR ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF WEAPONS ON THE ATLANTIC COAST.  SHORTLY
AFTER LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S ASSASSINATION, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ASKED FOR
HIS EXTRADITION, BEARING IN MIND THAT THE FEDERAL COURT IN OKLAHOMA IS
TRYING HIM FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING.  HIS EXTRADITION IS TAKEN FOR
GRANTYED, AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT IT WILL TAKE PLACE ONCE ALL LEGAL
REQUIREMENTS ARE MET, WHICH WILL NOT BE BEFORE 1 WEEK.

   DAS SOURCES SAID THAT MONO AVELLO OFFERED 100 MILLION PESOS TO THE
SIX DETECTIVES WHO ARRESTED HIM LAST NIGHT AT AN EXCLUSIVE RESTAURANT
IN BOGOTA'S NORTHERN SECTION.  THE AUTHORITIES HAD BEEN TRAILING HIM
IN BOGOTA FOR SEVERAL DAYS. THE ARMY HAS OCCUPIED SEVERAL OF HIS
PROPERTIES ON THE ATLANTIC COAST AND HAS SEIZED VEHICLES AND YACHTS
BELONGING TO HIM.

   IN ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT, IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT PERUVIAN JUSTICE
YESTERDAY INSISTED AGAIN ON THE EXTRADITION OF EVARISTO PORRAS ARDILA,
WHO ESCAPED FROM A JAIL IN PERU WHILE SERVING A SENTENCE FOR DRUG
TRAFFICKING. [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 OCT 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] SEVERAL
SALVADORAN SECTORS HAVE CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF THE WIFE OF THE DEPUTY
EDITOR OF EL DIARIO DE HOY.  SHE WAS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS NEAR THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY THIS MORNING.  SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS DESCRIBED THE ACTION AS TERRORIST.  HE SAID THIS
IS A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH WILL SURELY ALSO BE
CONDEMNED BY THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PASTOR
RIBREJO, WHO IS IN THE COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THE LAST STRAW IS THAT TERRORISTS,
WITHOUT ANY RISK TO THEMSELVES, KILL DEFENSELESS WOMEN.  THIS
PARTICULAR LADY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER CHILDREN, ONE OF WHOM WAS
WOUNDED.  WE THINK THIS IS THE LIMIT.  WE ARE NOT SURE WHO DID IT,
BUT, CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF THE ACTION, IT APPEARS TO BE A
TERRORIST CRIME.  WE ALREADY KNOW WHO PERPETRATES SUCH ACTIONS.  WE
THINK THIS IS PART OF WHAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] HAS BEEN DOING.  THEY HAVE BEEN SILENCING VOICES
THAT UPHOLD PHILOSOPHIES THAT RUN CONTRARY TO THEIR'S.  [END
RECORDING]

   REFERRING TO THE PRESENCE OF PASTOR RIBREJO IN THE COUNTRY,
CRISTIANI SAID THE UN OFFICIAL WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE POLICY
OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES DOES NOT FIT THE
VIOLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] I WILL NOT REFER TO MONSIGNOR ARTURO
RIVERA Y DAMAS ALONE, BUT TO ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LINKED TO THE
FMLN THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT.  I THINK DR
RIBREJO WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE
ARMED FORCES ARE IN THE HABIT OF VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS.  I THINK IF
ONE TRIES TO BE OBJECTIVE AND REALISTIC, HE WILL REALIZE THAT THE FMLN
HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE THE HOMELAND FALL INTO A STATE OF TOTAL
ANARCHY. I THINK THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ACTED VERY PROFESSIONALLY.  THE
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY HAS BEEN TO TRY TO SEEK SOLUTIONS THROUGH REASON
RATHER THAN VIOLENCE.  THESE EVENTS MUST BE SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT
THE FMLN SAID IT WOULD DO.  IT SAID IT WOULD UNLEASH EVEN GREATER
VIOLENCE. [END RECORDING]

   AS FOR THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE MEETING TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE ON 16
AND 17 OCTOBER, CRISTIANI SAID A COMMISSION IS READY TO RESUME TALKS
WITH THE FMLN, TO WHICH A CEASE-FIRE WILL BE PROPOSED, AMONG OTHER
THINGS. CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED
WORKING ON THE LOGISTICS OF THE MEETING SO THE TALKS CAN BE HELD IN
PEACE.

DEV-MUC3-0567 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   SANTIAGO, 10 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [EXCERPT] LUIS CORVALAN LEPE, THE
LEADER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE [PCCH] WHO TODAY RETURNED TO
CHILE AFTER 13 YEARS OF EXILE IN THE USSR, HAS EXPRESSED HIS SUPPORT
FOR OPPOSITION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, PATRICIO AYLWIN.

   ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE "MANUEL RODRIGUEZ
NATIONAL LIBERATION PATRIOTIC FRONT [FRENTE PATRIOTICO MANUEL
RODRIGUEZ DE LIBERACION NACIONAL]" (FMLN), [AS RECEIVED] WHICH IS
IDENTIFIED AS THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE PCCH, CORVALAN SAID THAT "FOR
ETHICAL AND MORAL REASONS, I CANNOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE
STRUGGLED AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP."

   IN 1986, THE FMLN TRIED TO KILL GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET AND
ILLEGALLY INTRODUCED A LARGE ARMS CACHE INTO THE COUNTRY.  ITS LEADERS
ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING A "PATRIOTIC WAR."  THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE AN ARMED STRUGGLE IF AYLWIN IS ELECTED.

   ADDRESSING JOURNALISTS AT THE SANTIAGO AIRPORT, CORVALAN SAID:
"VIOLENCE IS A SOCIAL FACTOR WHICH UNFORTUNATELY SOCIETY HAS BEEN
UNABLE TO OVERCOME."

   ASKED WHETHER HIS JUSTIFICATION OF VIOLENCE MAY HINDER AYLWIN'S
CANDIDACY, THE 73-YEAR OLD PCCH LEADER SAID HE DOES NOT BELEIVE THIS
WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE "AYLWIN'S CANDIDACY REPRESENTS THE EXPRESSION OF
ALL DEMOCRATIC TRENDS."

   CORVALAN ADDED: "AYLWIN IS A CONSENSUS CANDIDATE.  HE IS THE
CANDIDATE WHO SHOULD OBTAIN THE LARGEST SUPPORT UNDER THE CURRENT
CONDITIONS IN CHILE ON THE BASIS OF RESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL
POSITION OF EACH POLITICAL TREND."

   ABOUT THE CONTINUATION OF PINOCHET AS THE CHILEAN ARMY COMMANDER
AFTER THE ASSUMPTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, CORVALAN SAID: "IT
IS NOT PROPER FOR ONE PERSON TO GIVE ORDERS TO ANOTHER WHO WAS ELECTED
BY THE PEOPLE."

   CORVALAN SAID THAT THE OLD DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PCCH AND THE
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] HAVE BEEN OVERCOME BECAUSE "ALL OF US
HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YARS."

   HE ADDED THAT THE PCCH MEMBERS "ARE NOT THE SAME AS THEY WERE IN
1973.  WE ARE IMMERSED IN PERESTROIKA, AND THERE HAVE BEEN
CONSIDERABLE CHANGES."  HE ADDED: "THE PDC HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED
CHANGES SINCE 1973."  [PASSAGE OMITTED]


DEV-MUC3-0568 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BUENOS AIRES, 10 OCT 89 (TELAM) -- [TEXT] ARGENTINE FOREIGN
MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO AND HIS PERUVIAN COUNTERPART GUILLERMO LARCO
COX SIGNED THREE INTEGRATION AGREEMENTS TODAY IN TRUJILLO, LIBERTAD
DEPARTMENT.  CAVALLO SAID THAT THE AGREEMENTS "CLEARLY SHOW THE
EFFORTS BEING MADE TOWARD COMMON GOAL" WHICH MEANS "MOVING AHEAD TO
BUILD A GREAT LATIN AMERICAN NATION."

   THE AGREEMENTS, WHICH WERE PREPARED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRIES OF
THE TWO COUNTRIES, WERE SIGNED TODAY BY THE TWO FOREIGN MINISTERS IN
THE OLD HOUSE THAT BELONGED TO SIMON BOLIVIAR DURING THE TIME HE LIVED
IN TRUJILLO.  THE CEREMONY WAS HELD UNDER STRICT SECURITY MEASURES,
SEEKING TO PREVENT SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS.  SECURITY MEASURES WERE
REINFORCED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS FOLLOWING AN ATTACK EARLY THIS
MORNING 12 BLOCS FROM THE HOTEL WHERE THE DELEGATIONS ARE STAYING.

   THE FIRST AGREEMENT CREATES THE POLITICAL COORDINATION AND
INTEGRATION COMMITTEE.  CAVALLO SAID THAT THIS IS AIMED AT "TAKING
MORE ORDERLY STEPS IN THE EFFORTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY BECAUSE THE ARGENTINE AND PERUVIAN DESIRE FOR INTEGRATION HAS
ROOTS AS OLD AS THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE."

   THE SECOND AGREEMENT REFERS TO THE COORDINATION OF EFFORTS FOR THE
PREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  CAVALLO SAID: "THIS
PROBLEM IS REACHING TERRIFYING DIMENSIONS BECAUSE ITS ECONOMIC POWER
IS MIXED WITH TERRORIST AND SUBVERSIVE GROUPS.  AS SUCH IT IS BECOMING
A GROWING THREAT TO THE LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES."

   IN A BRIEF SPEECH CAVALLO ALSO REFERRED TO THE THIRD AGREEMENT TO
PREVENT DOUBLE TAXATION AMONG AIR AND MARITIME ENTERPRISES.  HE SAID:
"INTEGRATION REQUIRES GOOD TRANSPORTATION METHODS WITH WHICH TO BRING
PEOPLE CLOSER TOGETHER" THUS MAKING "PROGRESS THROUGH CONCRETE
MECHANISMS IN THE INTEGRATION PROCESS IN WHICH OUR COUNTRIES ARE
INVOLVED."

   LARCO COX SAID THAT THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS "ARGENTINE PRESIDENT
CARLOS MENEM HAS CONFIRMED, THROUGH HIS REPRESENTATIVE, HIS POLITICAL
WILL TO AGREE" TO FIND SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE REGION
BY SEEKING "NEW ROADS FOR UNDERSTANDING AND TO STRENGTHEN OUR ALREADY
RICH BILATERAL RELATIONS."

   A FEW HOURS BEFORE THIS CEREMONY, WHICH WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY UNDER
SECRETARY JOSE LUIS FERNANDEZ VALONI AND AMBASSADOR JULIAN LICASTRO,
TRUJILLO WAS SHAKEN AT 0400 BY FOUR POWERFUL DYNAMITE EXPLOTIONS (A
FIFTH BOMB DID NOT EXPLODE) WHICH DESTROYED ABOUT HALF DOZEN OFFICES
OF THE NATIONAL HOUSING ENTERPRISE.

   THIS ENTERPRISE, WHICH OPERATES WITH STATE AND PRIVATE CAPITAL, IS
LOCATED IN THE MONSERRATE DISTRICT WHERE THERE IS A HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT FOR POOR PEOPLE.  IT IS LOCATED 1 KM FROM THE PARADE
GROUND, DOWNTOWN TRUJILLO, ACROSS FROM WHICH IS LOCATED THE TURISTA
HOTEL.  THIS IS THE HOTEL WHERE THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA,
PERU, COLOMBIA, URUGUAY, BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA ARE STAYING.

   THE EXPLOSIONS DID NOT CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES AND THE POLICE HOLD THE
TUPAC AMARY REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK.

[CONTINUED] [BARCO] SECOND, MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ADOPTED MEASURES TO
CONFRONT ORGANIZED TERRORISM WHICH IS CONDUCTED BY DRUG CARTELS OR

DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THEY HAVE MURDERED JUDGES, A MINISTER OF JUSTICE, A

GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR AND THE RESPECTIVE AMBASSADORS.

   THIS SPECIAL ASSEMBLY DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY
COUNCIL SHOULD EXCLUDE WORLD SECURITY ISSUES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
[TELEVISION BROADCASTING INTERRUPTED FOR HALF A MINUTE DUE TO
TRANSMISSION PROBLESM]... WORLD DEVELOPMENT AND POLITICAL POWER. TO
THIS WE MUST ALSO ADD THE UNIFICATION OF THE EUROPE IN 1992. BESIDES,
THE SOVIET POLICIES OF PERESTROYKA AND GLASNOST HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY
MODIFIED NOT ONLY THE COMMUNIST IDEAS BUT ALSO THE FUTURE WORLD
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SCENE.

   THESE TRANSFORMATIONS ARE ATTRACTIVE FOR THE INDUSTRIALIZED
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THEY PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EASTERN EUROPE AND
PROBABLY REDUCE EUROPEAN INTEREST IN LATIN AMERICA. BESIDES, THE
UNITED STATES AND CANADA ARE PERMANENTLY MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD THEIR
SOCIOECONOMIC INTEGRATION.

   WE STAND BEFORE A DIFFERENT WORLD WHICH IS OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES
WHICH MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, BUT WHICH ALSO CREATES DIFFICULTIES
FOR WHICH WE MUST BE PREPARED.  LATIN AMERICA SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS
SITUATION AND POLICIES IN FACE OF THE RAPID WORLD CHANGES. WE MUST
ANALYZE THE WAY IN WHICH WE WILL INTEGRATE AND HARMONIZE OUR ECONOMIES
IN THIS NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SCENE.

   IN FACE OF THESE EVENTS, WE MUST REDEFINE OUR INTEGRATION FORMULAS
AND OUR DEVELOPMENT MODELS. I SUGGEST THAT A WORK GROUP BE FORMED TO
STUDY THIS SUBJECT AND TO ADOPT SPECIFIC MEASURES LEADING TO THE
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS OF LATIN AMERICA IN THIS NEW WORLD THAT
IS BEING BORN.

   MY DEAR PRESIDENTS AND FRIENDS, THIS NEW MEETING OF THE GROUP OF
EIGHT MUST MAKE US STRENGTHEN OUR SOLIDARITY IN FACE OF THE THREATS
AGAINST DEMOCRACY AND OUR SOCIAL PROGRESS. WE MUST STRENGTHEN THE
REGIONAL COOPERATION MECHANISM AND OUR NEGOTIATED CAPACITY THROUGH THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EFFICIENT STRATEGY OF CONSENSUS TO MAKE OUR
PROPOSALS MORE SOLID.

   WE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT ARE UNITED BY UNDENIABLE
HISTORIC TIES OF FRIENDSHIP. WE ARE ALSO UNITED BY STRATEGIC,
POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS WHICH MUST BE COORDINATED TO BE ABLE
TO SUCCESSFULLY FACE THE CHALLENGES OF TOMORROW.

   AS I RECENTLY TOLD MY VENEZUELAN COUNTERPART, UNITY CAN BE SOLIDLY
BUILT ON FEASIBLE INITIATIVES RATHER THAN ON WORDS. INTEGRATION
THRIVES ON ACHIEVEMENT THAT IN PRACTICE BRING PEOPLES TOGETHER AND
ALLOW THEM TO ENJOY THE RESULTS OF PROGRESS OBTAINED THROUGH COMMON
EFFORT. YEARS OF STRUGGLE FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT HAVE SHOWN US THAT
DEVELOPMENT MUST BE BASED ON ACTIONS THAT WILL GENERATE CONFIDENCE AND
WELL-BEING, CONTRIBUTE TO NATURALLY COMPLEMENTARY ACTIONS, AND SOLVE
SMALL AND LARGE PROBLEMS.

   COLOMBIA IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE STRENGTHENING THE MECHANISM OF
CONSENSUS BY ENDORSING THE SUGGESTIONS I HAVE MADE AND THOSE THAT WILL
SPRING FROM THIS SUMMIT MEETING.  THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE]
 

DEV-MUC3-0570 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 OCT 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] APPROXIMATELY 1,600
SALVADORANS HAVE VOICED THEIR DETERMINATION TO RETURN TO EL SALVADOR
ON 17 OCTOBER, WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL, AFTER HAVING
REMAINED AS REFUGEES IN A HONDURAN CAMP SINCE THE EARLY 80'S.

   "WE INSIST ON RETURNING TO EL SALVADOR ON 17 OCTOBER.  HERE, WE ARE
BEING IMPRISONED FOR NO REASON.  WE ARE LEAVING BECAUSE OTHERWISE, WE
WILL BE KILLED.  WE ARE SALVADORANS, AND THAT IS WHY WE WANT TO RETURN
TO OUR COUNTRY," SAID ONE OF THE REFUGEES IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW.

   INTERIOR MINISTER FRANCISCO MERINO WARNED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL
NOT ALLOW THE ENTRY OF REFUGEES WHO DO NOT HAVE IDENTIFICATION
DOCUMENTS ISSUED BY THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES [UNHCR].

   "IF THEY ARRIVE ABRUPTLY AT THE SALVADORAN BORDER, WITHOUT THE
DOCUMENTS THAT CERTIFY THEY ARE SALVADORANS, THEY CANNONT ENTER THE
COUNTRY," MERINO POINTED OUT.

   ACCORDING TO MERINO, WHO IS ALSO THE SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT, THE
REFUGEES' DETERMINATION TO RETURN WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL IS
"EVIDENCE" OF THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.

   HOWEVER, THE REFUGEES -- INCLUDING WOMEN, THE ELDERLY, AND CHILDREN
-- DENIED ANY LINKS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) GUERRILLAS.

   MERINO INTERPRETED THE REFUGEES' WISHES TO REPATRIATE IN A MASSIVE
AND IMMEDIATE MANNER AS "PLANS TO PROVOKE PROBLEMS THAT WILL AFFECT
THE IMAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH REGARD TO THE ISSUE OF RESPECTING
HUMAN RIGHTS."

   ON 10 OCTOBER, AN OFFICIAL COMMISSION, HEADED BY DEPUTY INTERIOR
MINISTER COLONEL CARLOS FIGUEROA VISITED THE HONDURAN CAMP AT MESA
GRANDE TO TRY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE REFUGEES SO THEY COULD
PREPARE FOR THEIR REPATRIATION IN 1990 AND AGREE ON THE PLACES WHERE
THEY WOULD BE RELOCATED.

   THE NATIONAL COMMISSION WAS UNABLE TO REACH ANY AGREEMENT FOR
POSTPONING THE REPATRIATION OF THE SALVADORANS TO 1990.

   THE MILITARY OFFICER DISCLOSED THAT THERE ARE LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS
IN PREPARING FOR THE 17 OCTOBER REPATRIATION.

   "THE UNHCR IS NOT PREPARED TO GIVE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE
SALVADORANS WHO WANT TO RETURN NEXT WEEK AND IT NEEDS FOR BOTH PARTIES
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REFUGEES) TO REACH AN AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO GO
AHEAD WITH THE REPATRIATION," COL FIGUEROA ADDED.

   ONE OF THE REFUGEES, WHO PREFERRED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED, CHARGED
THAT UNHCR "HAS BEEN UNABLE TO GIVE US TRANSPORTATION AND THE HONDURAN
ARMY IS NOT ALLOWING FOOD AND MEDICINE TO REACH US.  IN ADDITION, WE
ARE THE TARGET OF HONDURAN MILITARY ATTACKS."

   IN MESA GRANDE, THERE ARE 3,718 SALVADORANS, OF WHICH 900 ARE
CHILDREN.  THESE REFUGEES LEFT EL SALVADOR EARLY IN 1980 WHEN THE WAR
WHICH HAS LEFT OVER 70,000 DEAD BROKE OUT.

   THERE ARE ALSO AN ADDITIONAL 13,000 SALVADORANS IN MESA GRANDE WHO
WANT TO BE REPATRIATED, SAYS THE NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD ON
REFUGEES, THAT CLAIMS TO REPRESENT THEM.

   THE REFUGEES ARE DEMANDING THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT COMPLY WITH
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE SIGNED 2 YEARS AGO IN
GUATEMALA, WHICH -- ACCORDING TO THEM -- WOULD ALLOW THEM TO RETURN TO
THE COUNTRY WITH GUARANTEES.  


DEV-MUC3-0571 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   LIMA, 12 OCT 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
ARGENTINE PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [EXCERPTS]
[PASSAGE OMITTED] [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE GROUP OF
EIGHT REGARDING THE MALVINAS ISLANDS?  WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT SUPPORT
ARGENTINA IN THE DEFENSE OF ITS SOVEREIGNTY?

   [MENEM] THE GROUP OF EIGHT HAS SUPPORTED ARGENTINA FOR A LONG TIME,
SO HAS OAS AND THE UN.  THEIR SUPPORT IS UNQUESTIONABLE.

   [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [MENEM] CUBA MAY JOIN THE OAS.  WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO IT.  AS
FOR PANAMA, IT CONTINUES TO BELONG TO THE OAS BUT NOT TO THE GROUP OF
EIGHT.  PANAMA HAS BEEN SUSPENDED TEMPORARILY FROM THIS GROUP UNTIL
DEMOCRACY RETURNS TO THAT COUNTRY.  THIS WILL BE STATED IN A DOCUMENT
WE ARE PREPARING DURING THIS MEETING.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   [REPORTER] IS THE PARDON FOR MILITARY OFFICERS AND TERRORISTS IN
ARGENTINA DAMAGING THE MORAL HEALTH OF YOUR COUNTRY OR ARGENTINA
DEMOCRACY?

   [MENEM] NO, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME A PARDON HAS BEEN
GRANTED IN THE WORLD.  THERE HAVE BEEN PARDONS EVERYWHERE.  NOT LONG
AGO A PARDON WAS GRANTED IN URUGUAY AND IT HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY THE
URUGUAYAN PEOPLE.  A PARDON WAS GRANTED IN SPAIN AFTER THE [WORD
INDISTINCT].  THERE WERE PARDONS GRANTED AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR.
PARDONS AND FORGETTING HAVE ALLOWED THE INTEGRATION OF THE EUROPEAN
ECONOMIC COMMUNITY.  IT ALSO ALLOWED PRESIDENT BUSH TO PAY HOMMAGE TO
EMPEROR HIROITO, ONE OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECOND WORLD WAR,
DURING HIS FUNERAL.  THEREFORE WE CAN COMPLETELY OVERCOME THIS MATTER.

   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE OMITTED] REPORTED THAT ARGENTINA WOULD ASK TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE SUMMIT MEETING OF THE PRESIDENTS OF COLOMBIA, PERU,
AND BOLIVIA AND THE UNITED STATES.  IS THIS TRUE, AND WHAT WOULD BE
THE ARGENTINE ROLE IN THIS SUMMIT?

   [MENEM] NO, THAT IS NOT CORRECT.  WE SUPPORT THIS SUMMIT MEETING,
AND CONTINUE MAINTAINING OUR SAME ATTITUDE TOWARD THE FIGHT AGAINST
DRUG TRAFFICKING.  WE CURRENTLY DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN COCA
PRODUCER AND COCA CONSUMER COUNTRIES.  THEY ARE BOTH PART OF A SAME
PROCESS, SO WE MUST CARRY OUT AN ALL OUT WAR AGAINST THE THREE [AS
HEARD] PHASES OF DRUG PRODUCTION AND MERCHANDISING.

   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] A STRONGER ACTION IS REQUIRED BY
[WORD INDISTINCT] ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING.

   [MENEM] I THINK THAT WE NEED THE WILL OF EVERY ONE.  WE WOULD NOT
GAIN ANYTHING BY RESTRICTING THE PRODUCTION OF COCA IN PERU, COLOMBIA,
AND BOLIVIA IF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT HELP TO SUBSTITUTE THIS
CROP.  WE CANNOT DIVIDE THIS ACTION.  THE FIGHT MUST BE AN ALL OUT WAR
BY ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, BECAUSE DRUGS ARE CURRENTLY PRESENT
IN ALL COUNTRIES.  THERE IS NOT A SINGLE COUNTRY THAT CAN CLAIM THAT
THERE IS NO DRUG ADDICITON OR TRAFFICKING IN ITS TERRITORY.  NOT LONG
AGO, I READ THAT 14 DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE HANGED IN SAUDI ARABIA,
WHERE THEY ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE AND WHERE THERE IS STRICT CONTROL
OVER ANY KIND OF VICE.

   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] WHAT POSITION HAS ARGENTINA
MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THIS MEETING REGARDING THE FOREIGN DEBT ISSUE?
DO YOU THINK ALL THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEMBERS WILL ARRIVE TO A JOINT
POSITION REGARDING THIS ISSUE?

   [MENEM] WE ARE CURRENTLY RENEGOTIATING OUR DEBTS INDIVIDUALLY
BECAUSE EACH COUNTRY IS DIFFERENT. THE ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE SO FAR
NOT BEEN INTEGRATED BUT THEY MUST BE INTEGRATED. AS LONG AS WE DO NOT
ATTAIN INTEGRATION, THE FOREIGN DEBT NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT
INDIVIDUALLY.  IF WE MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS INTEGRATION, THINGS MAY
CHANGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL. FOR THE TIME BEING THE NEGOTIATIONS
WILL BE CARRIED OUT SEPARATELY.

   [REPORTER] PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA YESTERDAY CALLED FOR THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF CONCRETE INTEGRATION GOALS FOR 1992.  HAS THIS BEEN
DISCUSSED BY THE PRESIDENTS? WILL CONCRETE GOALS BE FIXED?

   [MENEM] WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS. WE HAVE ALREADY SET CONCRETE GOALS,
BASED ON EXPERIENCES. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH
BRAZIL, WHICH URUGUAY RECENTLY JOINED. THIS MUST SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE
FOR THE REST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. OF COURSE WE MUST NOT
FORGET SOME OF THE POSITIVE RESULTS, LIKE IN THE CASE OF THE ANDEAN
PACT WHICH IS REVIVING AND REORGANIZING ITSELF, AND OTHER AGREEMENTS
NOT ONLY IN LATIN AMERICA BUT IN THE WHOLE AMERICAN CONTINENT. WE ARE
HEADING TOWARD A CONTINENTAL UNITY LIKE THAT OF CANADA AND THE UNITED
STATES. AFTER LATIN AMERICA ACHIEVES INTEGRATION WE WANT INTEGRATION
WITH CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AMERICA. [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [MENEM] PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WAS SURPRISED, BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
THAT THE CREW OF THE THREE PLANES WE DONATED TO COLOMBIA HAD ALREADY
RETURNED TO ARGENTINA. HOWEVER, THEY ARE STILL THERE WAITING FOR THE
AIRPLANES TO BE PLACED AT THE SERVICE OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0572 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   LIMA, 12 OCT 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [PRESS CONFERENCE WITH
PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[REPORTER] THERE ARE SERIOUS DISCREPANCIES AMONG THE PREESIDENTS
ATTENDING TO THIS MEETING REGARDING THE FOREIGN DEBT ISSUE.  IS IT
BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS PREVAILING IN EACH COUNTRY?

   [GARCIA] WE HAVE A COMMON STANCE.  NO COUNTRY CAN PAY WHAT IT IS
BEING ASKED TO PAY.  WE ALL KNOW THIS.  PEOPLE KNOW IT.  THE LABOR
UNIONS KNOW IT.  THEREFORE, THAT IS OUR STANCE.

   A FEW YEARS AGO SOME COUNTRIES MADE AN EFFORT TO PAY.  NOWADAY,
EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY CANNOT PAY AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO CHANGE THE
PAYMENT CONDITIONS.  THIS IS THE BASIC ISSUE THAT WE ALL SHARE.

   THE FACT THAT SOME COUNTRIES RESORT TO THE BRADY PLAN, THAT OTHERS
SEEK OTHER ALTERNATIVES, OR THAT OTHERS CHOOSE NOT TO PAY A DEBT THAT
THEY CONSIDER TO BE UNFAIR -- AT LEAT UNTIL CONDITIONS CHANGE OR
PAYMENTS ARE REDUCED -- ARE SIMPLY DIFFERENT SHADES OF A COMMON
STANCE.  THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT WE ARE GRADUALLY VERIFYING THAT
NO COUNTRY IS ABLE TO PAY THE DEBT IN CONTRACTED, A DEBT THAT HAS
GROWN ONLY BECAUSE OF INTERESTS.

   I WILL REITERATE SOME DRAMATIC BUT REALISTIC FIGURES: 10 YEARS AGO
LATIN AMERICA OWED $190 BILLION.  IT PAID $289 BILLION TO DECEMBER
1988 -- THAT IS 10 YEARS -- AND IT STILL OWES $430 BILLION.  IN THE
PAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA HAS REDUCED ITS PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION
DRAMATICALLY BY 2 TO 3 PERCENT A YEAR.  IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN
AMERICA REDUCED ITS IMPORTS, SEEKING TO SPEND LESS DOLLARS.  IT
INCREASED ITS EXPORTS AND DEVALUED ITS CURRENCIES TO OBTAIN DOLLARS
WITH WHICH TO PAY THE DEBT.

   IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA GREW ONLY 1 PERCENT PER YEAR,
AND IT HAS USED THAT 1 PERCENT, PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 4-PERCENT OF ITS
GNP, TO PAY THE DEBT.

   THEREFORE, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, 10 YEARS LATER WE FIND THAT WE
OWE MORE, PRODUCE LESS, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY OUR DEBT.  WE ALL
KNOW THIS.  IT HAS COST US 10 YEARS TO UNDERSTAND IT.  HOWEVER IT IS
AN EXPERIENCE THAT CONSTITUTES THE BASE FOR OUR COMMON STANCE.

   [REPORTER] HAS PROGRESS BEEN MADE IN THIS FIELD SINCE THE PUNTA DEL
ESTE SUMMIT?

   [GARCIA] WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN A BRADY PLAN IF WE HAD NOT MET IN
ACAPULCO OR IN PUNTA DEL ESTE?  ONE OF JAMES BRADY'S ADVISERS
PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES STATING THAT THE BRADY PLAN
WAS ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER 1985 TO PREVENT THE DISSEMINATION OF THE
PERUVIAN ATTITUDE OF UNILATERALLY REDUCING ITS DEBT PAYMENTS.

   WHO KNOWS IF THE ACAPULCO AND PUNTA DEL ESTE MEETINGS HAVE NOT LED
THE CREDITORS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DEBT IS NOT WORTH ITS FACE VALUE
AND THAT IT MUST BE REDUCED?

   THEREFORE, THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS.  WHO KNOWS IF NEXT YEAR WE WILL
BE SPEAKING OF REDUCING THE DEBT BY 50 PERCENT AND NOT JUST THE 20
PERCENT THAT WE NOW SEEK?

   YOU SEE, THE FACT IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE UNABLE TO PAY AND THAT WE
ARE NEGOTIATING TO PAY LESS, BUT THE CREDITORS ALSO KNOW THAT THEY
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT THEIR MONEY IF THEY INSIST ON THEIR
CLAIMS.

   THEREFORE, IF THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION ARE HEADING TO
WARD DISARMAMENT, WHY CAN'T THERE BE A FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT BETWEEN
THE RICH AND POOR?  I THINK THAT ECONOMIC TRENDS WILL FOLLOW THIS
LINE.

   [REPORTER] PRESIDENT, WHY HASN'T PANAMA BEEN DEFINITIVELY EXPELLED
FROM THIS GROUP, AND WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT EXPAND?

   [GARCIA] PANAMA AS A COUNTRY, INDEPENDENT OF ITS PAST
ADMINISTRATIONS, WAS A FOUNDER MEMBER OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT.  NO
COUNTRY CAN BE EXPELLED.  THIS IS A TERM THAT WOULD OFFEND THE
CITIZENRY OF A COUNTRY.  WE SIMPLY RATIFIED THE SUSPENSION OF PANAMA
INDEFINITELY UNTIL PANAMA IS GOVERNED BY A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED
GOVERNMENT.  THAT WAS OUR DECISION.

   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] THE OAS?

   [GARCIA] WE ARE PREPARING A PROPOSAL IN WHICH WE STATE THAT THE OAS
IS AN IMPORTANT FORUM OR MECHANISM FOR HEMISPHERIC DIALOGUE BUT WHICH
MUST INCLUDE THE PRESENCE OF CUBA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH ARE YET
NOT MEMBERS.

   [REPORTER] WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT EXPAND?

   [GARCIA] I HOPE SO.  THIS IS THE LAST YEAR IN WHICH I WILL ATTEND A
MEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH I HELPED TO CREATE.  HOWEVER, I
HOPE THIS GROUP WILL LEAD ANNUAL AND PERIODICAL MEETINGS OF ALL LATIN
AMERICA PRESIDENTS.  I HAVE MAINTAINED THIS HOPE SINCE 1985.  I HOPE
THAT LATIN AMERICA WILL ANNUALLY COORDINATE SOME KIND OF COLLEGIAL
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS.  THE GROUP OF EIGHT IS
THE BEGINNING OF THIS, AND I AM SURE THAT IT WILL EXPAND IN THE
FUTURE.

   HOWEVER, AT A CONTINENTAL LEVEL, THE ISSUES CANNOT RUN AS FAST AS
FOR A COUNTRY, A PEOPLE, OR A POLITICAL PROCESS.  A CONTINENT REQUIRES
MUCH LONGER TERMS AND WE MUST BE PATIENT.  LET US GO TO ANOTHER
SUBJECT NOW.

   [REPORTER] HUMAN RIGHTS.  TWO OF THE MAIN ISSUES IN LATIN AMERICAN
LIFE ARE DEMOCRATIZATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  PRESIDENT MENEM HAS
RECENTLY PARDONED MILITARY OFFICERS AND TERRORISTS WHO WERE SERVING
PRISON SENTENCES.  THERE IS ALSO A CONFLICTIVE SITUATION IN PERU
REGARDING SOME MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE BEING TRIED FOR MURDERS
COMMITTED IN JAILS.  ARE YOU WILLING TO PARDON THOSE MILITARY OFFICERS
TO PACIFY THE SITUATION?  THIS IS MY FIRST QUESTION.

   SECOND, THE PERUVIAN IMAGE THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA IS VERY
BAD BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INFORMATION.  IN CONTRAST WITH ACAPULCO AND
PUNTA DEL ESTE, WHICH ARE HOLIDAY RESORTS WITH MULTIMILLION DOLLAR
INFRASTRUCTURES, THE CITY OF ICA REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF LATIN
AMERICAN CITIES.  THEREFORE, WHAT IS YOUR ADMINISTRATION DOING TO
THRUTHFULLY REPORT ON PERUVIAN REALITY?  TION DOING TO THRUTHFULLY
REPORT ON PERUVIAN REALITY?  [CONTINUED]

   THUS, THE FRENCH AID TO ECUADOR IN 1989 WILL TOTAL 400 MILLION
FRANCS, SINCE FRANCE PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO GRANT LOANS FOR 180 MILLION
FRANCS TO ECUADOR.

   THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE ON 12 OCTOBER, SHORTLY BEFORE MITTERRAND
CONCLUDED HIS OFFICIAL 2-DAY VISIT TO ECUADOR, WHERE HE HELD A PRIVATE
MEETING WITH BORJA -- A FELLOW MEMBER OF SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL --
AFTER ECUADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER DIEGO CORDOVEZ AND EDWIGE AVICE,
DELEGATE FROM THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SIGNED AN LETTER
OF INTENTION.

   FROM THE TOTAL LOANS, 165 MILLION FRANCS WILL BE USED FOR THE FIRST
PHASE OF A PROJECT TO REHABILITATE THE CENTRAL RAILROAD.  THE PROJECT
INCLUDES THE REHABILITATION OF 900 KM OF THE RAILWAY LINE BETWEEN THE
ECUADORAN MOUNTAIN RANGE AND THE ECUADORAN COAST, BORJA SAID.  HE
REVEALED THAT THE LOAN IS TO BE PAID BACK IN 25 YEARS, WITH A 5-YEAR
GRACE PERIOD AND LOW INTEREST RATES.  HE ALSO NOTED THE SOCIAL
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT, IN A COUNTRY WITH DIFFICULT AND RUGGED
TERRAIN.  THE REMAINING FUNDS WILL BE USED TO SUPPLY POTABLE WATER TO
THE PROVINCES OF IMBABURA IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE, AND MANABI IN THE
COASTAL REGION.

   WITH REGARD TO ECUADOR'S FOREIGN DEBT, WHICH EXCEEDS $11 BILLION,
MITTERRAND SAID HE IS "WILLING TO PERSONALLY ASSIST," IN THE STUDY OF
BILATERAL AGREEMENTS TO REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN, AND TO INTERCEDE
BEFORE THE PARIS CLUB, TO WHICH ECUADOR OWES $400 MILLION.

   MITTERRAND ASKED BORJA TO GIVE HIM TIME TO STUDY THE BILATERAL
AGREEMENTS ON THE DEBT.  IN THIS REGARD, MITTERRAND CLEARLY EXPRESSED
THAT THE DEBT WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN.  HE BELIEVES THIS IS AN OVERALL
PROBLEM AND IS "MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE ATOMIC BOMB," BECAUSE THE
COUNTRIES FACING THIS PROBLEM CANNOT CONTROL IT."  AT THE SAME TIME,
MITERRAND ASKED: "WHO CAN CONTROL THE MISERY AND THE DISTURBANCES"
THIS PROBLEM WILL GENERATE?

   MITTERRAND ADDED THAT EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO IMPROVE THE WEAK
BILATERAL TRADE, WHICH IN 1988 TOTALLED 321.3 MILLION FRANCS ($50.6
MILLION), WITH A DEFICIT OF 56.5 MILLION FRANCS FOR ECUADOR ($8.9
MILLION).

   MITTERRAND SAID FRENCH EXPERTS WILL STUDY THE POSSIBILITY OF
BOOSTING SALES OF ECUADORAN PRODUCTS TO FRANCE, ESPECIALLY SEAFOOD
PRODUCTS, SUCH AS SHRIMP, AS WELL AS BANANAS, WHICH FRANCE CURRENTLY
BUYS FROM AFRICAN COUNTRIES.  "WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS OPEN NEW DOORS,"
MITTERRAND ADDED.  HOWEVER, HE INSISTED ON THE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE
STUDIES THE EXPERTS WILL CARRY OUT.

   THE CHIEFS OF STATE ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A COOPERATION
AGREEMENT TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, STILL AT AN EARLY
STAGE IN ECUADOR.  THROUGH THIS AGREEMENT, SIGNED BY ECUADORAN
GOVERNMENT MINISTER ANDRES VALLEJO AND FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER PIERRE
JOXE, A PLAN WILL BE DRAFTED TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS SCOURGE.  FRANCE
WILL PROVIDE ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AND OTHER SUPPLIES TO THE ECUADORAN
POLICE.

   MITTERRAND SAID HE THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED THIS PROBLEM WITH BORJA,
ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT A SPECIFIC PROBLEM OF ECUADOR, WHICH IS NOT A
PRODUCING COUNTRY, BUT IS USED FOR THE TRANSSHIPMENT OF DRUGS.  HE
MADE AN APPEAL TO ORGANIZE A WORLD FRONT TO ELIMINATE THIS SCOURGE.

   BORJA CONFIRMED MITTERRAND'S STATEMENTS AND ADDED THAT ALTHOUGH
ECUADOR "IS NOT A DRUG-PRODUCING COUNTRY, WE WILL NOT REST," BECAUSE I
BELIEVE OTHER COUNTRIES "BEGAN LATE" IN THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS
EVIL.

   THE TWO PRESIDENTS AGREED ON THE NEED TO CONCERTED EFFORTS -- AMONG
COUNTRIES PRODUCING AND CONSUMING DRUGS, COUNTRIES USED FOR THE
TRANSSHIPMENT OF DRUGS, AND FOR MONEY LAUNDERING -- TO FACE THIS
SCOURGE.  THE TWO PRESIDENTS COMMITTED THEIR EFFORTS IN THIS RESPECT.

   MITTERRAND, WHO UPON CONCLUDING HIS VISIT TO ECUADOR WILL MAKE A
STOPOVER IN BOGOTA, SAID THAT HIS UNSCHEDULED VISIT TO COLOMBIAN
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IS "TO GIVE OPEN TESTIMONY ON THE SOLIDARITY
THAT MUST BE GIVEN TO THE PRESIDENT OF SUCH A COURAGEOUS GOVERNMENT.

   FINALLY, MITTERRAND NOTED THE BENEFITS OF HIS VISIT TO ECUADOR --
WHICH HE EXPECTS TO REPEAT -- AND THE ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOMING HE
RECEIVED.  BORJA THANKED THIS "GREAT EUROPEAN AND WORLD LEADER, WHO IS
OFFERING HIS FRIENDSHIP TO US," FOR HIS VISIT.

   BOGOTA, 14 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE WAVE OF CRIMINAL ATTACKS TO
WHICH COLOMBIAN JOURNALISTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING SUBJECTED CONTINUED
LAST NIGHT WHEN WILLIAM BENDECK OLIVELLA, DIRECTOR OF A RADIO NEWSCAST
IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF MONTERIA, WAS KILLED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS RECEIVED IN BOGOTA, THE NEWSMAN, 57, WAS ABOUT
TO ENTER HIS HOME WHEN HE WAS GUNNED DOWN BY SEVERAL ARMED MEN.

   BENDECK OLIVELLA HAD BEEN PRESS ASSISTANT TO NICARAGUAN DICTATOR
ANASTASIO SOMOZA, BUT WENT TO COLOMBIA AFTER THE TRIUMPH OF THE
SANDINIST REVOLUTION.

   BENDECK OLIVELLA IS THE SECOND NEWSMAN TO BE MURDERED THIS WEEK.
ON TUESDAY, SEVERAL GUNMEN KILLED ROBERTO SARASTY BOTERO, WHO WORKED
FOR THE CARACOL RADIO NETWORK IN MEDELLIN.

   ALTHOUGH THE AUTHORITIES DO NOT YET HAVE DETAILED INFORMATION, THE
POSSIBILITY THAT BENDECK OLIVELLA MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR POLITICAL
REASONS HAS NOT BEEN RULED OUT SINCE HE WAS A POLITICAL SPECIALIST.

   FOR MORE THAN A MONTH, NEWSMEN IN COLOMBIA HAVE BEEN FACING A
SERIOUS THREAT FROM THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA, WHICH EVEN PARTIALLY
DESTROYED THE MAIN OFFICES OF THE BOGOTA MORNING PAPER EL ESPECTADOR,
IN REPRISAL FOR THE PAPER'S HARSH ATTACKS ON THE COCAINE TRAFFICKING
ORGANIZATIONS.


DEV-MUC3-0576 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 12 OCT 89 (RADIO MAGALLANES) -- [COMMENTARY]
[CHILEAN JOURNALIST ROLANDO CARRASCO] [TEXT] WE HAD BEEN LEFT
COMPLETELY ALONE AND ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD, THE POPULAR GOVERNMENT
HAD BEEN OVERTHROWN, THE DICTATORSHIP HAD SCATTERED CONCENTRATION
CAMPS AND ANONYMOUS DEAD AROUND THE COUNTRY, CONGRESS WAS CLOSED, ALL
LEFTIST COMMUNICATION MEDIA WERE ALSO CLOSED, AND THE IMAGE OF THE
DICTATORSHIP MONOPOLIZED THE TELEVISION SCREENS.  PINOCHET NEEDED TO
BE LEFT ALONE IN ORDER TO CONSOLIDATE HIS POWER BY MURDERING HIS
OPPONENTS.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE SENT MISSIONS ABROAD TO SEEK
RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT.

   IN THE FIRST DAYS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COUP, RADIO MOSCOW BEGAN TO
BEAM PROGRAMS TO CHILE, AND I AM NOW TALKING TO YOU FROM ITS STUDIOS.
VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, CURRENT SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST
PARTY, WAS BY CHANCE IN MOSCOW IN SEPTEMBER 1973, AND IT FELL TO HIM
TO INITIATE THE PROGRAMS "LISTEN, CHILE" [ESCUCHA, CHILE] AND RADIO
MAGALLANES OVER THE MICROPHONES OF RADIO MOSCOW.  THE AUDIENCE OF
THESE PROGRAMS SUDDENLY GREW INSIDE CHILE.

   AT FIRST, THE PROGRAMS DENOUNCED THE ARBITRARY ACTION OF THE
MILITARY REGIME.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SMUGGLE NEWS OUT OF CHILE SO
THAT IT COULD BE BROADCAST ALL OVER CHILE BY RADIO MOSCOW, BUT NEWS OF
THE WORLD'S SOLIDARITY WAS BROADCAST NIGHT AFTER NIGHT TO CHILE.
THUS, THE WALL OF SILENCE THE DICTATOR INTENDED TO RAISE AROUND HIM TO
HIDE HIS CRIMES WAS CRACKED.

   A TRADITION OF LISTENING RADIO MOSCOW PROGRAMS TO LATIN AMERICA WAS
DEVELOPED IN CHILE AS ATTESTED BY THE MAIL THAT REACHED ITS STUDIOS.
THE BULK OF MAIL FROM CHILE CONFIRMS THIS.  SO IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT
THE MOSCOW TRANSMISSIONS WERE HELPING THE CAUSE OF THE PERSECUTED, THE
WORKERS, THE STUDENTS, THE PRISONERS, THE MUZZLED DEMOCRATS, AND THE
GRIEVING WIDOWS OF CHILE.  THROUGH THESE TRANSMISSIONS, THOSE PEOPLE
RECEIVED THE MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AN ENCOURAGEMENT SENT BY THE PEOPLES
OF THE WORLD.

   THE FIRST BROADCASTS WERE MADE IN THOSE YEARS, AND VERY FEW HAVE
NOT LISTENED TO THEM AT SOME TIME, ALTHOUGH NOBODY ADMITTED TO
KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PROGRAMS.  THE TYRANT HIMSELF VIOLENTLY ATTACKED
THE PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL PUBLIC SPEECHES.  NOT LONG AGO, PINOCHET'S
FOREIGN MINISTER AGAIN SCATHINGLY REFERRED TO RADIO MOSCOW'S
BROADCASTS.  THAT IS TO SAY THAT THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE CONTINUED TO
AFFECT THE DICTATORSHIP IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THAT THEY HAVE
HELPED THE RESURGENCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES.  THE RESURGENCE AND
ORGANIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES THROUGH THE IMPETUS OF THE
WORKERS AND BROAD SECTORS OF THE POPULATION HAVE RESHAPED THE CHILEAN
POLITICAL SITUATION, TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE NOW APPROACHING THE REAL
POSSIBILITY OF AN ELECTORAL TRIUMPH BY A SINGLE OPPOSITION CANDIDATE
TO THE PRESIDENCY, THUS SETTING THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION IN MOTION.

   IN FACT THE SITUATION NOT ONLY HAS CHANGED IN CHILE, BUT ALSO IN
THE SOVIET UNION WHERE THE PERESTROYKA -- A REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS
INSIDE A REVOLUTION -- HAS OPENED IMMENSE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOVIET SOCIETY.  WE
FREQUENTLY KEEP YOU ABREAST OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROGRAMS OF
RADIO MOSCOW.  SO, ALL THIS HAS GALVANIZED OUR DISPOSITION TO CONTINUE
COOPERATING IN THIS PROCES THAT HAS REACHED NEW LEVELS.

   OUR PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE OPEN AND AT THE DISPOSAL OF ALL ADVANCE
FORCES THAT MARCH WITH THE DEMOCRATS.  A FEW WEEKS AGO, RADIO MOSCOW
COMPLETED 16 YEARS OF BROADCAST TO CHILE.  NOW, ON 29 OCTOBER RADIO
MOSCOW WILL CELEBRATE ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY.  ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE
WORLD KNOW THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW IN 81 LANGUAGES.  THE PROGRAMS
TO CHILE HAVE A PRIVILEGED PLACE AMONG THEM.  FOR THE OCCASION,
GREETINGS HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW AND RADIO
MAGALLANES.  FROM CHILEANS SCATTERED IN 40 COUNTRIES BY THE FASCIST
EXPLOSION, RADIO MOSCOW ALSO RECEIVES MAIL AND POSTCARD WITH MESSAGES
OF APPRECIATION AND THANKS.  THIS IS A MODEST WAY OF RESPONDING TO THE
VALUABLE ASSISTANCE RADIO MOSCOW HAS GIVEN, IS GIVING, AND WILL
CONTINUE TO GIVE US.

   WE HAD BEEN LEFT ALONE, ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD, AND RADIO MOSCOW
PROVED TO BE OUR FRIEND DURING SHAMEFUL TIMES.  GOOD NIGHT.  


DEV-MUC3-0577 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   LIMA, 15 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] VICTOR POLAY, THE LEADER OF THE
PERUVIAN TERRORIST TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA) GROUP,
TODAY ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE MRTA WILL PROPOSE HIS RELEASE
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RELEASE OF TELEVISION IMPRESARIO HECTOR DELGADO
PARKER.  POLAY IS BEING HELD AT A PENITENTIARY IN LIMA.

   THE REMARKS BY POLAY, WHO WAS CAPTURED BY PERUVIAN POLICE IN
FEBRUARY 1989 IN THE CITY OF HUANCAYO, 315 KM EAST OF LIMA, WERE
PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIMA DAILY "LA REPUBLICA," WHICH INTERVIEWED
HIM AT HIS CELL IN LIMA'S CANTO GRANDE PENITENTIARY.

   LAST THURDAY [12 OCTOBER], THE WEEKLY "CAMBIO," WHICH IS DESCRIBED
BY POLICE SOURCES AS THE MRTA'S UNOFFICIAL MOUTHPIECE, REPORTED THAT
THE MRTA -- WHICH UPHOLDS THE BELIEFS OF GUERRILLA ERNESTO "CHE"
GUEVARA -- KIDNAPPED IMPRESARIO DELGADO PARKER ON 4 OCTOBER 1989 IN
LIMA, SAYING THAT HE WILL BE TRIED "BY A REVOLUTIONARY COURT."

   DELGADO PARKER WAS AN ADVISER TO PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND
IS THE GODFATHER OF ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS.

   POLAY TOLD "LA REPUBLICA" THAT THE KIDNAPPING OF THE IMPORTANT
PERUVIAN TELEVISION IMPRESARIO IS OF A"POLITICAL" NATURE AND IS
DIFFERENT FROM OTHER KIDNAPPINGS OF OTHER PROMINENT TYCOONS CARRIED
OUT BY THE MRTA PEOPLE TO OBTAIN RANSOM MONEY, AND THAT, THEREFORE,
THE PETITION THAT WILL BE MADE "MUST BE POLITICAL."

   POLAY TOLD "LA REPUBLICA" THAT HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DELGADO
PARKER'S KIDNAPPING, A BLOODY ACTION IN WHICH THE IMPRESARIO'S DRIVER
WAS KILLED AND THE IMPRESARIO'S BODYGUARD WAS INJURED.  POLAY SAID
THAT HE CANNOT PREDICT THE DECISION THAT THE "REVOLUTIONARY COURT"
WILL MAKE AFTER THE "PEOPLE'S JUDGMENT" TO WHICH THE IMPRESARIO WILL
BE SUBJECTED.

   POLAY, HOWEVER, ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EXCHANGE DEAL
BECAUSE "THE KIDNAPPING IS POLITICAL AND THE PETITION THAT WILL BE
MADE MUST BE POLITICAL."

   THE PUBLICATION OF POLAY'S INTERVIEW TODAY COINCIDES WITH REPORTS
BY LOCAL NEWSPAPERS ON THE CAPTURE OF 12 REGIONAL MRTA LEADERS.  THIS
NEWS WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE CITY OF CAJAMARCA, 870 KM NORTH OF LIMA.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE OPERATIONS, LEADING TO
THE CAPTURE OF THE MRTA LEADERS, HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT OVER THE PAST
FEW DAYS, AND THAT ACTIVISTS, WHO WERE OPERTING IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF
CAJAMARCA, LA LIBERTAD, AND ANCASH IN NORTHERN PERU AND WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST 20 BOMB ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, HAVE
BEEN DETAINED.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE ADDED THAT FIREARMS, EXPLOSIVES, AND PROPAGANDA
MATERIAL WERE SEIZED FROM THE MRTA LEADERS.

[PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ] [TEXT] IT IS A PLEASURE FOR ME TO MEET
WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO FOR THE SECOND TIME, IN MY ROLE AS
PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA, TO TO CONTINUE REVIEWING -- 6 MONTHS LATER --
ISSUES WHICH ARE OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO OUR TWO NATIONS.  I ALSO WISH
TO PROVE WITH THIS ACTION THAT WE ARE WILLING TO CARRY OUT OUR PLANS
FOR COOPERATION AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING.  ON THIS OCCASION WE ARE
PROVING THAT WE WANT TO PERMANENTLY FOLLOW UP THE GOALS ESTABLISHED
DURING OUR FIRST MEETING.

   HOWEVER, PRESIDENT BARCO, ON THIS OCCASION I WISH TO STATE -- LIKE
I PERSONALLY TOLD YOU ON THE TELEPHONE UPON LEARNING THE UNFORTUNATE
AND TRAGIC NEWS ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN, AN
ADMIRED FRIEND AND A GREAT COLOMBIAN -- THAT I WANTED TO HOLD THIS
MEETING BECAUSE THE VENEZUELAN FEELINGS WHICH I REPRESENT AND
PERSONIFY COMPELLED ME TO PERSONALLY EXPRESS TO YOU, AS PRESIDENT OF
COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA'S AND THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE'S SOLIDARITY WITH THE
EXTRAORDINARY AND ADMIRABLE STRUGGLE THAT COLOMBIA IS CURRENTLY WAGING
AGAINST AN ENEMY OF MANKIND -- DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   I WANT TO STATE HERE THAT THIS WAS ENOUGH REASON FOR THE VENEZUELA
GOVERNMENT TO REQUEST, THROUGH ITS PRESIDENT, A PERSONAL INTERVIEW
WITH PRESIDENT BARCO SO THAT IT MAY BE KNOWN THAT VENEZUELA'S
SOLIDARITY GOES BEYOND WORDS.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 16 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [EXCERPTS] A DARK CLOUD
OF SKEPTICISM LOOMED OVER THE TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AT THE END OF
THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS TODAY, BECAUSE THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE
DIALOGUE WERE UNABLE, REPEAT UNABLE, TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THE BASIC
POINTS FOR A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE.

   THE DELEGATIONS MET AT THE PASTORAL HOUSE OF THE CLARIST NUNS'
CONGREGATION IN MORAVIA, 4 KM FROM SAN JOSE.

   OSCAR ARIAS, THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT AND NOBEL PEACE PRIZE
WINNER, VISITED THE PLACE AND ENCOURAGED THE PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEET
"BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN WAR IS SENSELESS AND SHOULD NOT, REPEAT SHOULD
NOT, CONTINUE."

   ARIAS ADDED: "I KNOW OF NOTHING THAT IS BETTER THAN DIALOGUE."

   GREGORIO ROSAS CHAVEZ, THE AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR,
STATED: "I FOSTER HOPES THAT AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED."

   WHEN THE MEETING STARTED AND, AFTER THE INITIAL FORMALITIES, THE
REPRESENTATIVES BEGAN TO DISCUSS THE KEY POINTS.

   THE FMLN PROPOSED THE FOLLOWING POINTS AT THE MEETING:

   1. THE NEED TO ADVANCE THE DATE OF THE GENERAL ELECTIONS;

   2. THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONSIGNIOR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S
MURDER TO BE SENT TO TRIAL;

   3. REFORMS TO THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION;

   4. PURGING AND PROFESSIONALIZING THE ARMY;

   5. ENDING REPRESSION;

   6. FULL ENFORCEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS;

   7. REFORMS TO THE SALVADORAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM;

   8. PROVISIONAL ECONOMIC MEASURES TO DEACTIVATE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL
CONFRONTATION.

   IN SYNTHESIS, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSED "STOPPING
HOSTILITIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE OAS AND
UN DELEGATES."

   JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ, HEAD OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION, ALSO PROPOSED THAT "FMLN MEMBERS BE GIVEN ALL THE REQUIRED
FACILITIES TO RETURN TO SALVADORAN POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC
LIFE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER A CEASE-FIRE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED."

   AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS WAS OVER, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, ONE OF
THE LEADERS OF THE FMLN DELEGATION, SAID: "WE REACHED NO SPECIFIC
ACCORDS."

   ANOTHER FMLN LEADER SHAFICK HANDAL POINTED OUT THAT "THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO US FOR THE TIME BEING."

   REPRESENTING THE GOVERNMENT, SALVADORAN JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR
SANTAMARIA SAID: "WE MADE LITTLE PROGRESS; THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS A
SPECIFIC POSITION ON HOW TO ACHIEVE A CEASE-FIRE, WHICH IS WHAT THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING."

   AT THE END OF THE FIRST ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE, THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ARE DEADLOCKED ON AN ESSENTIAL ISSUE -- THE
CEASE-FIRE.

   THE FMLN MAINTAINS THAT A CEASE-FIRE SHOULD FOLLOW GOVERNMENT
COMPLIANCE WITH A NUMBER OF MEASURES WHILE THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
 MAINTAINS THAT A CEASE-FIRE MUST COME BEFORE ANY CHANGES TAKE PLACE.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CATEGORICALLY
REJECTED AN FMLN PROPOSAL TO HOLD NEW ELECTIONS SOON.

   THE FMLN ALSO CATEGORICALLY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S CEASE-FIRE
PROPOSAL, BECAUSE THAT "WOULD CONSTITUTE SURRENDER."

   "WE WANT A CEASE-FIRE, BUT THEY MUST COMPLY WITH CERTAIN STEPS THAT
WE ARE PROPOSING," COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS SAID.

   "WE WANT A CEASE-FIRE FIRST AND THEN NEGOTIATIONS," SALVADORAN
PRESIDENCY MINISTER JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ SAID.

   THE SECOND ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE WILL TAKE PLACE ON 17 OCTOBER AT
1400 GMT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 OCT 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT] [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL
SALVADOR STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE BASE AND COWARDLY MURDER OF MS DOLORES
ISABEL CASANOVA PORRAS, CARRIED OUT THIS MORNING BY FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS IN SANTA TECLA AS THE
INNOCENT VICTIM WAS ON HER WAY TO HER SPORTS EXERCISES.  THIS CRIME,
VICIOUSLY AND COLDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN, CLEARLY SHOWS THE WORLD
THE FMLN IS AN ORGANIZATION LED AND MADE UP BY INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM
HUMAN LIFE MEANS NOTHING.

   THIS DESPICABLE CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST MS CASONOVA PORRAS
CONFIRMS THE FMLN IS IMPLEMENTING A DEATH-LIKE TERRORIST PLAN THAT
INCLUDES THE MURDER OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND THEIR RELATIVES, AS THE
PRESIDENT PUBLICLY CHARGED ON 14 OCTOBER.  CONDEMNING THIS NEW CRIME
BY FMLN URBAN CELLS, THE GOVERNMENT ASKS: HOW CAN FMLN LEADERS IN
COSTA RICA TALK OF PEACE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN DEFENSELESS
PERSONS ARE BEING RUTHLESSLY AND IRRATIONALLY MURDERED ON ORDERS FROM
THE FMLN?

   THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY CONVEYS ITS DEEP CONDOLENCES AND SOLIDARITY
TO MS CASANOVA PORRAS' FAMILY OVER THIS IRREPARABLE LOSS. MOREOVER, IT
ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF NATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS
RAPPORTEUR PROFESSOR PASTOR RIDREJO TO TAKE DUE NOTICE OF THIS
DESPICABLE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN AT A TIME
WHEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IS ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE IN
GOOD FAITH AND WITH THE BEST POLITICAL INTENTIONS TO REACH PEACE,
SOMETHING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE YEARN FOR.

   THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE FMLN RESPONSIBLE FOR JEOPARDIZING THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS TO REACH PEACE, AND HOPES THAT THE FMLN ADOPTS A
RESPONSIBLE STAND AND THAT ITS PEACEFUL WORDS ARE MATCHED BY DEEDS.


DEV-MUC3-0581 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   SAN JOSE, 17 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] NO CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT WAS
REACHED AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE CURRENT ROUND OF
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN DELEGATES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.

   THE DELEGATIONS MET IN THE PASTORAL HOUSE OF THE CONGREGATION OF
THE NUNS OF ST CLARE IN MORAVIA, 4 KM FROM SAN JOSE.

   DURING THE DIALOGUE, THE DELEGATES BECAME INVOLVED IN A DISCUSSION
ON IMPLEMENTATION OF A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE AND THE FMLN INSISTED THAT
THERE MUST FIRST BE APPROVAL OF A PLAN TO AMEND THE SALVADORAN
CONSTITUTION, THAT THE ARMY BE PURGED, THAT THE REPRESSION END, THAT
MODIFICATIONS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BE STARTED, AND THAT MEASURES BE
ADOPTED TO GUARANTEE THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION.

   FOR THEIR PART, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES INSISTED THAT
THE FMLN MUST DECLARE AN IMMEDIATE HALT TO HOSTILITIES EFFECTIVE 18
OCTOBER.

   THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL INDICATED THAT "IT COMMITS ITSELF TO HALT
ALL OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS AND TO OFFER GUARANTEES TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS
OF ALL GUERRILLAS SO THAT THEY CAN JOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL,
SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC LIFE."

   FMLN COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS SAID: "WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE
GOVERNMENT'S CONDITIONS FOR THE CEASE-FIRE BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN A
SURRENDER ON OUR PART."

   FMLN SPOKESMAN MIGUEL SAENZ SAID: "THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CONCRETE REPLIES TO OUR REQUESTS."

   SAENZ SAID: "SINCE THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE
GOVERNMENT DELEGATES, THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS FOR PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY."

   JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA SAID: "FIRST WE NEED THE
FMLN TO CEASE HOSTILITIES, THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THE
GUERRILLAS CAN RETURN TO THE MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY.

   SANTAMARIA REITERATED: "WE WANT PEACE, AN END TO THE WAR, AND AN
END TO THE KILLING, THE PAIN, AND THE BITTERNESS OF THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE."

   UN ENVOY ALVARO SOTO AND OAS ENVOY RICARDO GJIVOJE ARE ATTENDING
THE DIALOGUE AS OBSERVERS, AS WELL AS MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ,
AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR.

   DURING THE SECOND DAY OF TALKS, THERE WAS FRICTION BETWEEN THE FMLN
AND THE GOVERNMENT WHEN INFORMATION SECRETARY MAURICIO SANDOVAL OPENLY
ACCUSED THE FMLN OF MURDERING ANA ISABEL CASANOVA [NAME AS RECEIVED],
DAUGHTER OF COLONEL OSCAR EDGARDO CASANOVA, DIRECTOR OF THE ARMED
FORCES STUDIES CENTER.

   FMLN COMMANDER "LUISA" MERCEDES DEL CARMEN RETANA IMMEDIATELY
DENIED SANDOVAL'S CHARGE AND SAID: "THE FMLN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
THAT MURDER PERPETRATED TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR."

   THE MURDER ALSO PROMPTED ACCUSATIONS IN THE MEETING BY THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES WHO SAID: "THE FMLN IS IN THE
HABIT OF PERPETRATING THIS SORT OF ACTIONS WHEN IMPORTANT MEETINGS ARE
BEING HELD."

   THE FMLN DELEGATES SAID: "THE CHARGE AGAINST THE FMLN IS
GROUNDLESS."

   THIS AFTERNOON, MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ SEEMED VERY SKEPTICAL
ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE SAN JOSE TALKS, "BECAUSE FOR THE DIALOGUE TO
SUCCEED IT IS NECESSARY AND URGENT THAT THE TWO SIDES, THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE FMLN, YIELD A LITTLE."

   IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DIALOGUE MAY CONTINUE TOMORROW WHEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ANNOUNCED THEY WILL ISSUE SEPARATE
PRESS RELEASES.

   BOGOTA, 17 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED
THAT RADIO ANNOUNCER DIEGO VARGAS ESCOBAR WAS ASSASSINATED TODAY IN
MEDELLIN, IN NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA.  THIS IS THE SECOND SUCH CRIME TO
SHAKE MEDELLIN IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS.

   THE POLICE SAID VARGAS ESCOBAR, 56, WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TWO MEN
RIDING A MOTORCYCLE AS HE ARRIVED AT HIS HOUSE AT 1950 (0050 GMT 18
OCTOBER).

   THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THE ASSASSINS FLED AFTER COMMITTING
THE ASSASSINATION.  THEY SAID THEY DO NOT KNOW THE MOTIVE.

   DIEGO VARGAS ESCOBAR HAD WORKED AT CADENA RADIAL COLOMBIANA
(CARACOL) UNTIL 2 MONTHS AGO, AND SINCE THEN HE HAS BEEN WORKING AT
THE VOICE OF AMERICA.

   THE ANNOUNCER'S ASSASSINATION CAME ONLY 12 HOURS AFTER "THE
EXTRADITABLES," THE ARMED WING OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, GUNNED DOWN
JUDGE HECTOR JIMENEZ RODRIGUEZ IN MEDELLIN, THE COUNTRY'S SECOND MOST
IMPORTANT CITY, LOCATED 250 KM NORTHWEST OF BOGOTA.

   SAN JOSE, 18 OCT 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]
TODAY AGREED TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE DIALOGUE AND TO MEET IN OTHER
COUNTRIES EVERY MONTH DESPITE THE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.

   ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT CONVINCE THE GUERRILLAS TO LAY
DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND RETURN TO POLITICAL LIFE AND THE FMLN COULD NOT
SUCCEED IN SECURING FROM THE AUTHORITIES "TRUE GUARANTEES" FOR
DEMOCRATIZATION AND SECURITY PRIOR TO ENDING THE ARMED STRUGGLE, THE
PROTAGONISTS OF THE DIALOGUE SEEMED SATISFIED AT THE END OF THE
MEETING.

   MONSIGNOR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, SAN SALVADOR AUXILIARY BISHOP AND
MEDIATOR IN THE TALKS, TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT LAST NIGHT'S MEETING WAS
"DIFFICULT YET FRUITFUL" AFTER COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS
VISITED THE CONVENT SITE OF THE MEETING.

   ARIAS MET FOR A WHILE ON 17 OCTOBER WITH THE DELEGATION MEMBERS AND
THE MEDIATORS AT THE SAINT CLARE CONVENT, WHERE THE DIALOGUE IS TAKING
PLACE, AND SUCCEEDED IN UNBLOCKING THE MEETING, WHICH HAD BEEN BOGGED
DOWN IN THE MORNING, ACCORDING TO ROSA CHAVEZ.

   ARIAS, WHO WAS AWARDED THE 1987 NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS PEACE EFFORTS
IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID WHILE LEAVING THE MEETING WITH THE
NEGOTIATORS AND MEDIATORS ON 17 OCTOBER THAT HE WAS MOVED TO INTERVENE
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO "ENCOURAGE THE SIDES TO KEEP NEGOTIATING."

   ARIAS STRESSED THE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A RAPID SOLUTION FOR A
PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS LASTED 10 YEARS AND KILLED MORE THAN
70,000 PEOPLE. HE POINTED OUT THAT "THERE IS STILL WILLINGNESS TO SEEK
PEACEFUL WAYS TO END THIS BLOODY CONFRONTATION."

   ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, BOTH SIDES ARE WILLING TO
"GO OVER SOME IDEAS," PRESENTED IN THIS MEETING, AND KEEP ELABORATING
ON THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SALVADORAN SITUATION.

   REGARDING THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES, WHICH WAS MENTIONED AS THE
MAIN POINT EARLY IN THE MEETING BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROVED BECAUSE
OF A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SIDES, AN ACCORD WAS FINALLY REACHED TO
"CLARIFY" THE MEANING OF THE PHRASE.

   ACCORDING TO FMLN SPOKESMAN JESUS ROJAS, THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION
HAS CONTINUED TO INDICATE THAT "IT HAS NO DECISIONMAKING ABILITY" AND
THIS HAS CAUSED UNCERTAINTY IN THE NEGOTIATIONS.

   CESAR MARTI, ANOTHER FMLN MEMBER, SAID "SUBSTANTIAL ACCORDS" HAVE
NOT BEEN ANTICIPATED, BUT THE "THE DIALOGUE HAS BEEN SAVED."

   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THE MEETING, THE SECOND SINCE DIRECT CONTACTS WERE
RESUMED IN MEXICO CITY IN SEPTEMBER ENDS TODAY.

   TODAY IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED WHERE AND WHEN THE 3D MEETING WILL BE
HELD, PERHAPS IN CARACAS, ALTHOUGH THE REBELS INSIST THAT THE MEETING
SITE SHOULD BE SAN SALVADOR.

   LA PAZ, 18 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] PERU HAS GIVEN BOLIVIA FREE ZONES
IN TWO PERUVIAN PORTS TO FACILITATE THAT COUNTRY'S ACCESS TO THE SEA.
BOLIVIA LOST ITS PACIFIC COASTLINE IN A WAR AGAINST CHILE IN 1879.

   THIS AGREEMENT WAS REACHED DURING A MEETING BETWEEN PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA ON BOARD
A SHIP ANCHORED ON THE HIGHEST LAKE IN THE WORLD, LAKA TITICACA.

   "IT HAS BEEN A FRUITFUL MEETING BECAUSE WE AGREED ON SEVERAL ISSUES
THAT GO BEYOND THE RHETORIC OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS," THE PERUVIAN
CHIEF OF STATE SAID AFTER THE SESSION.

   "WE MET TO DEFINITIVELY IMPLEMENT AN OLD PERUVIAN OFFERING," GARCIA
ADDED.

   ACCORDING TO THE JOINT DECLARATION THAT WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC
AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT, THE FREE ZONES ARE LOCATED IN THE PORTS
OF MATARANI AND ILO, IN SOUTHERN PERU, IN KEEPING WITH AN OFFER MADE
BY THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IN 1979.

   THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT BOLIVIA HAS GAINED ACCESS TO FREE ZONES

   LA PAZ, 18 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] PERU HAS GIVEN BOLIVIA FREE ZONES
IN TWO PERUVIAN PORTS TO FACILITATE THAT COUNTRY'S ACCESS TO THE SEA.
BOLIVIA LOST ITS PACIFIC COASTLINE IN A WAR AGAINST CHILE IN 1879.

   THIS AGREEMENT WAS REACHED DURING A MEETING BETWEEN PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA ON BOARD
A SHIP ANCHORED ON THE HIGHEST LAKE IN THE WORLD, LAKA TITICACA.

   "IT HAS BEEN A FRUITFUL MEETING BECAUSE WE AGREED ON SEVERAL ISSUES
THAT GO BEYOND THE RHETORIC OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS," THE PERUVIAN
CHIEF OF STATE SAID AFTER THE SESSION.

   "WE MET TO DEFINITIVELY IMPLEMENT AN OLD PERUVIAN OFFERING," GARCIA
ADDED.

   ACCORDING TO THE JOINT DECLARATION THAT WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC
AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT, THE FREE ZONES ARE LOCATED IN THE PORTS
OF MATARANI AND ILO, IN SOUTHERN PERU, IN KEEPING WITH AN OFFER MADE
BY THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IN 1979.

   THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT BOLIVIA HAS GAINED ACCESS TO FREE ZONES
IN PERUVIAN PORTS. THE ONLY FREE PORT BOLIVIA PREVIOUSLY HAD ACCESS TO
WAS THE CHILEAN PORT OF IQUIQUE.

   BOGOTA, 19 OCT 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT]
SPECIAL SECURITY MEASURES WERE ADOPTED AT THE CONGRESS TODAY.  ONLY
PARLIAMENTARIANS, JOURNALISTS, AND EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE
BUILDING.  THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS BEEN BANNED.  THESE MEASURES WERE
IMPLEMENTED AFTER A PAID ASSASSIN WAS KILLED RIGHT IN BOLIVAR SQUARE
BY A GRENADE HE WAS TRYING TO THROW AT THE CONGRESS BUILDING.

   THE ABORTED ACTION BY THE TERRORIST ON 18 OCTOBER FORCED THE
AUTHORITIES TO REINFORCE SECURITY AT THE CONGRESS. HOWEVER, BOLIVAR
SQUARE WAS POORLY PATROLLED.  SEVERAL ONLOOKERS ARRIVED AT THE SQUARE
EARLY THIS MORNING TO SEE WHERE THE TERRORIST WAS KILLED WHEN THE
GRENADE EXPLODED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SECURITY OFFICER] THOSE WHO CANNOT
SHOW PROPER IDENTITY CARDS WILL NOT BE ADMITTED.

   [REPORTER] DOES THIS INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS?

   [OFFICER] YES, ANYONE WHO HAS LEGITIMATE BUSINESS HERE AT THE
CONGRESS.  [END RECORDING]

   THE MEASURES CAUSED VARIOUS REACTIONS AND ANGERED SOME CONGRESSMEN.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] WHY WAS THIS SENATOR NOT ADMITTED?

   [OFFICER] BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO BE SEARCHED, AS EVERYBODY MUST BE.

   [UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN] SEARCHING CONGRESSMEN IS NOT VERY NICE,
BUT IT WOULD BE WORSE IF ONE WERE KILLED.  [END RECORDING]

   EMPLOYEES DID NOT ESCAPE THE CHECK EITHER.  THE POLICE EVEN
CORDONED OFF THE OUTSIDE AREAS NEAR WHERE THE COMMISSIONS WORK.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 OCT 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [SPEECH]
[SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] ...WHICH IS THE
OVERALL RESULT, BUT ALSO ANALYZED THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS MEETING WAS
HELD BECAUSE WE BELIEVE, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED, THAT THE PEOPLE
MUST BE INFORMED, THE PEOPLE MUST KNOW THE TRUTH.  INITIALLY, THIS
SECOND MEETING WITH THE FMLN IS A FOLLOWUP TO THE MEXICO ACCORD IN
SEPTEMBER.

   WE WANT TO BEGIN BY BRIEFLY EXPLAINING WHAT THE MEXICO ACCORD WAS,
PARTICULARLY WHAT WE AGREED TO DISCUSS IN THE MEETING IN SAN JOSE,
COSTA RICA.  WE HAVE HERE THE TEXT OF THE MEXICO ACCORD, AND IN THE
CHAPTER CONCERNING THE NEXT MEETING IT SAYS: THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION
WILL BE THE END OF HOSTILITIES, BASED ON PROPOSALS BY THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].

   IN VIEW OF THE MEXICO ACCORD, OUR DELEGATION BEGAN TO WORK ON A
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT TO OUTLINE WHAT COULD
BE AN END TO HOSTILITIES.  WHY HAVE WE INSISTED ON THIS TOPIC?
BECAUSE WE WANT AN END TO VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY, THE END OF WEAPONS
FIRING, THE END OF BOMB EXPLOSIONS, THE END OF MINES MUTILATING THE
LITTLE HANDS AND FEET OF CHILDREN IN RURAL AREAS.  WE WANT TO SEE AN
END TO THE DESTRUCTION OF EL SALVADOR, AND AN ATMOSPHERE OF CORDIALITY
AND TRANQUILITY WITH GREATER POSSIBILITIES FOR THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.

   THAT IS THE PHILOSPHY, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, AND EACH ONE OF YOU AS PART OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, DO NOT
DESERVE THIS VIOLENT SITUATION, THIS HOSTILE SITUATION GENERATED BY
THE ARMED GROUPS OF THE FMLN.

   THE PROPOSAL IS ALSO BASED ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN,
ESQUIPULAS II, AND THE SUBSEQUENT AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE FIVE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  I WOULD LIKE TO RECALL THE TELA
AGREEMENT, THE LAST AGREEMENT.  IN PART III, THE AGREEMENT READS AS
FOLLOWS:

   THE FMLN IS STRONGLY URGED TO END HOSTILITIES IN AN IMMEDIATE AND
EFFECTIVE MANNER TO HOLD A DIALOGUE THAT WILL LEAD TO GIVING UP THE
ARMED STRUGGLE; THE FMLN MEMBERS WILL RETURN TO DEMOCRATIC LIFE.

   CLANDESTINE, 19 OCT 89 -- [TEXT] RUBEN ZAMORA, LEADER OF THE
POPULAR SOCIAL CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE, WAS
UNHARMED FOLLOWING A TERRORIST ATTACK.

   ZAMORA SAID THE COUNTRY IS SUFFERING FROM A WAVE OF VIOLENCE
LAUNCHED BY GROUPS THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS TO SUCCEED. HE
ALSO SAID THERE ARE ULTRARIGHTIST GROUPS THAT DO NOT SEEK A NEGOTIATED
SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEIR INTERESTS WILL BE HARMED, AND
ADDED THAT THERE ARE GROUPS WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES AND ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS.
HE SAID THESE GROUPS TEND TO REACT WITH INCREASED VIOLENCE.


DEV-MUC3-0589 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), 20 OCT 89 -- [SPEECH] [CRISTIANI] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] THE FMLN HAS DONE NOTHING BUT INSIST ON AN IMMEDIATE
ANSWER TO ALL OF THIS.  LOGICALLY, I CANNOT SAY THAT THEIR'S IS A
SERIOUS POSITION BECAUSE WHEN A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS ARE PUT FORWARD, A
PERIOD OF TIME IS REQUIRED TO ANALYZE THEM.  HOWEVER, THE FMLN
IMMEDIATELY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL, SAYING THAT IT WOULD
NOT ACCEPT IT.  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?  THAT THE FMLN NO LONGER WANTS TO
TALK ABOUT THE END OF THE HOSTILITIES, BUT WANTS TO INTRODUCE NEW
TOPICS AT THE SAN JOSE MEETING.

   HOWEVER, DESPITE THE FMLN'S POSITION, AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAS NOT
BEEN AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF ALL THE DOCUMENTS, ONE CAN SEE AT FIRST
GLANCE THAT THE PROPOSALS THEY HAVE PUT FORWARD ARE TOTALLY ABSURD.  I
WILL CITE AN EXAMPLE: YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE FMLN HAS ADMITTED TO
BEING UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A POSITION, THAT IF IT ATTEMPTS TO OCCUPY A
TOWN, IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS THE ARMED FORCES DRIVE IT OUT.  IT CANNOT
MAINTAIN A POSITION IN THE COUNTRY.  NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN PROPOSAL
ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH TERRITORIAL LIMITS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

   WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE FMLN EXISTS AND IS A REALITY, I BELIEVE
THAT REALITY HAS A DIMENSION, A SIZE.  THE RESULTS OF THE PAST
ELECTIONS, THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING OVER 3 PERCENT [WON BY THE
DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE], INDICATE THAT THE FMLN IS A REALITY BUT A
VERY SMALL ONE, AND THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORCE A
GOVERNMENT AND A PEOPLE TO VIOLATE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.

   MEANWHILE, THE FMLN HAS COME UP WITH THE TOTALLY ABSURD NOTION THAT
THE GOVERNMENT MUST DISMISS THE ENTIRE [MILITARY] CLASS OF '66, THE
DEFENSE MINISTER, AND THE COMMANDER OF THE AIR FORCE.  THAT IS TOTALLY
ABSURD, IT IS A RIDICULOUS POSITION THAT DOES NOT TRULY SHOW ANY
INTENTION TO MOVEMENT TOWARD PEACE.  THE FMLN PROPOSAL ALSO CALLS FOR
THE GOVERNMENT TO INSTRUCT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO CHANGE ALL OF
THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.  THESE, SALVADORAN FRIENDS, ARE TOTALLY
ABSURD POSITIONS; ALTHOUGH THESE ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT, THEIR
PREVIOUS POSITIONS ARE EVER PRESENT.

   THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT AT ANY TIME VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION, IT
WILL NEVER QUESTION THE SACRIFICES THAT YOU AND ALL THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE HAVE MADE DURING THESE LONG YEARS IN ORDER TO GRADUALLY
STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WHICH MAY NOT BE PERFECT -- AND WE
WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS DIFFERENT WAYS OF PERFECTING IT -- BUT WE WILL
NEVER SELL IT OR SACRIFICE IT, ESPECIALLY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH,
BY ALL MEANS, ARE ABSURD.

   WHAT IS WORSE, HOWEVER, IS THAT ALONG WITH THE ATTITUDE THE FMLN
HAS DISPLAYED IN COSTA RICA, ALONG WITH ITS REJECTION OF EVERYTHING
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, ITS ATTEMPTS TO MODIFY THE AGENDA WE HAD AGREED
UPON IN MEXICO, ITS EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE A SERIES OF DOCUMENTS, AND
ITS DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE ANSWERS, IT HAS INITIATED A STRATEGY OF
MURDERS HERE IN EL SALVADOR.  EVERYONE HAS NOTICED; THEY MURDERED A
REPORTER'S WIFE AND SON.  WHY?  BECAUSE THEY HAD A RELATIVE IN THE
ARMED FORCES.  THEY HAVE MURDERED AN INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL, AT A SAFE
DISTANCE, IN A COWARDLY MANNER, ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS A RELATIVE OF
 AN ARMED FORCES MEMBER.  YESTERDAY THEY ATTEMPTED TO MURDER A FORMER
MILITARY MAN WHO ALSO HAS A RELATIVE IN THE ARMED FORCES.

   WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN?  THAT THE FMLN INTENDS TO TALK OVER
THERE [COSTA RICA] AND TO MAKE AN ENTIRE CASE OUT OF ITS DEFENDING
HUMAN RIGHTS, WHILE MURDERING PEOPLE AND VIOLATING THE HUMAN RIGHTS
THEY CLAIM TO BE DEFENDING, ON A DAILY BASIS.  ALL OF THESE FMLN
ATTITUDES FORCE US TO DIALOGUE, AND AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING, I MUST
BE COMPLETELY CLEAR AND OPEN.  I MUST TELL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THE
TRUTH.

   I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR THE FMLN HAS NOT DISPLAYED THE POLITICAL
RESOLVE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  FIRST OF ALL, THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT TO
TALK ABOUT ENDING THE CONFLICT, IT DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY -- YOU AND I, MY DEAR VIEWERS -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP
LIVING IN THIS WHIRLPOOL OF VIOLENCE, TO LIVE IN PEACE, AND TO ALLOW
THE PROCESS TO PROGRESS IN THE SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS THAT WILL
GRADUALLY GIVE US FIRM AND LASTING PEACE, WITHIN AN ATMOSPHERE OF
TRANQUILITY.

   THE FMLN'S ATTITUDE IS ONE OF PROVOCATION.  IT WANTS TO PROVOKE THE
GOVERNMENT INTO GETTING UP FROM THE DIALOGUE TABLE; IT HAS TRIED TO
ANGER THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION BY INSULTING THEM.  ALL IN ALL,
THE FMLN IS TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO DESIST.  WHY ARE THEY
SEEKING THIS?  BECAUSE ALL THEY WANT IS A LITTLE MORE IMAGE, THE IMAGE
THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETELY LOST BECAUSE THEIR SPACES HAVE BEEN CLOSED.
NO ONE IN THE WORLD WILL CONTINUE TO JUSTIFY AN ARMED STRUGGLE.  THAT
IS A THING OF THE PAST.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0590 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), 20 OCT 89 -- [SPEECH] [CRISTIANI] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] PRESIDENT ARIAS WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT PERHAPS FIDEL
CASTRO IS THE ONLY ONE WHO INSISTS ON THE SITUATION -- AND WHO SEEMS
TO HAVE NOT YET RETURNED FROM THE SIERRA MAESTRA WHERE HE WAS IN 1959.
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ATTITUDE OF THE FMLN LEADERS.  WHAT ELSE DO THE
ARMED FORCES, I MEAN [CORRECTS HIMSELF], DOES THE FMLN WANT WITH ALL
THESE ABSURD PROPOSALS AND ATTITUDES?  IT IS SEEKING TO DIVIDE THE
ARMED FORCES.  IT IS SEEKING TO ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
REPUBLIC.  IT WANTS TO [DISCREDIT] THE GOVERNMENT IMAGE, WHICH HAS
BEEN CONSOLIDATED LITTLE BY LITTLE AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, BECAUSE
WE ARE SHOWING TO THE WORLD THAT THERE IS A DEMOCRACY HERE, THAT A
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS BEING CONSOLIDATED, AND THAT THE FORCES THAT
ALREADY EXIST WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM ARE FORCES THAT TRULY WANT
AND SEEK PEACE, RATHER THAN FORCES THAT ASSASSINATE AND CAUSE
DESTRUCTION.  THEREFORE, WE CAN NO LONGER THINK AT THIS MOMENT, THAT
THE FMLN HAS ONLY VIEWED THE DIALOGUE FROM A STRATEGIC POINT OF VIEW.

   HOWEVER, WE WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.  ALL THIS STRATEGY SHOULD NOT
CONFUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE MUST BE CALM BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT
OF THE REPUBLIC WILL NOT GIVE AN INCH AND WILL CONTINUE, THROUGH
RATIONAL MEANS, TO STRUGGLE AND SEARCH FOR PEACE, TO WHICH YOU AND ALL
SALVADORANS ARE ENTITLED.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO FALL INTO THE TRAPS THE
FMLN IS TRYING TO PUT BEFORE US.  HOWEVER, AT THIS MOMENT, WHAT WE
SHOULD SEE IS WHO WANTS PEACE AND WHO DOES NOT WANT TO SEARCH FOR
PEACE.  UP TO THIS MOMENT, THE FMLN HAS GIVEN NO EVIDENCE IT WANTS TO
ATTAIN PEACE AND TRANQUILITY FOR YOU, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   NEVERTHELESS, WE MUST NOT BE PESSIMISTIC.  ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT
ONE CANNOT SAY, FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES, THAT OUTSTANDING RESULTS WERE
OBTAINED AT THE MEETING IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, SOME RESULTS WERE
ATTAINED.  THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE AND THAT SHOULD
ELIMINATE ALL TRACES OF PESSIMISM.  WE MUST THINK THAT THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN MEXICO WAS NOT BROKEN IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA,
AND THAT THIS PROCESS WILL CONTINUE NEXT MONTH IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.
THE ISSUE AGAIN WILL BE CEASING HOSTILITIES.  WE ARE BECOMING MORE AND
MORE AWARE OF THE VARIOUS POSITIONS, AND THERE IS LESS ROOM TO PLAY
STRATEGIC GAMES WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY SUBJECT IN THIS
DIALOGUE PROCESS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST DO THIS IN AN ORDERLY MANNER.
WHEN WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, SUCH AGREEMENTS MUST BE RESPECTED.  THAT
IS THE ATTITUDE THAT SHOULD PREVAIL IF THERE IS A TRUE POLITICAL
DESIRE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  THEREFORE, ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO CONCLUDE MY
MESSAGE BY MAKING AN APPEAL FOR UNITY.  WE MUST BE UNITED FOR PEACE.
ALL SECTORS -- POLITICAL, LABOR, RELIGIOUS, AND BUSINESS -- MUST
DEMAND THAT THE FMLN SHOW A TRUE DESIRE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  WE MUST
DEMAND THAT THE FMLN STOP TRYING TO USE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR FOR
STRATEGIC PURPOSES.  IF THE FMLN TRULY WANTS PEACE, WHY DOES IT
CONTINUE TO SMUGGLE WEAPONS -- PROBABLY
 FROM NICARAGUA -- INTO EL SALVADOR.  TODAY, A TRUCK FROM NICARAGUA
LOADED WITH WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES FOR THE FMLN WAS CONFISCATED AT THE
BORDER WITH HONDURAS.  THIS SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS NOT YET SERIOUSLY
SEARCHING FOR PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, THE UNITY OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD FORCE THE FMLN TO SEARCH FOR PEACE.  THE
UNITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD CLOSE POLITICAL SPACE SO THE
[FMLN] WILL STOP ITS STRATEGIC GAMES.  ALL OF US, UNITED, SHOULD
DEMAND THAT THE FMLN TAKE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS SERIOUSLY, EQUALLY AS
SERIOUSLY AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  WE FIRMLY BELIEVE WE MUST
SEARCH THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS TO HAVE PEACE AND CALM IN EL SALVADOR.

   SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US NOT DISMAY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE EXCESSIVE ENTHUSIASM.  THIS IS NOT AN EASY PROBLEM,
THERE WILL BE OBSTACLES, IT IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE
ALWAYS SAID YOU CAN BE SURE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT IS WORKING FOR PEACE
AND WILL NOT CEASE TO WORK FOR PEACE.

   MAY GOD BLESS YOU.  GOOD EVENING.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 OCT 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS, SALVADORAN DEFENSE AND PUBLIC
SECURITY MINISTER, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT] [LARIOS] THIS HAS
REALLY BEEN AN AGREEMENT THAT REFLECTS THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERESTS, AS
WELL AS THE INTERESTS OF THE TERRORIST FRONT.  IN THIS RESPECT, WE
AGREE WITH THE TEXT OF THE SAN JOSE ACCORD.

   [REPORTER] AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD YESTERDAY AT THE UND, THE
NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION, IT WAS SAID THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF
TWO U.S. ADVISERS AND ONE U.S. MILITARY ADVISER PREVENTED GREATER
PROGRESS IN THE DIALOGUE.  HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

   [LARIOS] WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT TERRORISTS TRY TO CONFUSE AND
TRY TO FOSTER AN ATTITUDE AND ACTIONS IN THE PEOPLE SOLELY TO JUSTIFY
THEMSELVES.  AT NO TIME WAS THE MILITARY DELEGATION, WHICH
PARTICIPATED AS ADVISERS IN THE DIALOGUE, ABLE TO INFLUENCE THE
DECISIONS OF THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION.  THEIR ROLE AS ADVISERS ENABLED
THEM TO GIVE ADVICE TO THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION, BUT IT IS ABSURD TO
THINK THAT THE PRESENCE OF OUR TWO MILITARY ADVISERS AND OTHER
ADVISERS PREVENTED REAL AND COMPLEX POSITIONS FROM BEING TAKEN AT THAT
MEETING.

   [REPORTER] THERE IS NO U.S. ADVISER...

   [LARIOS, INTERRUPTING] MOREOVER, WE CANNOT.... [CHANGES THOUGHT] NO
U.S. ADVISER ACCOMPANIED OUR DELEGATION.  IF THERE WAS ONE, HE WENT
STRICTLY ON HIS OWN.  YOUR QUESTION, THEREFORE, IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE
IT ALLOWS US TO TELL YOU THAT THE SALVADORAN MILITARY DELEGATION NEVER
HAMPERED THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION DURING THE TALKS.

   [REPORTER] THE NONGOVERNMENT HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION PRESENTED THE
RELATIVES OF TORTURED AND CAPTURED PERSONS.  IT ACCUSED 1ST INFANTRY
BRIGADE COMMANDER FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES AND OTHER OFFICERS OF HAVING
TIES TO THE DEATH SQUADS.

   [LARIOS] I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THESE KINDS OF REPORTS OVER THE
PAST FEW DAYS.  FRIENDS -- AND HERE I AM APPEALING TO MY FRIENDS --
LET US NOT ALLOW THE TERRORISTS' DESPERATE ACTIONS TO CONFUSE AND
CONVEY A FALSE MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE.  THE FACT IS THAT THIS IS PART
OF THE STRATEGY OF DECEIT, LIES, AND DISRESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE
COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE TERRORISTS.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [LARIOS] LET ME REPEAT THAT THIS IS PART OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED
STRATEGY.  WE MUST NOT BE DECEIVED.  WE KNOW FULL WELL WHO THE PERSONS
ARE WHO ARE TRYING TO SOW MISTRUST AND CONFUSION AMONG CIVILIANS.  WE
ARE A RESPONSIBLE, SERIOUS, AND FORMAL INSTITUTION.  IT IS UP TO US TO
INVESTIGATE ALL THESE VIOLENT INCIDENTS AND DEATHS.  WE WILL DO OUR
DUTY BY CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION. [CONTINUED]

BARRANQUILLA.  BARRANQUILLA RESIDENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED TONIGHT
FOLLOWING THIS AFTERNOON'S CAR BOMB EXPLOSION, WHICH WOUNDED AT LEAST
10 PERSONS AND CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE.  THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED WHEN A
CAR FILLED WITH TOURISTS WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE ROYAL HOTEL.
FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO FATALITIES.  OFFICIALS CAPTURED ONE OF THE
TERRORISTS; HIS NAME IS JOSE RAMIREZ, AGED 24, AND HE IS FROM ARMENIA.

CAPTURED TODAY WERE TWO [AS HEARD] EXTRADITABLES AND ONE BOMB PLANTER,
WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE HERE ARE CALLING THESE TERRORISTS.

   THE TERRORIST, WHO GIVES HIS NAME AS GONZALO PINZON LAGOS, 24, WAS
CAPTURED BY DIJIN [DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS].
HE CONFESSED TO PARTICIPATING IN BOMB ATTACKS EARLY THIS MONTH AGAINST
THE ENERGY TOWERS LOCATED AT ROJAS AVENUE AND 75TH STREET AND IN
CAFAN SARSAMORA.  A TERRORIST WORKING FOR THE JOHN BOLANOS LOPEZ
GANG WAS KILLED IN THIS ATTACK.  RICARDO BOLANOS RODRIGUEZ, THE GANG
LEADER'S FATHER, WAS ALSO ARRESTED.  HE IS ACCUSED OF RECRUITING
TERRORISTS.  THIS MORNING, HE WAS GOING TO PUT A BOMB AT THE AZULEJOS
CORONA STORE, ALONG THE MEDELLIN SPEEDWAY.

   AN EXTRADITABLE WAS CAPTURED BY THE POLICE WHILE HE WAS IN THE
CERREJON INSTALLATIONS, IN THE TOWN OF MAICAO, GUAJIRA INTENDANCY.  HE
COMES FROM BARRANQUILLA AND IS IDENTIFIED AS ROBERT JAMIS
SOCOLOGUISQUI SALA.  THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA IS REQUESTING HIS
EXTRADITION, BUT MEANWHILE HE WILL REMAIN AT DIJIN INSTALLATIONS.


DEV-MUC3-0594 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   LONDON (UK), 19 OCT 89 (BEIJING XINHUA) -- [TEXT] BRITAIN AND
ARGENTINA TODAY AGREED TO RESUME THEIR CONSULAR RELATIONS AND DIRECT
AIR AND SEA LINKS SEVERED DURING THEIR WAR OVER SOVEREIGNTY OF THE
MALVINAS (FALKLANDS) ISLANDS SEVEN YEARS AGO.

   AFTER THREE DAYS OF SUBSTANTIVE TALKS IN MADRID, THE TWO COUNTRIES
AGREED "TO LIFT ALL REMAINING RESTRICTIONS" ON TRADE AND FINANCIAL
EXCHANGES, SAID A JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED HERE TODAY.

   THEY ALSO EXPRESSED A WISH TO NORMALIZE THEIR TIES "WITH A VIEW TO
RESUMING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS," IT SAID.

   THE DISCUSSIONS WERE HELD BETWEEN BRITISH NEGOTIATOR CRISPIN
TICKELL, BRITAIN'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, AND VETERAN
ARGENTINE DIPLOMAT LUCIO GARCIA DE SOLAR.

   THE TALKS, ARRANGED AFTER THE TWO SPECIAL ENVOYS MET IN NEW YORK IN
AUGUST, WERE EXTENDED A DAY BEYOND ITS TWO-DAY SCHEDULE.

   THEY AGREED TO HOLD FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS TO STRIVE FOR THE
RESUMPTION OF THE TWO COUNTRIES' DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BROKEN DURING
THE 1982 MALVINAS WAR. THE NEXT SUBSTANTIVE MEETING WILL BE HELD ON
FEBRUARY 14-15, 1990.

   DURING THE MADRID TALKS, THE TWO COUNTRIES PUT ASIDE THE
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE SOUTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS,
WHICH BLOCKED THEIR FIRST RECONCILIATION ATTEMPT IN BERN, SWITZERLAND,
IN 1984.

   THE COMMUNIQUE SAID THAT THE TALKS ALLOWED BOTH SIDES TO HOLD THEIR
RESPECTIVE POSITIONS ON THE ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE ISLANDS AND
THAT NOTHING OF THEIR AGREEMENT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A CHANGE IN
THEIR POSITIONS.

   AS REGARDS FISHERIES, THE COMMUNIQUE SAID, BOTH DELEGATIONS HAD
DIFFERENT POSITIONS BUT AGREED "TO SET UP A WORKING GROUP WITH A VIEW
TO MAKING PROPOSALS" TO BE SUBMITTED TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS.

   ARGENTINA HOPES FOR THE LIFTING OF THE 150-MILE (240-KILOMETER)
EXCLUSIVE ZONE AROUND THE MALVINAS ISLANDS IMPOSED BY BRITAIN AFTER
THE 10-WEEK WAR, WHICH KILLED MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE.

   A BRITISH TRADE MISSION WILL VISIT ARGENTINA FROM NOVEMBER 27 TO
DECEMBER 1, THIS YEAR, AND A NEW CULTURAL AGREEMENT COULD BE EXPECTED
AS NORMALIZATION ADVANCED FURTHER, ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT.

   LINKS AND CONTACTS BETWEEN THE FALKLANDS AND THE CONTINENTAL
MAINLAND WOULD BE DEVELOPED AS BENEFICIAL.

   BRITAIN ALSO AGREED TO HELP ARGENTINA ESTABLISH ITS COOPERATIVE
LINKS WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS REJECTED COMMERCIAL TIES
WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY BECAUSE OF ITS UNNORMALIZED RELATIONS
WITH BRITAIN. BRITAIN IS ONE OF THE 12 MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITY.

   DESCRIBING THE AGREEMENT AS REMARKABLE, TICKELL, THE BRITISH CHIEF
NEGOTIATOR, SAID: "WE HAVE TAKEN A VERY LARGE STEP TOWARDS DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS ... WE ARE NOT THERE YET."

   ARGENTINE NEGOTIATOR DEL SOLAR EXPRESSED OPTIMISM FOR THE
RESUMPTION OF FULL DIPLOMATIC TIES AND SAID: "MY IMPRESSION IS THAT
THIS WILL NOT BE TOO LONG."

   THE ANGLO-ARGENTINE RAPPROCHEMENT WAS INITIATED BY ARGENTINA'S
PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM, WHO TOOK OFFICE IN JULY. MENEM SAID ON THE
SECOND DAY AFTER HIS INAUGURATION THAT TALKS COULD BE RESUMED ON
RESTORATION OF THE TWO COUNTRIES' DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITHOUT
DISCUSSING SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE MALVINAS ISLANDS.

   HE VOICED THE HOPE THAT THE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS COULD RESUME BY
CHRISTMAS, A TIMETABLE THAT BRITAIN SAID IS EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS.

   HOWEVER, OBSERVERS HERE SAID THE MADRID AGREEMENT HAS PAVED THE WAY
FOR BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA TO TALK TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT TOUCHING THE
THORNY ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE ISLANDS.

   BY REACHING THE AGREEMENT, BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA HAVE TAKEN A
STRIDE TOWARD RECONCILIATION, THEY SAID.

RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF,
TODAY SAID THAT THE WEAPONS CONFISCATED BY HONDURAN TROOPS WERE SENT
FROM NICARAGUA AND INTENDED FOR THE URBAN PONCE REFERRED TO THE RECENT
SEIZURE OF WEAPONS FROM A VAN WITH A SALVADORAN LICENSE PLATE WHICH
WERE SENT BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT VIA COSTA RICA TO THE FMLN.  HE
SAID THAT THE ARSENAL INCLUDED A LARGE QUANTITY OF EXPLOSIVES AND HIGH
CALIBER WEAPONS THAT WERE HIDDEN IN SECRET COMPARTMENTS OF THE VAN,
WHICH WAS CARRYING FURNITURE FOR A SALVADORAN FAMILY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] THIS DEMONSTRATES ONCE MORE THAT THE
NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES SUPPORTING THE FMLN STRUGGLE AND IS
DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE URBAN COMMANDOS, WHICH ARE THE FMLN DEATH
SQUADS IN THIS CITY.  THESE MANUALS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN NICARAGUA
AND BEAR THE FMLN LETTERHEAD.  THEY ARE INTENDED FOR THE URBAN
COMMANDOS AND INCLUDE TACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS AS WELL AS DIRECTIONS ON
HOW TO USE ARMS.  [END RECORDING]

   IN ADDITION, COL PONCE SHOWED A DOCUMENT THAT WAS SEIZED AT EL
TIGRE HILL, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, ON 30 JULY, DEALING WITH MILITARY
THEORY AND URBAN WAR WHICH, HE SAID, THE FMLN IS CARRYING OUT IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] THE DOCUMENT SAYS THE FOLLOWING IN ONE OF
ITS PARAGRAPHS: THE WAR AGAINST THE AUTHORITIES MUST BE TOTAL AND MUST
REACH THEIR PROPERTIES, FAMILIES, HOMES, WORK PLACES, AND VACATION
RETREATS. WE MUST ALWAYS GIVE PRIORITY TO EXECUTIONS, BUT HARASSMENT,
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE, ETC, ARE ALSO PART OF THIS POLICY AND MAY BE
CARRIED OUT BY THE LESS EXPERIENCED ECHELONS TO DEVELOP EXPERIENCE IN
USING WEAPONS.  THIS SHOWS THAT THE CLAIM THAT WAS MADE BY THE
TERRORIST RINGLEADERS IN COSTA RICA IS NOT VALID.  IT IS NOT TRUE THAT
THEY DISAGREE WITH THIS LINE.  [END RECORDING]

   ACCORDING TO PONCE'S STATEMENTS, THE ACTIONS UNCOVERED BY MILITARY
INTELLIGENCE ARE TOTALLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE TOPICS DISCUSSED AT THE
NEGOTIATING TABLES IN MEXICO AND COSTA RICA, BECAUSE THEY TALK ABOUT
REACHING PEACE BUT THEIR ACTIONS SHOW THE CONTRARY.

   BUENOS AIRES, 19 OCT 89 (NA) -- [TEXT] AFTER MEETING WITH PRESIDENT
MENEM, FORMER MONTONEROS CHIEFS FERNANDO VACA NARVAJA AND ROBERTO
CIRILO PERDIA HAVE STATED THAT THEY WILL BECOME "LEADERS" OF THE
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION MOVEMENT AND ENTIRELY SUPPORT THE JUSTICIALIST
GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC PROGRAM.

   THE MEMBERS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FACTION OF THE PERONIST MOVEMENT
HAVE ASKED PRESIDENT MENEM TO PARDON MONTONEROS LEADER MARIO
FIRMENICH, WHO IS CURRENTLY BEING HELD AT THE CASEROS PRISON.  VACA
NARVAJA AND PERDIA ALSO ANNOUNCEDS THE THEY WILL ASK FOR A MEETING
WITH ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL ISIDRO CACERES, PJ [JUSTICIALIST
PARTY] LEADER ANTONIO CAFIERO, AND TOP LEADERS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
WITH THE GOAL OF "ACHIEVING NATIONAL RECONCILIATION."

   VACA NARVAJA AND PERDIA WENT TO GOVERNMENT HOUSE TODAY AT NOON TO
THANK PRESIDENT MENEM FOR THEIR PARDON AND TO EXPRESS "OUR COMMITMENT
TO DO WHATEVER POSSIBLE TO STRENGTHEN THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION
AND NATIONAL UNITY."  THIS REMARK WAS MADE BY VACA NARVAJA TO SOME 50
JOURNALISTS GATHERED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRESS ROOM.  HE TOLD THE
JOURNALISTS THAT PRESIDENT MENEM RECEIVED THEM AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY
WILL ENJOY ALL THE RIGHTS GRANTED TO ARGENTINES.  HE ALSO ASKED THEM
TO JOIN THE PRODUCTIVE REVOLUTION.  INTERIOR MINISTER EDUARDO BAUZA
WAS ALSO PRESENT AT THE 40-MINUTE MEETING.

   DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE, THE RECENTLY PARDONED MONTONEROS
LEADERS POINTED OUT THAT THEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO PARDON MARIO
FIRMENICH.  THEY IMPLICITY ADMITTED THAT THE MILITARY MEN WHO LED THE
PROCESS OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION COULD BE RELEASED.

   VACA NARVAJA SAID IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION THAT THE MONTONEROS
"HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT AT THE LUJAN BASILICA NATIONAL SANCTUARY," AND
THAT "IT IS NOT POSSIBLE -- NOR IT IS CORRECT OR JUST -- TO CARRY OUT
ARMED OR CLANDESTINE ACTIONS WHEN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS ARE FULLY
EFFECTIVE."

   ASKED ABOUT THE MONEY COLLECTED IN THE KIDNAPPING OF IMPRESARIO
JORGE BORN, ROBERTO PERDIA SAID THAT "THIS MATTER WAS NOT DISCUSSED"
WITH PRESIDENT MENEM.  "WE MAINTAIN OUR DECISION THAT THE FUNDS WILL
BECOME AVAILABLE SO THAT THEY CAN BE USED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS
TROUBLING OUR PEOPLE," PERDIA ADDED.

   PERDIA ALSO NOTED THAT "MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN OBVIOUS SIGNS
OF UNDERSTANDING THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE AND OF WORKING FOR THE FINAL
PACIFICATION."

   ASKED IF THE MONEY OBTAINED FROM THE KIDNAPPING OF BORN WOULD BE
RETURNED, PERDIA RESPONDED THAT "IT WILL BE RETURNED TO PEOPLE WHO CAN
BEST USE IT; WE BELIEVE THAT NO ONE CAN REFUSE OR BLOCK THIS MONEY
FROM BEING RETURNED TO ITS LEGITIMATE OWNERS, THE PEOPLE, WHO BUILT
THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH WITH THEIR LABOR."

   REGARDING THE SUBJECT OF MISSING PERSONS AND IN RESPONSE TO A
QUESTION ON WHETHER THIS "WAS A CLOSED CASE," PERDIA EMPHASIZED THAT
"IT IS NECESSARY TO THINK IN THE FUTURE ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO
ARE ALIVE AND TO BUILD THE COUNTRY WITHOUT FORGETTING THE PAST."
PERDIA ALSO SADI THAT "PAST EVENTS MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE PEOPLE'S
CONSCIENCE, IN THE PEOPLE'S MEMORY, SO THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL
LEARN OUR GOOD AND EVIL EXPERIENCES."

   WHEN A CAMERAMEN FROM A FOREIGN TELEVISION STATION ASKED HIM WHEN
THE MONTONEROS WOULD RETURN THEIR WEAPONS, PERDIA SAID THAT "WE HAVE
NOT USED WEAPONS SINCE 1983" BECAUSE "WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THERE
IS NO ROOM FOR WEAPONS WHENEVER THERE ARE DEMOCRATIC WAYS."

   BUT THE CAMERAMEN LOUDLY INSISTED: WHERE ARE THE WEAPONS?  PERDIA
RESPONDED: "THERE ARE NO WEAPONS.  THEY WERE USED IN COMBAT WHEN THERE
WAS A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THEM IN A
DEMOCRACY."

   VACA NARVAJA POINTED OUT THAT THE GUARANTEE OF NOT TAKING UP ARMS
"LIES IN THE PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCE, BECAUSE ARGENTINA HAS SAID 'NEVER
AGAIN' TO MILITARY COUPS AND GUERRILLA WARFARE."

   "THE SECOND GUARANTEE IS THAT THE POLITICAL STEPS THAT WE TAKE
BEFORE THE PEOPLE MUST BE CREDIBLE ENOUGH; THEREFORE, SOME TIME MUST
PASS FOR OUR ACTIONS TO BE CONFIRMED," VACA NARVAJA ADDED.

   CONCLUDING, THE TWO MONTONEROS LEADERS PERFORMED A SELF- CRITICISM
OF THE MONTONEROS ORGANIZATION, STATING THAT IT WENT UNDERGROUD "IN AN
UNTIMELY FASHION, BECAUSE THERE WERE STILL SOVEREIGN WAYS LEFT FOR THE
PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES."
