LIBERTO GUTIERREZ MARQUEZ, THE ALLEGED FRONT MAN OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL AND
BROTHER OF A FORMER COLOMBIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL, WAS FOUND MURDERED TODAY
APPROXIMATELY 500 KM NORTHWEST OF BOGOTA.  

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT LIBERTO GUTIERREZ HAD RECENTLY DISAPPEARED AND
APPARENTLY HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY MAOIST PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY (EPL)
GUERRILLAS, BUT THIS WAS NOT CONFIRMED.

   GUTIERREZ' CORPSE WAS FOUND TODAY IN AYAPEL MUNICIPALITY, CORDOBA

LEADER.

   GUTIERREZ' FARM, LOCATED IN PUERTO TRIUNFO, A ZONE IN MAGDALENA MEDIO,

SOME STATEMENTS MADE EXCLUSIVELY TO MADRID RADIO BY A FORMER MEMBER OF
THE CHILEAN SECRET POLICE.  JOSE MANUEL MARTIN MEDEM REPORTS:

   [MARTIN MEDEM] THE EXILES FROM CHILE, ARGENTINA, AND URUGUAY REPEATEDLY
STATED THAT WHILE THERE WERE MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS IN THEIR COUNTRIES, THE
ARMED FORCES OF THE SOUTHERN HALF OF LATIN AMERICA ACTED JOINTLLY, WITHOUT
RESPECTING BORDERS, IN REPRESSION.  IN THIS WAY, THEY WERE ABLE TO KIDNAP AN
EXILE FROM WHERE HE HAD TAKEN REFUGE AND MAKE HIM RETURN TO THE COUNTRY OF
ORIGIN, WHERE MANY WERE TORTURED AND MURDERED.  OUR COLLEAGUE, JAVIER
GONZALEZ, HAS NOW MANAGED A WITNESS REPORT THAT CONFIRMS THESE ACCUSATIONS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GONZALEZ] A FORMER MEMBER OF DINA [NATIONAL
INTELLEGENCE DIRECTORATE], THE CHILEAN SECRET SERVICE UNDER PINOCHET,
HAS ASKED REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN SPAIN.  HE IS JUAN JOSE SOTO
VARGAS, WHO WORKED IN THE DINA CITIZENS' INTELLIGENCE BRIGADE.  HE HAS
TURNED AWAY FROM THE REGIME, ALTHOUGH HE MAINTAINED HIS IDEOLOGICAL
STANCE.  SOTO VARGAS, A DOCTOR BY PROFESSION AND A PASTOR OF AN
EVANGELICAL CHURCH, HAS MADE EXCLUSIVE STATEMENTS TO MADRID RADIO IN
WHICH HE CONFIRMS POLICE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE REGION'S MILITARY
GOVERNMENTS DURING THE PERIOD OF STATE TERRORISM.

   [SOTO VARGAS] WE, IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY, WORKED WITH THE ARGENTINE
FEDERAL POLICE AND WITH THE ARGENTINE ARMED FORCES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST
SUBVERSION IN 1976 AND SHORTLY BEFORE ISABEL MARTINEZ DE PERON LEFT POWER.
WE ALSO WORKED JOINTLY WITH THE SECURITY FORCES OF URAGUAY, PARAGUAY, AND
BRAZIL.  I WORKED IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY IN BRAZIL WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE
NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE OF THE BRAZILIAN CENTRAL AGENCY.  WELL,
RELATIONS WERE THE BEST AND THIS WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SOUTH AMERICAN ARMED
FORCES, AT TO INSTALL ITSELF IN SOUTH AMERICA OR TO IMPOSE ITSELF THROUGH
GUERRILLA TACTICS AND VIOLENCE.

   [GONZALEZ] SOTO VARGAS HAS ALREADY REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHICH HE HAS HAD TO LEAVE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.  HE
SAYS THAT HE DID NOT TORTURE OR KILL ANYONE AND THAT THINGS LIKE THIS DID
NOT HAPPEN IN CHILE.  HOWEVER, HE ADMITS THAT GENERAL CARLOS PRATS, THE HEAD
OF THE ARMY UNDER PRESIDENT ALLENDE, WAS ASSASSINATED IN BUENOS AIRES UNDER
ORDERS OF THE PINOCHET GOVERNMENT.

   [SOTO VARGAS] THERE IS PROOF, EVEN JUDICIAL PROOF, THAT THERE WAS
PARTICIPATION BY HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF THE CHILEAN ARMY WHO WERE ORDERED
TO CARRY OUT ASSASSINATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I WORKED IN THE MILITARY
SECTION OF THE CHILEAN EMBASSY IN ARGENTINA, GEN VICTOR HUGO BARRIERA
BARRIERA OF THE ARMY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AN THERE WAS TALK IN THE CHILEAN
EMBASSY THAT THE CHILEAN HIGH-RANKING OFFICER HAD ORDERED THE PHYSICAL

THE SUPPORT OF THE BRAZILIAN ARMY AND THE SOUTHERN UNIFIED COMMAND
(EAST OF COLOMBIA, YESTERDAY BEGAN AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS OF THE MEDELLIN AND CALI CARTELS.  ROMEU TUMA, DIRECTOR
GENERAL OF THE FEDERAL POLICE DEPARTMENT, PLANNED THE POLICE ACTION IN
A MEETING WITH GENERAL AUGUSTO RODRIGUES ARANGO OF THE SOUTHERN
UNIFIED COMMAND AND COLONEL LUIS FERNANDO GUZMAN VASQUEZ OF ARMY
HEADQUARTERS IN LETICIA, COLOMBIA.

   TUMA SAID THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS LEFT MEDELLIN AND CALI IN SMALL
AIRPLANES, PROBABLY WITH FALSE DOCUMENTS, TO GO TO MANAUS, WHERE THEY WOULD
PREPARE TO LEAVE FOR EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES.  ALL THE HOTELS OF MANAUS
ARE UNDER STRICT SURVEILLANCE.

   THE FIRST ATTEMPTS BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO ENTER BRAZIL WERE
DISCOVERED WHEN THE POLICE FOUND THREE IMPORTED CARS.  THE CARS, WHICH ARE
LUXURY MODELS MADE IN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN, ARE INCLUDED IN A LIST OF
26 CARS SENT TO THE FEDERAL POLICE BY THE COLOMBIAN JUSTICE MINISTRY.  THE
CARS WERE LEFT BY AN UNIDENTIFIED COLOMBIAN AT A CAR WASH IN TABATINGA.  AS
THE CARS WERE NOT PICKED UP BY THEIR OWNERS FOR SEVERAL DAYS, THE OWNER OF
THE CAR WASH REMOVED THE CARS'S TIRES AND CALLED THE FEDERAL POLICE, WHO
TOOK THE CARS TO POLICE FACILITIES YESTERDAY.

   TUMA BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE PLANNING TO STAY IN BRAZIL
AFTER THE MURDER OF SEVERAL COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS, BUT IN THE FACE OF THE
OFFENSIVE MOUNTED BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, THEY DECIDED TO MOVE ON.

   TUMA ALREADY HAS THE WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF 12 MEMBERS OF THE MEDELLIN

DIRECTOR FATHER GIUSSEPPE CORO PROTESTED TODAY THE MURDER OF A YOUNG
MECHANICS STUDENT AND LATER ATTEMPTS TO INVOLVE THE INSTITUTE IN
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IN THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS AT WAR.  THE RICALDONE
INSITUTE IS ONE OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT SCHOOLS RUN BY SALESIAN PRIESTS
IN EL SALVADOR.

   FATHER CORO STATED DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT STUDENT MIGUEL
ERNESTO MIRANDA REINA, 18, "WHO WAS THE BEST MECHANICS STUDENT IN THE
INSTITUTE,' WAS DESPICABLY AND COWARDLY SHOT IN THE BACK WHEN HE WAS
ABOUT TO APPROACH HIS HOUSE IN WESTERN SAN SALVADOR ON 22 AUGUST.
FATHER CORO ACCUSED THE "ATLACATL" BATTALION SOLDIERS, PARTICULARLY AN
OFFICER, "A LIEUTENANT, SERGEANT, OR WHOMEVER," WHO LATER ATTEMPTED TO
DISTORT THE EVENT BY STATING THAT THE YOUNG STUDENT WAS A "REBEL"
BECAUSE HE WORE REBEL BOOTS AND HAD A REBEL BOOK.

   THE SALESIAN PRIEST, WHO HAS LIVED IN THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY
FOR THE PAST 16 YEARS, SAID THAT THE STUDENT WAS RETURNING HOME AFTER
WORKING ON HIS THESIS AS HE WAS TO GRADUATE THIS YEAR.  THE STUDENT
WORE THE SCHOOL'S UNIFORM, HAD HIS IDENTIFICATION PAPERS, AND CARRIED
A BOOK ON RELIGION THAT SHOWED JESUS CHRIST WITH A BEARD ON ITS COVER.

   FATHER CORO STATED THAT SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO KILL AN INNOCENT
YOUNG MAN WHO WAS AN HONOR STUDENT, THE SOLDIERS HAD STARTED TO KEEP A
WATCH ON THE INSTITUTE, TO STOP STUDENTS TO HARRASS THEM MENTALLY BY
ASKING THEM IF THEY KNEW MIRANDA REINA, TO PLACE A CHECKPOINT IN FRONT
OF THE MURDERED STUDENT'S HOME, AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES.  HE ADDED
THAT IF THESE MEASURES ARE NOT STOPPED, THE SALESIAN COMMUNITY IN EL
SALVADOR WILL PROTEST TO THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND.

   FATHER CORO STATED THAT THE SALESIAN COMMUNITY FEELS AFFECTED BY
THESE ACTIONS AS THEIR SCHOOLS HAVE ALWAYS EDUCATED THE YOUNG SO THAT
THEY CAN EARN A LIVILIHOOD AND THAT THESE MEASURES -- POSSIBLY ORDERED
BY MID-LEVEL COMMANDERS -- HINDER THEIR ACTIVITIES AND CAUSES

   BOGOTA, 2 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING "CAPOS,"
THOSE "EXTRADITABLE" TO THE UNITED STATES, "ARE IN COLOMBIA; THEY HAVE
NOT SOUGHT REFUGE ABROAD," NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ
PADILLA TOLD THE PRESS TODAY.

   "I AM SURE THAT THEY ARE IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY.  WE HAVE EVIDENCE
TO THAT EFFECT," THE GENERAL SAID, ADDING THAT THE POLICE "HAVE AN
ENTIRE UNIT READY TO BE TAKEN TO ANY POINT OF THE COUNTRY AT A
MOMENT'S NOTICE" SHOULD ANY OF THE "CAPOS" BE FOUND.

   SOME OF THE 12 "EXTRADITABLES" -- JORGE LUIS, JUAN DAVID, FABIO
OCHOA, PABLO ESCOBAR, GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, AND GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ
OREJUELA -- HAVE BEEN POINTED OUT AS BEING THE KINGPINS OF THE CALI
AND MEDELLIN NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING GROUPS.  THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
EXPORTING 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE USED IN THE UNITED STATES.

   ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT THE POLICE DO NOT HAVE "EXACT
INFORMATION," GEN GOMEZ PADILLA POINTED OUT THAT MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS
SEIZED IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS FROM THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING
ORGANIZATIONS-- INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS, AND PROPERTY TITLES--"ALLOW US
TO PROGRESS IN OUR CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING
NETWORKS."

   THE POLICE CHIEF ADDED THAT "THE POLICE ARE CAREFULLY EVALUATING
THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED.  NO POLITICAL OR PUBLIC FIGURE HAS BEEN FOUND TO
BE INVOLVED WITH NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING AS A RESULT OF THESE PAPERS,"
HE SAID, BUT HE ADMITTED THAT BRIBERY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
"ELEMENTS OF DESTABILIZATION" THAT THE MULTIMILLIONAIRE COCAINE MAFIAS
USE.

   GEN GOMEZ PADILLA ADMITTED THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO BEEN
THE VICTIM OF BRIBERY CASES.  "THANK GOD THERE ARE ONLY A FEW CASES,
JUST FOUR OR FIVE," BUT THESE HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN TIME AND THOSE
FOUND HAVE BEEN PUNISHED.

   HE ALSO SAID THAT "WE HAVE HAD SOME EXEMPLARY MEN WHO HAVE GIVEN
THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL WORK."

   IN THE LAST 3 YEARS, 1,300 POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED WHILE WORKING
ON CASES RELATED TO NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING, GOMEZ PADILLA REPORTED.  HE
ALSO ADMITTED HE HIMSELF HAS RECEIVED DEATH THREATS.

   MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA STRESSED BEFORE THE FOREIGN PRESS THAT
"COLOMBIA IS A SOVEREIGN NATION THAT HAS A VERY QUALIFIED AND
PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES," AND THAT IN ORDER TO FIGHT NARCOTICS
TERRORISM "WE DO NOT NEED FOREIGN FORCES."

   WITH THIS REMARK, GEN GOMEZ AGAIN REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE
UNITED STATES MIGHT SEND TROOPS TO FIGHT THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING
GROUPS IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY.

   "THE FACT WE NEED EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT IS SOMETHING
ELSE," THE POLICE CHIEF SAID, ADDING THAT "WE WELCOME ANY AMOUNT OF
MONEY."

   GOMEZ PADILLA POINTED OUT THAT "AS NEVER BEFORE, THE ARMY, THE
SECRET AGENTS, AND THE POLICE ARE TRULY COMITTED TO THE STRUGGLE AND
HAVE ASSIGNED 80,000 UNITS TO FIGHT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AGAINST
NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING."

   AS OF 18 AUGUST, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED ITS MOST RECENT
 OFFENSIVE AGAINST NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING AND ADOPTED MEASURES THAT
INCLUDED EXTRADITON, THE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF COCAINE "HAS
NEARLY STOPPED," GOMEZ PADILLA SAID.

   THE GENERAL STATED THAT THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS ARE SEEKING NEW
MARKETING ROUTES AND NEW BORDER AREAS TO INSTALL THE COCAINE REFINING
LABORATORIES.

   HE ADDED THE COLOMBIAN TOPOGRAPHY -- MOUNTAINOUS AND WITH VERY
DENSE JUNGLES -- CONCEALS THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS AND THEIR
INSTALLATIONS, "BUT SOONER OR LATER WE ARE GOING TO FIND THEM; THEY
CANNOT HIDE FOREVER."

OF STATE REITERATED THEIR DETERMINATION TO PROMOTE WORLD PEACE AND
INTERNATIONAL CO-PROSPERITY.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO AND PRESIDENT LI TENG-HUI SIGNED ON THE COMMUNIQUE
IN TAIPEI MONDAY MORNING.  THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENTIAL ENTOURAGE LEFT
FOR HOME IN THE AFTERNOON.

   THE COMMUNIQUE SAID THE WORLD COUNTRIES SHOULD RESPECT EACH OTHER'S
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, RESPECT THEIR PEOPLE'S FREEDOM OF CHOICE, AND
REFRAIN FROM INTEFERING WITH DOMESTIC AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

   EVERY COUNTRY'S FOREIGN POLICY SHOULD ALSO BE GOVERNED BY THE
PRINCIPLES OF PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS TO DISPUTES, NOT INVADING OTHERS'
TERRITORIES, AND RESPECTING THE SOVEREIGNTY OF NATURAL RESOURCES OF
INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES, SAID THE COMMUNIQUE.

   CEREZO AND LI EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER ARMAMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL
DISPUTES WHICH MIGHT AGGRAVATE TENSION IN THE WORLD.

   THEY ALSO "STRONGLY DENOUNCED" ALL TERRORIST ACTIONS AND PLANTING
AND PUSHING OF DRUGS, SAYING THE TWO ARE "MAJOR POLLUTIONS OF THE
WORLD."

   THE TWO PRESIDENTS POINTED OUT THAT PEACE EFFORTS REAFFIRMED BY
FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN THREE RECENT SUMMITS TO PROMOTE
MUTUAL RESPECT AND PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE ARE "EXTREMELY IMPORTANT."

   THE ROC AND GUATEMALAN PRESIDENTS SAID THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH THE
SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF BILATERAL TIES, REAFFIRMING THEIR RESOLUTE
DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE AND STRENGTHEN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE PROGRAMS
BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS.

   THEIR JOINT REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS TREATIES AND
ACCORDS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES CONCLUDED THAT THESE BILATERAL
AGREEMENTS HAVE FORMED A BROAD BASE FOR THEM TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR
RESPECTIVE DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT, ACCORDING TO THE COMMUNIQUE.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO THANKED PRESIDENT LI FOR THE ROC'S FINANCIAL,
AGRICULTURAL, INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL ASSISTANCES TO GUATEMALA.
THE TWO SAID THESE COOPERATIVE PROJECTS SHOULD CONTINUE.

   THE TWO HEADS OF STATE ALSO EXPRESSED SATISFACTION OVER INCREASING
EXCHANGES OF VISITS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHICH HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
PROMOTED ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.

   THEY AGREED THAT SUCH EXCHANGES AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION SHOULD
CONTINUE IN ORDER TO BOOST MUTUAL FRIENDSHIP AND BENEFIT THEIR
PEOPLES.

   RECOGNIZING CULTURAL AND SPORTS EXCHANGES' CONTRIBUTION TO
CONSOLIDATING BILATERAL FRIENDSHIP AND PROMOTING PEACE, THE TWO
PRESIDENTS AGREED TO STRENGTHEN THE EXCHANGES BY INCREASING
INVITATIONS AND QUOTA FOR SCHOLARSHIPS.

   CEREZO IN THE MEANTIME CORDIALLY INVITED PRESIDENT LI TO VISIT
GUATEMALA.  THE LATTER ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH GREAT PLEASURE,
AND ASKED THEIR STAFFS TO ARRANGE THE DETAILS.

   DURING HIS STAY HERE, CEREZO HAS BEEN WARMLY AND COURTEOUSLY
WELCOMED AND TREATED.  HE HAS ALSO BEEN CONFERRED AN ODER OF THE
HIGHEST HONOR TO A CIVILIAN LEADER.  BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE, HE GAVE A
PRESS CONFERENCE TO TALK ABOUT HIS VISIT.

   BOGOTA, 4 SEP 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] MEDELLIN -- AN
BOMBING ATTACK ATTACK ON 3 AUGUST OCCURRED AT A BRANCH OF BANCO
POPULAR, AT THE INTERSECTION OF 49TH AVENUE AND 50TH STREET, ITAGUI
MUNICIPALITY, TO THE SOUTH OF ABURRA VALLEY. FIVE INDIVIDUALS WERE
INJURED, AND SEVERE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE OCCURRED.

   THE INJURED WERE 19-YEAR-OLD ROBINSON RAMIREZ, 30-YEAR-OLD ROBERTO
ARCESIO PABON, AND 40-YEAR-OLD HUGO MORALES, AND TWO OTHER
UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE TREATED AT ITAGUI'S SAN RAFAEL
HOSPITAL AND OTHER HOSPITALS IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT'S CAPITAL.

   AN OFFICIAL REPORT STATES THAT THE BLAST COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE
BANK FACILITIES AND CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO NEARBY BUSINESSES AND
SEVERAL AREA RESIDENCES.

   IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THIS NEW ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT A FEW
MINUTES BEFORE THE 5TH DAY OF A CURFEW, WHICH WAS ORDERED ON 30 AUGUST
BY THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.  IN ORDERING A CURFEW, THE MUNICIPAL
GOVERNMENT FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ.

PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND 12 WERE WOUNDED TODAY, INCLUDING 3 MEMBERS OF
THE ANTIOQUIA POLICE, IN AN ATTACK AT THE JOSE MARIA CORDOBA AIRPORT
IN RIONEGRO.

   SEVERAL MEN TRAVELING IN TWO VEHICLES ARRIVED AT THE AIRPORT'S MAIN
ENTRANCE AT 0715 DURING THE USUAL MORNING RUSH HOUR.  ONE OF THEM,
WEARING COLOMBIAN ARMY FATIGUES, GOT OUT OF A RED RENAULT AND
INDISCRIMINATELY OPENED FIRE ON THE PEOPLE WHO WERE UNDERGOING ROUTINE
SEARCHES AT THE AIRPORT ENTRANCE.  ONE PERSON WAS KILLED, AND 12 WERE
WOUNDED.  THE AIRPORT SECURITY POLICE THEN KILLED THE ATTACKER.  THERE
WAS GENERAL CHAOS AT THE AIRPORT, A SITUATION THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED A
GREATER TRAGEDY.  THE MOTIVES AND THE IDENTITIES OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE NEW VIOLENCE ARE SO FAR UNKNOWN.

   IN A LAST MINUTE REPORT, WE HAVE LEARNED THAT AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE
WAS ALSO DEFUSED IN THE JOSE MARIA CORDOBA AIPORT IN RIONEGRO.

HERCULES PLANE HAS BEEN DYNAMITED IN MONTERIA.  ACCORDING TO THE DAS
[ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY], THE AIRPLANE BELONGS TO THE
DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.  THE PLANE HAD BEEN FLYING TO CALI LAST WEEK,
BUT IT HAD TO LAND AT THE LOS GARZONES AIRPORT, LOCATED 10 MINUTES
FROM MONTERIA, AFTER DEVELOPING MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES.

   THE C-123 HERCULES PLANE WAS DYNAMITED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS AS
IT SAT IN A DARK SECTION OF THE LOS GARZONES AIRPORT OF MONTERIA.
AIRPORT SOURCES SAID THE GRAY PLANE HAD BEEN IN ROUTE TO CALI LAST
WEEK, BUT ITS CREW HAD TO LEAVE IT IN MONTERIA BECAUSE OF ITS
MECHANICAL DEFECTS.  THE POWERFUL DYNAMITE CHARGE WAS PLACED
UNDERNEATH THE PLANE.  THE EXPLOSION DESTROYED A LARGE PART OF THE
CABIN, INSTRUMENT PANEL, AND CONTROLS.  THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED DURING
A HEAVY DOWNPOUR.  THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THERE WERE NO
CASUALTIES.

   THE AIRPLANE WAS UNDER SPECIAL PROTECTION, BUT THE GUARDS WERE
INSIDE THE AIRPORT WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED.  ONLY THE AIRPORT
PERSONNEL AND CIVIL AERONAUTICS WATCHMEN WERE AT THE TERMINAL WHEN THE
EXPLOSION OCCURRED.

   MOSCOW (USSR), NO DATE -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] FULLY AWARE OF OUR
RESPONSIBILITY AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE, THE PCCH AND THE
LEFTIST SECTOR, AS PART OF THE OPPOSITION, WILL SPARE NO SACRIFICE TO
SECURE AN IMPORTANT VICTORY BY ELECTING PATRICIO AYLWIN PRESIDENT OF
THE REPUBLIC AND ESTABLISHING A DECISIVE MAJORITY IN CONGRESS FOR THE
OPPOSITION, INCLUDING THE UNITED LEFT AND THE PAIS [BROAD PARTY OF THE
SOCIALIST LEFT].

   IN OUR OPINION, SAID VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, THIS IS NOT JUST AN
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.  WE DO NOT SEE IT AS SEPARATE FROM THE SOCIAL
MOBILIZATION CARRIED OUT BY PEOPLE BURDENED BY HUNDREDS OF DAILY
PROBLEMS, A MOBILIZATION TO RECOVER THEIR RIGHTS TO FOOD, JOBS,
HEALTH, HOUSING, AND EDUCATION -- TO A WAY OF LIFE WORTHY OF HUMAN
BEINGS.

   FIVE OR SIX MILLION HUNGRY AND POOR CHILEANS IS A SCANDAL, AND THEY
DESERVE A SHARE OF THE WEALTH OF THOSE WHO TOOK OVER THE COUNTRY'S
GOVERNMENT.

   WE NEED TO DEMAND AND DEFEND THE RESPECT FOR LIFE THAT HAS NOT BEEN
GUARANTEED DURING THESE PAST 16 YEARS IN OUR FATHERLAND.  A SINGLE DAY
DOES NOT GO BY WITHOUT A DEFENDER OF FREEDOM BECOMING A VICTIM OF THE
REGIME'S REPRESSIVE APPARATUS.

   THE COMMUNIST REPRESENTATIVE ADDED: WE WANT PEACE FOR CHILE.  WE
WANT THE DEADLY VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM UNLEASHED ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973
TO END ONCE AND FOR ALL.

   THE CHILEAN DILEMMA CONTINUES TO BE DEMOCRACY OR DICTATORSHIP,
LIBERTY OR TYRANNY, PERPETUATION IN POWER OR A NEW LIFE.  VOLODIA
TEITELBOIM HAS INDEED MADE A CALL TO GET ORGANIZED, TO UNITE, AND TO
CONVINCE.  THE PERPETUATION OF POWER IS NOW CALLED HERNAN BUCHI.  WE
MUST ALL UNITE TO DEFEAT PINOCHET.  BUCHI IS HIS MAN.

   TEITELBOIM POINTED OUT THAT THE PEOPLE DID NOT MAKE A MISTAKE.
THEY JUST HAD TO CHANGE A LETTER OF BUCHI'S PROPAGANDISTIC SLOGANS TO
RESTORE THE TRUTH: BUCHI IS NOT THE MAN; RATHER, HE REPRESENTS HUNGER.

   IN ITS 15TH CONGRESS THE PCCH MADE A CALL TO DEFEAT THE MINISTER
WHO HAS MADE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE POOR, THE MINISTER WHO HAS NOW BECOME
A DEMAGOGUE AND IS PROMISING THE MOON AND AN UNREALISTIC WORLD FOR THE
PEOPLE; THAT IS, THE MINISTER WHO IS PROMISING EVERYTHING HE FAILED TO
ACCOMPLISH IN HIS YEARS AS MINISTER.

   BUCHI'S INSINCERE PROMISES ARE SURPASSED ONLY BY ANOTHER TALKATIVE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE REGIME: MR ERRAZURIZ.

   VOLODIA TEITELBOIM THEN ADDED: IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE VICTORY OF
DEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE UNITED FORCES OF ALL THOSE
WHO HOPE FOR LIBERTY.

   WE HEREBY CALL FOR THE CREATION OF MILLIONS OF COMMANDOS FOR
DEMOCRACY AND BROAD COMMITTEES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DISPLAY
INITIATIVES, ENCOURAGE IMAGINATION, AND FORM CARAVANS OF PEOPLE WHO
WILL GIVE EXPLANATIONS FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND FROM PERSON TO PERSON,
IMPLEMENTING A FERVENT AND OVERWHELMING DYNAMIC CAPABLE OF CHANGING
CHILE ON 14 DECEMBER 1989.

   OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS PLAYED AN OUTSTANDING ROLE IN THE CRUCIAL
CROSSROADS OF THE 20TH CENTURY.  THEY ARE PLAYING IT NOW, FIGHTING
WHOLEHEARTEDLY, CONVINCED THAT THE VICTORY OF DEMOCRACY WILL REPRESENT
A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, AN EMPHATIC AND
RIGHTEOUS NO TO IMPUNITY, AND A SUBSTANTIVE YES TO LIBERTY FOR ALL
POLITICAL PRISONERS AND TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI [NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE CENTER].

   THE OUTSTANDING COMMUNIST LEADER AND INTELLECTUAL SAID THAT THESE
ARE DAYS FOR GENEROSITY AND SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR.  SEEKING DEMOCRACY, WE
ARE SHAKING HANDS WITH ALL THOSE WITH WHOM WE HAVE HAD DISAGREEMENTS
IN THE PAST.  WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS.  ALTHOUGH WE ARE MOTIVATED BY
DIFFERENT POLITICAL CONCEPTS, THIS IS A CREATIVE TIME FOR A COMMON
DENOMINATOR, JOINT ACTIONS, AND FOR EVERYONE TO LEND A HAND.

   IF THE OPPOSITION MARCHES UNITED TOWARD 14 DECEMBER, IT WILL
ACHIEVE A OVERWHELMING VICTORY THAT WILL BE REGISTERED IN CHILEAN
HISTORY AS A GOLDEN DATE OF EXTRAORDINARY SIGNIFICANCE.

   SUCH A VICTORY WILL FINALLY RESTORE A RIGHT THAT HAS REPEATEDLY
BEEN REQUESTED AND VIOLATED: THE RIGHT TO REJOICE AND TO TRUST IN THE
FUTURE WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT NO ONE WILL SLIP UNNOTICED THROUGH THE
SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT TO KILL A CHILEAN WITH IMPUNITY.

   THE PEOPLE, ADDED VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, ARE BEGINNING TO PAINT THE
WALLS WITH A SLOGAN: THE PEOPLE WIN, THE DICTATORSHIP IS OVER.  THE
DICTATORSHIP WILL END AND THE PEOPLE WILL WIN.

   IF WE WIN IN 14 DECEMBER AND DOUBTLESSLY WE WILL, AND IF WE --
ALWAYS ACTING IN UNISON -- IMMEDIATELY SPOIL PINOCHET'S PLANS, WE WILL
[WORD INDISTINCT] THEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENT OR THE PERPETUAL
BOSS.

   THE TOP LEADER OF CHILEAN COMMUNISTS WARNED THAT THE DANGERS AND
DIFFICULTIES DEMAND THAT WE REMAIN ALERT AND WORK EVEN HARDER.  WE
MUST BURY ALL ATTEMPTS BY THE GENERAL AND HIS FAITHFULS TO STOP OR
REVERSE CHILE'S PROGRESS TOWARD NEW HORIZONS.

   VOLODIA TEITELBOIM POINTED OUT THAT PATRICIO AYLWIN, DURING A
MEETING AT THE OPENING CEREMONY FOR THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PARTY OFFICES,
EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A TRULY DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT THAT WILL MAKE ALL CHILEANS ACTIVE AGAIN IN DEMOCRATIC
LIFE.  THIS PURPOSE REFLECTS THE SENTIMENTS OF A VAST MAJORITY OF THE
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TURN THE BLOODY PAGE OF THE DICTATORSHIP AND PUT AN
END TO POLITICAL AND SOCIAL NEGLECT AND TO THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN
HUMANS, BETWEEN PARIAHS AND PRIVILEGED ONES, AND BETWEEN FIRST-CLASS,
SECOND-CLASS, OR THIRD-CLASS PEOPLE, WHERE SOME ENJOY EVERY RIGHT
WHILE OTHERS ARE DENIED EVEN THE RIGHT TO LIVE.

   IN HIS SPEECH OVER A PARTIAL RADIO NETWORK, THE PCCH SECRETARY
GENERAL SAID: WE DREAM ABOUT AND STRIVE FOR A CHILE WITHOUT MISSING
PEOPLE, WITHOUT EXECUTED PEOPLE, WITHOUT BURNED YOUTHS, WITHOUT
POLITICAL PRISONERS, WITHOUT EXILES -- A FATHERLAND OF EQUALS AMONG
EQUALS.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 4 SEP 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] OFFICIALS FROM COLOMBIA'S AVIANCA
AIRLINE DENIED REPORTS TODAY THAT A BOMB HAD BEEN FOUND AND DEFUSED
INSIDE ONE OF ITS AIRPLANES IN THE CITY OF MEDELLIN.  THIS REPORT IS
RELATED TO THE "WAR" THAT THE DRUGTRAFFICKING MAFIA HAS DECLARED ON
THE COUNTRY, A WAR THAT HAS BEEN INTENSIFIED IN RECENT HOURS.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, POLICE ANTI-EXPLOSIVE EXPERTS DEFUSED A
POWERFUL CHARGE OF DYNAMITE FOUND IN AN AVIANCA 727 PLANE THAT ARRIVED
IN MEDELLIN FROM PEREIRA WITH 180 PASSENGERS ABOARD.

   THE REPORT, BROADCAST BY A TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAM AFTER HAVING
BEEN CONFIRMED BY A CIVIL AERONAUTICS OFFICIAL, STATED THAT THE BOMB
WAS FOUND BY THE PLANE'S CREW MEMBERS AFTER THEY DETECTED A HEAVY
SMELL OF POWDER SHORTLY AFTER LANDING.

   THIS SITUATION, WHICH HAS BEEN BLAMED ON THE "NERVOUSNESS" THE
COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING, TOOK PLACE ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTER A MAN
DRESSED IN A CAMOUFLAGE MILITARY UNIFORM KILLED 1 PERSON AND WOUNDED
13 OTHERS WITH A MACHINEGUN AT MEDELLIN'S JOSE MARIA CORDOBA
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

   THE KILLER, WHOSE POSSIBLE TIES WITH DRUG-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS
ARE BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE AUTHORITIES, FIRED INDISCRIMINATELY ON

   MEDELLIN, 4 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A NEW TERRORIST ACTION SHOOK
MEDELLIN IN NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA THIS EVENING WHEN TWO MEN RIDING ON
A MOTORCYCLE THREW AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AT A POLICE POST LOCATED IN THE
EXCLUSIVE SUBURB OF EL POBLADO.  MIRACULOUSLY, THE THREE POLICEMEN AND
TWO CIVILIANS WHO WERE INSIDE ESCAPED INJURY.

   THE POST, KNOWN AS AN IMMEDIATE ATTENTION CENTER (CAI), WHICH PLAYS
THE ROLE OF A POLICE CONTROL POST, WAS DESTROYED BY THE EXPLOSION OF
THE DEVICE.

   THREE POLICEMEN AND TWO CIVILIANS WERE INSIDE THE POST, WHICH WAS
NOT FULLY OPERATIONAL BECAUSE IT HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETELY BUILT, BUT
MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

   ONE OF THE POLICEMEN TOLD AFP THAT THEY SAW TWO MEN ON A MOTORCYCLE
SWIFTLY PASSING BY THE CAI AND THEN THROWING A RED PLASTIC BAG.

   THE THREE POLICEMEN AND THE TWO CIVILIANS MANAGED TO RUN A FEW
METERS DOWN THE STREET BEFORE THE DEVICE EXPLODED.

   ALTHOUGH THE DEVICE'S POWER HAS YET TO BE ESTABLISHED BY EXPERTS,
THE DETONATION WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO DESTROY THE STRUCTURE, MEASURING
APPROXIMATELY 11 SQUARE METERS.

   PRECISELY 1 MONTH AGO THE SAME CAI HAD BEEN DESTROYED WHEN ITS
WALLS WERE BEING CONSTRUCTED.

   A WOMAN WHO PASSED THROUGH THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK WAS
NOT INJURED EITHER, EVEN THOUGH HER VEHICLE SUSTAINED CONSIDERABLE
DAMAGE, PARTICULARLY THE WINDOWS, WHICH WERE DESTROYED.

   THE NEW TERRORIST ACTION OCCURRED 12 HOURS AFTER A MAN WAS INVOLVED
IN A SPECTACULAR SHOOT-OUT AT THE JOSE MARIA CORDOBA AIRPORT IN
MEDELLIN, WHERE THE GUNMAN AND A YOUNG MAN DIED AND 10 PERSONS WERE
WOUNDED, INCLUDING THREE POLICEMEN.

   THE CAI'S DESTRUCTION OCCURRED 4 HOURS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE
CURFEW, IMPOSED BY MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ 6 DAYS AGO IN AN ATTEMPT
TO CURTAIL THE TERRORIST ACTIONS WHICH HAVE SHAKEN THE CITY,
BIRTHPLACE OF THE MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL.

LEADER OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT, MIR, DIED INSTANTLY
LAST NIGHT WHEN HE WAS HIT BY 12 BULLETS FIRED FROM 2 DIFFERENT

AND THE PEOPLE. YELLOW AND BOURGEOIS [AS HEARD].

   ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATORS, NEGHME'S BODY RECEIVED 18 BULLET
WOUNDS, CAUSED BY 12 DIRECT HITS. THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY A
GROUP OF ARMED INDIVIDUALS IN A MOVING CAR. NOTHING IS KNOWN ABOUT THE
ATTACKERS.

   CARABINEROS PERSONNEL WENT TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME AFTER
RECEIVING A TELEPHONE CALL. HOMICIDE EXPERTS FROM THE CIVILIAN POLICE
ARRIVED A LITTLE LATER. THEY IMMEDIATELY CONDUCTED THE APPROPRIATE
INVESTIGATIONS WHERE THE MIR SPOKESMAN WAS GUNNED DOWN.  NEGHME WAS
KILLED SOME 50 METERS FROM THE BERNARDO O'HIGGINS PROMENADE, AT 10
WEST BULNES STREET. THE STREET IS POORLY ILLUMINATED. IT IS BELIEVED
THAT THERE WERE NO EYEWITNESSES OF THE CRIME.

   ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, TWO AUTOMATIC WEAPONS WERE USED; ONE A
7.65-MM AND THE OTHER A 9-MM. THE POLICE ADDED THAT NEGHME WAS NOT
CARRYING A WEAPON. A BRIEFCASE FOUND NEAR HIS BODY CONTAINED SOME

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [REPORT] [RICHARD JACOBSEN]
[TEXT] A SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT COMMISSION WILL MEET WITH LEFTIST
REBELS BEFORE 15 SEPTEMBER IN A PRELIMINARY DIALOGUE TO END ALMOST 10
YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, IT WAS REPORTED TODAY BY A HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL.

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WILL ANNOUNCE ON 7 SEPTEMBER THE
CREATION OF A COMMISSION AND THE DATE AND PLACE OF THE TALKS WITH THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) REPRESENTATIVES, IT
WAS STATED BY COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER MAURICIO SANDOVAL.

   "THE MEETING WILL BE HELD BEFORE 15 SEPTEMBER," SANDOVAL TOLD
REUTER.

   SANDOVAL'S STATEMENTS WERE GIVEN AFTER FMLN COMMANDER ANA GUADALUPE
MARTINEZ SAID TODAY IN MEXICO CITY THAT THE REBELS HAD ACCEPTED A
GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL TO HOLD TALKS BEFORE 15 SEPTEMBER, THE ANNIVERSARY
OF EL SALVADOR'S INDEPENDENCE.

   "WE THINK THAT THE MEETING COULD BE HELD IN MEXICO CITY, AND ON 7
SEPTEMBER WE WILL ANNOUNCE A SERIES OF MEASURES TO FACILITATE THE
DIALOGUE" -- THE FIRST BETWEEN CRISTIANI'S RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT AND
THE FMLN, MARTINEZ SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE.

   SHE DID NOT RULE OUT THE DECLARATION OF AN UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE.
"PERHAPS YES, PERHAPS NO," MARTINEZ ANSWERED WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT.

   SANDOVAL SAID THAT THE TALKS COULD BE HELD IN COSTA RICA OR MEXICO.

   "IT IS ALMOST SURE THAT THE TALKS WILL BE HELD IN MEXICO," HE SAID.

   SANDOVAL SAID THAT THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED TOWARD THE TALKS WAS PROOF
OF THE PLEDGE ASSUMED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS SWORN IN ON 1 JUNE
TO SOLVE A CONFLICT WHICH HAS COST EL SALVADOR MORE THAN 70,000 LIVES.

   "SPECIFIC STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE," HE SAID.

   GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE EMPHASIZED THAT THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS
WILL PROBABLY PREPARE THE GROUNDWORK FOR FUTURE, MORE SUBSTANTIAL,
TALKS.

   SANDOVAL DID NOT SAY WHO WOULD COMPRISE THE GOVERNMENT'S DIALOGUE
COMMISSION BUT OFFICIALS HAD PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND
THE CHURCH WOULD NOT BE REPRESENTED -- A PREVIOUS FMLN DEMAND.

   "WE ACCEPT THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION THAT WILL ATTEND THE
DIALOGUE BE COMPOSED AS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS," COMMANDER MARTINEZ SAID
TODAY.  "WE BELIEVE IT IS NEGATIVE FOR THE ARMY NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN
A DIALOGUE WHERE THE WAR WILL BE DISCUSSED.  IT WILL BE A MISTAKE FOR
THE MILITARY NOT TO ATTEND THE MEETING."

   VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO TOLD REPORTERS ON 4 SEPTEMBER THAT
THE ARMED FORCES -- AND THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES -- WOULD BE
INCLUDED IN WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A "SUPPORT COMMISSION" THAT WOULD
PLAY AN ADVISORY ROLE IN THE TALKS.

   THREE ROUNDS OF TALKS BETWEEN THE FMLN AND PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON
DUARTE'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, WHICH CONCLUDED ITS TERM ON
1 JUNE, FAILED TO ACHIEVE PROGRESS TOWARD THE SOLUTION OF A CIVIL WAR.

   TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF A PEACE DIALOGUE OCCURRED AMID FIERCE
CLASHES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS AND REBELS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF EL
SALVADOR.

   A MAJOR CLASH OCCURRED IN EASTERN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT, WHERE THE
REBELS KILLED 14 SOLDIERS AND 2 OFFICERS.

FMLN FIGHTERS' PRESENCE AT THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL IS AN INDICATION
THAT FMLN LEADERS ABANDON THEIR FIGHTERS WHEN THEY CEASE TO BE USEFUL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MONTANO] I BELIEVE THAT IF THE FMLN WANTED TO
SEND THOSE PEOPLE ABROAD, AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, THEY COULD
VERY WELL HAVE DONE SO.  THEY HAVE THE FIGHTERS AT THE CATHEDRAL FOR
PROPAGANDA PURPOSES, AND TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS
INHUMANE.  I HAVE EVEN READ AND HEARD STATEMENTS BY FMLN ALLIES WHO
SAY THAT THE SITUATION OF THE MAIMED CANNOT BE NEGOTIATED FOR
HUMANITARIAN REASONS.  HOWEVER, DID THEY DISPLAY HUMANENESS WHEN THEY
BURNED BUSES, LEFT THE PEOPLE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, OR DESTROYED SO
MANY THINGS THAT BENEFIT THE PUBLIC? [END RECORDING]

   REFERRING TO THE HOMILY DELIVERED YESTERDAY BY MONSIGNOR GREGORIO
ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, WHO ACCUSED THE AIR
FORCE OF BOMBING THE SANTA ELENA CHURCH IN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, COL
MONTANO SAID THAT SOME LEFTIST CLERGYMEN DISTORT THE FACTS FOR
PROPAGANDA PURPOSES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MONTANO] WITH THEIR HUMANITARIAN IMAGE, THEY
OFTEN OPPOSE THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, THEY OPPOSE THE COUNTRY'S
DEMOCRATIZATION AND, IN FACT, THEY OFTEN PLAY UP TO THE FMLN.  IN
REALITY THEIR ATTACKS AND DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT THE ARMED FORCES
ARE UNFAIR.  THEY BLAME THE ARMY FOR THINGS IT IS NOT GUILTY OF OR
RESPONSIBLE FOR. [END RECORDING]

GOVERNMENT AFFIRMED TODAY THAT MANY OF THE SALVADORAN REFUGEES IN
HONDURAS ARE LINKED TO THE GUERRILLAS BUT THAT HE WILL MAKE A "GOOD
WILL" GESTURE TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY 3,800 OF THEM REPATRIATED.

   "THE GOVERNMENT IS MAKING A GOOD WILL GESTURE BY ACCEPTING THE
REPATRIATION OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHILE KNOWING THAT MANY OF
THEM ARE RELATIVES OF CRIMINAL TERRORISTS (GUERRILLAS), SAID
SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT AND INTERIOR MINISTER FRANCISCO MERINO.

   THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND HONDURAS AND THE UN HIGH
COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES ARE PREPARING THE RETURN OF THESE
SALVADORANS WHO FLED TO HONDURAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE TO
ESCAPE FROM THE ARMED CONFLICT.

   MERINO STATED: "WE WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF AT ANY GIVEN
MOMENT THERE WAS A JUSTIFICATION FOR RESORTING TO VIOLENCE, NOW, 10
YEARS LATER, THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION AT ALL AND THE MOMENT HAS COME
FOR BEGINNING A NORMAL LIFE."

   ACCORDING TO THE VICE PRESIDENT, THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NO MALES
AMONG THESE REFUGEES IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE LINKS WITH THE
GUERRILLAS.

   ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT FIND MEN OF OVER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THERE WERE
MANY PREGNANT WOMEN," MERINO TOLD THE PRESS.

   THE GOVERNMENT SELECTED SETTLEMENT AREAS FOR THE REPATRIATED, WHERE
IT WILL GIVE THEM MEDICAL AND EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND A FUNCTIONING
INFRASTRUCTURE.

   FOR THEIR PART, THE REFUGEES HAVE ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO
THEIR PLACES OF ORIGIN, IN WAR-TORN AREAS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF
CHALATENANGO, SAN MIGUEL, AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS, OR IN LA UNION
DEPARTMENT.

   "TO SEND THEM THERE," MERINO SAID, "WOULD BE TO CONDEMN THEM TO
PERMANENT UNDERDEVELOPMENT.  THEY WANT TO RETURN TO PLACES THAT DO NOT
PROVIDE WHAT IS NEEDED FOR DEVELOPMENT OR FOR A NORMAL LIFE."

   THE CHRISTIAN COMMITTEE FOR DISPLACED SALVADORANS, WHICH CLAIMS TO
REPRESENT THE REFUGEES, HAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF WANTING TO SEND
THE REPATRIATED TO "CONCENTRATION CAMPS GUARDED BY THE ARMED FORCES."

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 5 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE EXTENSIVE BORDER
SHARED BY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA IS TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, THE CAUSE
OF CONCERN FOR THE CARACAS GOVERNMENT.  THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING ORDERED BY PRESIDENT BARCO IS VIEWED BY LOCAL COMMENTATORS
AS A DANGEROUS THREAT TO VENEZUELA DUE TO ITS PROXIMITY TO COLOMBIA,
WITH WHOM VENEZUELA SHARES OVER 2,000 KM.

   THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR
VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENTS.  ON SEVERAL OCASSIONS VENEZUELA HAD TO FACE
RAIDS INTO ITS TERRITORY, AS WELL AS THE KIDNAPPING OF STOCKBREEDERS,
SMUGGLING OF GOODS, AND DRUG TRAFFICKING BY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND
CRIMINALS.  THE WAR DECLARED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY THAT MANY OF THE DRUG
CHIEFTAINS, AND PERHAPS SOME DRUG KINGPINS, MAY SEEK REFUGE IN
VENEZUELAN TERRITORY.

   VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WARNED THAT IF DRUG
TRAFFICKERS ATTEMPT TO TRANSFER THEIR INDUSTRIES TO VENEZUELA THEY
WILL HAVE TO "FACE VENEZUELAN JUSTICE, AND CERTAINLY EXTRADITION
TRIALS." THE STATES OF ZULIA, TACHIRA, AND APURE --IN WESTERN
VENEZUELA -- BORDER COLOMBIAN TERRITORY AND HAVE BEEN THE SCENE OF
DRUG TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS MANY TIMES.  IN THE PAST FEW DAYS
VENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES HAVE INCREASED VIGILANCE AT THE MAIN BORDER
POSTS BECAUSE OF RUMORS THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BEGUN MOVING TO
VENEZUELA.

   GOVERNOR OF ZULIA STATE ISMAEL ORDAZ CONFIRMED TO NEWSMEN THAT THE
GOVERNMENT HAS INTENSIFIED CONTROL AND VIGILANCE MEASURES AT THE
BORDER WITH COLOMBIA.  HE NOTED THERE IS BROAD COOPERATION BETWEEN THE
VENEZUELAN AND COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.

   DURING A RADIO PROGRAM ON MONDAY, 4 SEPTEMBER, JOURNALIST JOSE
VICENTE RANGEL, FORMER MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE, MAINTAINED THAT IT IS NOT AT THIS TIME THAT DRUG
TRAFFICKERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER VENEZUELA BECAUSE THEY ENTERED A
LONG TIME AGO.  RANGEL MAINTAINED THAT VENEZUELA ANNUALLY SERVES AS A
BRIDGE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING WORTH SOME $20 BILLION.  FURTHERMORE, HE
SAID, THE EXPENSIVE VENEZUELAN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HAVE ALSO RECEIVED
RESOURCES OBTAINED FROM DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   THE FIGURES GIVEN BY RANGEL ARE EQUIVALENT TO 66 PERCENT OF THE
VENEZUELAN FOREIGN DEBT, WHICH AMOUNTS TO SOME $30 MILLION THAT THE
GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY TRYING TO RENEGOTIATE.  MOREOVER, RANGEL SAID,
DURING THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THAT CONCLUDED WITH THE ELECTION OF
CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IN DECEMBER 1988, POLITICAL PARTIES INVESTED SOME
5 BILLION BOLIVARES (SOME $135 MILLION) IN PROPAGANDA.  THIS FIGURE IS
EXCESSIVE IF ONE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT, AS ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW,
THE STATE ONLY CONTRIBUTES 100 MILLION BOLIVARES ($2.7 MILLION) FOR
THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HELD EVERY 5 YEARS.

   RANGEL ADDED THAT THE POSSIBLE TRANSFER OF COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKING OPERATION CENTERS TO VENEZUELA IS VERY WORRYING IF ONE
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE OPENLY
ADMITTED THE LACK OF VIGILANCE AT THE BORDERS.  HOWEVER, WHILE
COLOMBIA IS ATTEMPTING, PERHAPS BELATEDLY, NOT TO YIELD TO THE
ECONOMIC POWER AND VIOLENCE OF DRUGS, THERE SEEMS TO BE NO AWARENESS
IN VENEZUELA ABOUT THE GRAVE DANGER POSED BY THE ALLEGED CHANGE OF
ADDRESS WHICH, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, IS BEING PLANNED BY
COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   LIMA, NO DATE (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [GARCIA] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] IT IS CLEAR THAT NEO-LIBERALISM IS THE IDEOLOGY OF THE
NORTH.  IF IN THE PAST LIBERALISM WAS A FACTOR THAT PROMOTED PROGRESS
AND INDEPENDENCE IN LATIN AMERICA, NEO- LIBERALISM IS NOW THE STATE
IDEOLOGY OF THE MORE POWERFUL NATIONS.  IT IS AN AUTHORITARIAN
IDEOLOGY THAT DOES NOT QUESTION ALL TYPES OF STATES, BUT ONLY THE
STATES OF THE SOUTH.  UNDER THE GUISE OF ELIMINATING BUREAUCRACY AND
PROMOTING EFFICIENCY, NEO-LIBERALISM WANTS TO DESTROY THE STATE TO
ELIMINATE ANY RESISTANCE TO THE HEGEMONY OF THE WORLD MARKET.

   WE SHOULD NOT PLAY THAT GAME.  IDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT SHOULD
THEREFORE REDEFINE THE STATE AND DEFEND ITS STRENGTH IN OUR COUNTRIES.

   WHEN I SAY STATE I AM NOT REFERRING MERELY TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES
THAT EVERY ONE OF US REPRESENTS.  I AM REFERRING TO AN ACCORD THAT OUR
STATES SHOULD REACH IN EACH REGION.  WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE
UNITED IN CONTINENTAL BLOCS.  WE MUST PROMOTE OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY.

   ONLY THROUGH REGIONAL INITIATIVES WILL WE HAVE POWER IN THE CURRENT
PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING THE MARKET.  IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO
CALL -- IN EACH CONTINENT -- MORE FREQUENT AND REGULAR MEETINGS OF OUR
MOVEMENT.  WE MUST ORGANIZE THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ON A CONTINENTAL
BASIS TO STRENGTHEN IT IN ALL PLACES.

   MANY HAVE COME TO THIS MEETING TO PROPOSE AN ADMINISTRATIVE
STRUCTURE FOR OUR MOVEMENT TO INSURE ITS CONTINUITY.  THIS CAN BE
VIEWED AS A SUGGESTION.  IT IS A LOT MORE IMPORTANT, THOUGH, TO
RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND TO CREATE
INTERMEDIATE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS WHEREVER POSSIBLE.
THESE INTERMEDIATE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE PRINCIPLES OF
THE MOVEMENT IN EACH REGION, THUS EXPANDING ITS POWER.

   ALTHOUGH IT'S TAKEN SOMETIME, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY
ADOPTED THIS APPROACH IN LATIN AMERICA THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE
POLITICAL CONSULTATION MECHANISM OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH GIVES
COMMON ANSWERS TO THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND TO POLITICAL INTERVENTION.

   MR PRESIDENT, IN HONORING OUR FOUNDERS -- TITO, NEHRU, AND NASSER
-- I SHOULD STRESS THE ETHICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF NONALIGNMENT.  WITHOUT
THE POWER OF NUCLEAR BOMBS OR MONEY, WE HAVE UPHELD THE MORAL VALUES
OF MANKIND TO HELP IT TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN ALL FIELDS.

   THEREFORE, OUR MOVEMENT CANNOT REMAIN INDIFFERENT TO THE VERY
SERIOUS PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ADDICTION, WHICH HAS
SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD.

   IT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS RICH
COUNTRIES, BECAUSE DRUG ADDICTION REFLECTS THE MOST REFINED STAGE OF
CONSUMPTION, THE CONSUMPTION OF INSATISFACTION.  YET IT IS ALSO TRUE
THAT WE, AS DRUG PRODUCERS OR DEALERS, ARE INVOLUNTARY PARTNERS.  LIKE
NEO- LIBERALISM, DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS PERVERSELY TRIED TO TAKE OVER.

   DRUG TRAFFICKING IS ALSO A FORM OF HEGEMONY BY THE LARGE RICH
MARKETS, WHICH ARE THEREBY DISTORTING AND CORRUPTING OUR SOCIETY.
DRUG TRAFFICKING ALSO SEEKS TO DESTROY STATES, AS IT IS NOW DOING IN
COLOMBIA.

   I BELIEVE WE SHOULD RAISE THE BANNER OF MANKIND'S MORAL VALUES; WE
SHOULD TELL THE RICH THAT EVEN IF THEY IGNORE OUR CLAIMS FOR JUSTICE,
WE WILL NOT IGNORE THEIR YOUTH AND THEIR CHILDREN, WHO MUST BE
DEFENDED FROM DRUG ADDICTION.

   THE U.S. PRESIDENT WILL FORMULATE A PROPOSAL ON THE SUBJECT
TOMORROW, AND WE HOPE IT WILL BE AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING PROPOSAL.

   THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST OVER HELICOPTERS AN AMMUNITION.  IT
INVOLVES AN ACCORD BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, ON ONE SIDE,
AND THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED ON THE OTHER.

   THE PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, IN PARTICULAR, CALLS FOR STRUCTURAL
TREATMENT, WITHOUT WHICH ANY MILITARY AID WILL BE INSUFFICIENT.

   OUR MOVEMENT MUST ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND
UNDERTAKE JOINT MEASURES TO ERADICATE IT.  THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT
MUST ALSO ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT
IS LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS IN PERU.

   FAITHFUL TO ITS MORAL PRINCIPLES, THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT SHOULD
STRONGLY REJECT DRUG ADDICTION AND DEATH.  THIS WILL SHOW THAT OUR
NATIONS' RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY IS AS STRONG AS THAT OF THE MOST
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

   MR PRESIDENT: WE CAME TO THIS SUMMIT FROM PERU TO REITERATE OUR
FAITH IN NONALIGNMENT, OUR ANTI-IMPERIALIST POSITION AGAINST
COLONIALISM AND INTERVENTIONISM, AND OUR DECISION TO SIDE WITH THE
NATIONS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND JUSTICE.  WE CAME TO DEFEND
IDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT.  WE CAME TO DEMAND FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT AND
THE RECOGNITION OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE DEBT.  WE ARE HERE TO
REITERATE OUR ALLEGIANCE TO THE IMMORTAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE UNITED
BEHIND 28 YEARS AGO.

   I SALUTE THE NATIONS OF THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT.  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. [APPLAUSE]

   MEDELLIN, 5 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] A RADIO STATION NEWSMAN HAS
REPORTED THAT AN ALLEGED SPOKESMAN FOR "THE EXTRADITABLES," A GROUP
THAT CLAIMS TO BE LINKED TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, HAS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BURNING OF A RESTAURANT TODAY AND A 5 SEPTEMBER
SHARPSHOOTER ATTACK AT THE LOCAL AIRPORT.

   A NEWSMAN FROM RADIO CARACOL OF MEDELLIN REPORTED RECEIVING A
TELEPHONE CALL FROM A MEMBER OF THE EXTRADITABLES CLAIMING
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BURNING OF A COUNTRYSIDE RESTRAURANT. THE
CALLER JUSTIFIED THIS ACTION BY SAYING THAT THE RESTARANTS' OWNERS
PAID HOMAGE TO A MILITARY LEADER.

   MEDELLIN, WHICH IS THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS' TRADING HEADQUARTERS IN
COLOMBIA, WAS HIT BY A WAVE OF THREATS THAT TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING
BUT FALSE ALARMS THAT NEVERTHELESS PROMPTED THE POLICE TO CONSTANTLY
PATROL THE CITY AND EVACUATE SHOPPING CENTERS IN SEARCH OF NONEXISTENT
BOMBS.

   WORKERS SAID THAT THE RESTAURANT, WHOSE OWNER WAS A FOLLOWER OF
RECENTLY ASSASSINATED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WAS
TORCHED BY RIFLE-TOTING YOUTHS.

   THEY LOCKED FOUR WORKERS IN AN OFFICE UNTIL THE FIRE STARTED.  THE
RESTAURANT SUFFERED 20 MILLION PESOS ($50,000) IN LOSES.

   HE ALSO SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ATTACK
ON 5 SEPTEMBER IN WHICH A MAN DRESSED IN COMBAT GEAR FIRED AN
AUTOMATIC RIFLE AT INDUSTRIALISTS AND BUSINESSMEN AT THE MEDELLIN
AIRPORT.

   THE SHARPSHOOTER, WHO WAS SHOT BY POLICEMEN, MANAGED TO KILL 1
PERSON AND WOUND 12 OTHERS.  THE ANONYMOUS CALLER GAVE NO EXPLANATION
FOR THE ATTACK, A CARACOL NEWSMAN TOLD REUTER.

   TWO WEEKS AGO THE EXTRADITABLES DECLARED "TOTAL WAR" AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO AFTER HE LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO
REPRESS THE DRUG BARONS IN WHICH 11,000 INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED AND
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTY OWNED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE
CONFISCATED.

   BOGOTA, 6 SEP 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE POLICE REPORTED TODAY THAT
U.S. JOURNALIST BERNARDETTE PARDO, WHO WAS SENT TO COLOMBIA BY THE
SPANISH-SPEAKING UNIVISION TELEVISION NETWORK TO COVER THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT'S "WAR" AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WAS INJURED LAST NIGHT
DURING AN ATTACK IN MEDELLILN.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT PARDO WAS IN A RESTAURANT IN MEDELLIN
ACCOMPANIED BY CAMERAMAN CARLOS CORRALES AND COLOMBIAN MOVIE ACTOR
JORGE SAENZ WHEN A MEDIUM-INTENSITY BOMB EXPLODED IN THE
ESTABLISHMENT.

   PARDO, OF CUBAN ORIGIN, SUFFERED FRACTURES IN HER CLAVICLE AND
RIGHT SHOULDER BLADE AND WOUNDS IN HER NECK.  SHE IS CURRENTLY AT A
HOSPITAL IN MEDELLIN.  CORRALES WAS INJURED BY SPLINTERS IN VARIOUS
PARTS OF HIS BODY.

   THE POLICE REPORTED THAT THE ATTACK WAS APPARENTLY CARRIED OUT BY A
COUPLE THAT WAS SITTING AT A TABLE CLOSE TO THE JOURNALISTS.
ACCORDING TO REPORTS, A WOMAN WENT TO THE RESTROOM, THEN LEFT IN A
HURRY FOLLOWED BY THE MAN, WHO WAS ACCOMPANYING HER, SHORTLY BEFORE
THE EXPLOSION.

   ON THE NIGHT OF 3 SEPTEMBER UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS PLACED TWO
BOMBS IN A PARKING LOT AND GARDEN OF A MEDELLIN HOTEL WHERE SEVERAL
FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WERE STAYING.  THE JOURNALISTS ARRIVED IN COLOMBIA
A FEW DAYS AGO TO COVER THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S
STRUGGLE AGAINST NARCOTICS-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS.

   ALTHOUGH NO ONE WAS INJURED IN THAT INCIDENT, IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL, THE LARGEST DRUG-TRAFFICKING RING IN THE WORLD, HAD
DECLARED AN ALL-OUT "WAR" AGAINST FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHO REMAIN
COLOMBIA.

   LIKEWISE, COLOMBIAN JOURNALISTS WERE THREATENED A FEW DAYS AFTER
THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE BEGAN, IN REPRISAL FOR THE HARD BLOWS DEALT
TO THE DRUG CARTEL, IN THE PAST 3 WEEKS.

   IN A STATEMENT FOR A FRENCH NEWSPAPER, PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL'S MAIN "CAPO" SAID THAT JOURNALISTS AND JUDGES "WILL
PAY THE CONSEQUENCES" OF THE GOVERNMENT'S STRUGGLE, WHICH HAS RESULTED
IN HUNDREDS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARRESTED AND NUMEROUS PROPERTIES OWNED
BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS CONFISCATED.

   THE ATTACK AGAINST THE UNIVISION JOURNALISTS OCCURRED
SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE POLICE IN ANTIOQUIA
DEPARTMENT -- THE CAPITAL OF WHICH IS MEDELLIN -- OF THE ARREST OF
FOUR DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHOSE EXTRADITION MAY HAVE BEEN REQUESTED BY THE
UNITED STATES.

   THE NAMES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE NOT DISCLOSED TO THE PRESS.
HOWEVER, IT WAS LEARNED THAT THEIR ARREST TOOK PLACE DURING INTENSIVE
OPERATIONS WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THIS CITY DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS AS
A RESULT OF WHICH 21 MERCENARIES OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAVE FALLEN.

   MEMBERS OF THE SAME NARCOTICS-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION DETONATED
TWO BOMBS IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SET A RESTAURANT ON FIRE IN
MEDELLIN, POLICE SPOKESMEN REPORTED.

COLOMBIA AND THE WORLD RECEIVED WITH OPTIMISM THE BUSH ANTIDRUG PLAN.
THE U.S. PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED CONTROLS AND PUNISHMENTS FOR THOSE WHO
USE DRUGS.  HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT $8 BILLION HAS BEEN ALLOTED FOR
THIS PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES REHABILITATION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS.  THE
MEASURES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED.  HOWEVER, THE BUSH PLAN BRINGS HOPE IN
THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG USAGE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSH] THIS IS A COCAINE BY-PRODUCT CALLED CRACK
WHICH WAS CONFISCATED A FEW DAYS AGO BY POLICEMEN AT A PARK IN FRONT

CANDY, BUT THIS IS TURNING OUR CITIES INTO BATTLEFIELDS AND IS KILLING
OUR CHILDREN. [END RECORDING]

   THIS IS HOW PRESIDENT BUSH BEGAN HIS SPEECH, IN WHICH HE DELIVERED
HIS PLAN TO U.S. CITIZENS ON FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE HUGE
NUMBER OF DRUG USERS MADE THE GOVERNMENT INCREASE THE $2 BILLION
BUDGET LAST YEAR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSH] AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS CHART, IN 1985 THE
GOVERNMENT ESTIMATED THAT 23 MILLION U.S. CITIZENS WERE USING DRUGS ON
A CASUAL BASIS; THAT IS, AT LEAST ONCE DURING THE PAST MONTH.  LAST
YEAR, THIS FIGURE DROPPED BY OVER 1/3, WHICH MEANS THAT 9 MILLION U.S.
CITIZENS HAVE CEASED BEING OCCASIONAL DRUG USERS.  ALTHOUGH THE
OVERALL COCAINE USAGE HAS DROPPED, THE FREQUENT USE OF COCAINE HAS
ALMOST DOUBLED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.  THESE ARE THE CASUAL COCAINE
USERS, THOSE WHO CONSUME CRACK, AND WHO REPRESENT THE MOST SERIOUS AND
URGENT PROBLEM. [END RECORDING]

   PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADVISERS SAID THE PRESIDENT IS AWARE OF THE
DIFFICULTIES OF THE PLAN, HOWEVER HE BELIEVES THIS IS THE FIRST STEP
IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS.

   THE BOGOTA NEWSPAPERS DEDICATED THEIR MAIN HEADLINES THIS MORNING
TO THE U.S.  PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.  IN GENERAL THEY COMPARED HIS SPEECH
TO A DECLARATION OF WAR: "BUSH WAGES WAR (EL ESPECTADOR), "BUSH
DECLARES WAR" (EL SIGLO), "8 BILLION AGAINST DRUGS" (EL TIEMPO).

   THE NEWSPAPERS DID NOT DEDICATE ANY EDITORIAL TO BUSH'S SPEECH, BUT
LIMITED THEMSELVES TO PUBLISHING EXCERPTS OF HIS SPEECH, TAKING
SPECIAL NOTE OF THE 5-YEAR $2 BILLION AID PLAN FOR COLOMBIA, PERU, AND
BOLIVIA.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, THE TROOPS ARRIVED AT A RURAL AREA
IN CENTRAL BOYACA PORT MUNICIPALITY AND RAIDED FIVE FARMS WHICH,
ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE, WERE USED BY THE MAFIA TO TRAIN
RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS.

   ACCORDING TO SECRET POLICE INVESTIGATIONS, THE PARAMILITARY SQUADS
WERE FORMED BY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL TO PROTECT ITS INTERESTS.  THE
MEMBERS OF THOSE SQUADS WERE TRAINED BY ISRAELI MERCENARIES HEADED BY
FORMER LT COL JAIR KLEIN.

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE COLOMBIAN OFFENSIVE
AGAINST THE NARCO-CRIMINAL GROUPS 3 WEEKS AGO, JOINT ARMY AND POLICE
TROOPS HAVE SEIZED 15 FARMS AND SEVERAL URBAN HOUSES OWNED BY GONZALEZ
GACHA.

CLOSELY WITH EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL FINANCE
CHIEF, IS NOT RULED OUT.  MARTINEZ ROMERO WAS EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED
STATES ON WEDNESDAY, 6 SEPTEMBER.

   REPORTS PUBLISHED BY THE BOGOTA MORNING NEWSPAPER EL TIEMPO

   NAMED THE SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE FOR DRUG CONTROL, IT WAS
HELD AUG 29-31 HERE, AND REPRESENTATIVES PRAISED COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES
FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE REPRISAL AGAINST DRUG LORDS AND THEIR MAFIAS.

   ARGENTINA, CHILE, COLOMBIA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA PERU, COSTA
RICA, BRAZIL AND OTHERS ALL EXPRESSED THE SAME APPREHENSION, INVASION
BY DISPLACED COLOMBIAN DRUG DEALERS.

   THE UNITED STATES, ATTENDING UNOFFICIALLY, REPORTEDLY DID NOT SAY

SOPHISTICATED MILITARY HARDWARE DELIVERED FRIDAY TO COLOMBIA BY TWO
ENORMOUS C-130'S.  HERE, MAFIA WARLORDS OPENLY THREATENED TO CARRY OUT
THEIR TERRORIST BOMBINGS AND KILLINGS "IN BROAD DAYLIGHT TO SHOW WE
CANNOT BE STOPPED."

   MEXICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ENRIQUE ALVAREZ DEL CASTILLO CONGRATULATED
THOSE IN ATTENDANCE AND OFFERED THE EXPERIENCE MEXICO HAD ACQUIRED
DURING 10 YEARS OF AN AGGRESSIVE DRUG WAR.

   BESIDES MORAL SUPPORT, MEXICO UNDERLINED THE NEED FOR COORDINATED
EFFORTS IN LAWS AND ACTION.  FIRST, THAT COURTS HAND DOWN STIFF
SENTENCES; SECOND, THAT NO BAIL BE GRANTED IN DRUG TRIALS; THIRD, THAT
ALL PROPERTY DERIVED FROM DRUG PROFITS BE CONFISCATED AND LEGALLY USED
TO DEFRAY COSTS OF COMBATTING DRUG TRAFFIC.

   IN THE FINAL RESOLUTION, THE NINE NATIONS ACCEPTED TO EXCHANGE
INFORMATION, COORDINATE ALL ACTIVITIES JOINTLY - BUT CARRY THEM OUT
SEPARATELY BECAUSE OF THE DELICATE ISSUE OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY -
COMPLETE COOPERATION IN ALL AREAS AND TO REGARD THE DRUG EFFORT AS AN
INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM WHERE PRODUCER, DEALER AND USER MUST ALL BE
COMBATTED.

   ON FRIDAY, BRAZIL AND COLOMBIA AGREED TO JOINTLY PROTECTING THEIR
BORDERS TO KEEP DRUG DEALERS OUT AND AWAY FROM THOSE THAT HAVE BECOME
A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN BRAZIL.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 12 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE HUMAN RIGHTS
COMMISSION OF GUATEMALA [CDH] CHARGED HERE TODAY THE "SHARED
RESPONSIBILITY" OF PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AND THE SECRET SERVICE OF
THE ARMY (G-2) IN THE DEATH OF FOUR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, WHOSE
BRUTALLY MUTILATED BODIES WERE FOUND ON 10 SEPTEMBER IN A GUATEMALA
CITY SUBURB.

   THE FINDING COMES IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS, KILLINGS,
AND DYNAMITE ATTACKS WHICH WERE UNLEASHED STARTING IN MID-JULY AND
WHICH HAS SHOCKED THE GUATEMALANS.  THE WHEREABOUTS OF SEVEN OTHER
STUDENTS, KIDNAPPED BY ALLEGED DEATH SQUADS, REMAIN UNKNOWN.  THESE
SQUADS HAVE BEEN ON THE RAMPAGE SINCE 23 AUGUST.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE TO VARIOUS POLITICAL, TRADE UNION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS
ORGANIZATIONS, THE CHDG BRANCH IN SAN JOSE REQUESTED "URGENTLY" THE
SENDING OF MESSAGES TO THE GUATEMALAN EMBASSIES, GOVERNMENT, AND ARMY
CONDEMNING THE "IMPUNITY" OF THE DEATH SQUADS.

   TWO OF THE MURDERED VICTIMS -- SILVIA AZURDIA AND HER HUSBAND
VICTOR HUGO RODRIGUEZ -- WERE ABDUCTED BY EIGHT MEN IN CIVILIAN
CLOTHES BEFORE WITNESSES WHO EVEN PROVIDED THE AUTHORITIES WITH THE
LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS OF THE TWO VEHICLES USED BY THE KIDNAPPERS.

   THE CDHG EXPRESSED "DEEP CONCERN OVER THESE EVENTS WHICH REFLECT A
TOTAL LACK OF POLITICAL WILLINGNESS" ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TO
END REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE.

   ACCORDING TO HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, GUATEMALA HOLDS A RECORD
IN THE HEMISPHERE, 40,000 MISSING PERSONS IN THE LAST 20 YEARS.

   ON 11 SEPTEMBER, IT WAS OFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT THE MUTILATED AND
BULLET-RIDDLED BODIES OF THREE MORE UNIDENTIFIED GUATEMALANS WERE
FOUND.

   ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS KILLED LAST WEEKEND WAS CARLOS
HUMBERTO CABRERA, WHO HAD RETURNED TO GUATEMALA AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF
EXILE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GUARANTEES ANNOUNCED BY THE CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT TO REPATRIATE HOME ANY GUATEMALAN WHO WISHED TO
COME, THE LOCAL PRESS REPORTED TODAY.

   ON THE OTHER HAND, HUMBERTO CHUTA, A BROTHER OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS,
STATED THAT "IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO LIVE ALL OUR LIVES AS IF WE
WERE DOGS."  HE REQUESTED CEREZO "DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO
INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION, IF HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT
HAPPENED."

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] SINCE A MINE
IS A WEAPON OF A MILITARY NATURE AND SINCE ITS USE HAS INCREASED IN
THE PAST FEW YEARS THROUGHOUT VARIOUS UNPOPULATED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY
WHERE MINE FIELDS HAVE BEEN PLANTED, THE SWEEPING OF THIS TYPE OF
WEAPON WILL NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE DONE GRADUALLY FOR TECHNICAL AND
OPERATIONAL REASONS.  THEREFORE, THE MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED TO SUSPEND
THEIR USE WILL BE:

   1.  END THE MANUFACTURING OF BOOBY TRAPS.

   2.  END TO THE PLANTING OF NEW MINE FIELDS.

   3.  IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF ALL MINES PLANTED IN AREAS OF HIGH RISK
FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND MARKING OF THOSE AREAS THAT, FOR
TECHNICAL REASONS -- LOSS OF MAP OF THE MINED AREAS -- CANNOT BE SWEPT
IMMEDIATELY.

   4.  GRADUAL SWEEPING OF THE MINE FIELDS LOCATED IN AREAS OF LOW
RISK FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND MARKING OF SITES WHERE, FOR
TECHNICAL REASONS, THE MINES CANNOT BE REMOVED.

   5.  THIS ORDER DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CLAYMORE MINES USED IN THE
AMBUSH OF SOLDIERS.

   WE WILL COORDINATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE MEASURES WITH
HUMANITARIAN AID ORGANIZATIONS AND THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES.

   LIKEWISE, WE EXPECT THE ARMY TO SWEEP THE MINE FIELDS THAT SURROUND
THE GARRISONS AND FIXED MILITARY POSTS LOCATED IN HEAVILY POPULATED
AREAS.  THESE MINES ARE CONSTANTLY HARMING THE PEOPLE OR THEIR
DOMESTIC ANIMALS.

   LIKEWISE, THE ARMY MUST CEASE ALL BOMBING AND SHELLING OF CIVILIAN

SHAFIK HANDAL IN THE MEXICAN CAPITAL TODAY SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS HAVE PROPOSED NINE POINTS "THAT REFLECT THE ASPIRATIONS OF
THE ENTIRE NATION" TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT.

   HANDAL POINTED OUT THAT THEY WILL BE STUDIED TODAY AND TOMORROW
DURING MEETINGS HERE BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AND A SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION.

   THE NINE POINTS REVEALED BY THE GUERRILLA COMMANDER ARE:

   1. BEGINNING OF A PROCESS TO INTRODUCE AMENDMENTS TO THE JUDICIAL
SYSTEM AGREED UPON BY CONSENSUS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION
PARTIES.

   2. JOINT ACCORD ON MEASURES TO ENSURE THE END OF ALL FORMS OF
REPRESSION AND FULL RESPECT FOR DEMOCRATIC LIBERTIES THAT WOULD BE
VERIFIED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND OAS.

   3. PACT TO CONTINUE HONEST JUDICIAL PROCESS GUARANTEEING THE
DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PUNISHMENT OF THOSE WHO ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF MONSIGNOR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO
AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN DEATH SQUADS.

   4. ACCORD TO DISSOLVE THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE THAT CAUSES POLITICAL
AND SOCIAL CONFRONTATION THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE OF REFORMS PROMOTED
BY THE GOVERNMENT OF JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WHO PRECEDED CRISTIANI.

   5. PACT ON MEASURES FOR SELF-MONITORING AND PROFESSIONALIZATION OF
THE ARMED FORCES.

   6. COMMITMENT FROM THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT THAT IT WILL
SUBMIT ACCORDS ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT COULD EMERGE FROM
THIS DIALOGUE THAT BEGINS TODAY FOR APPROVAL BY THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY.

   7. ACCORD TO ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS TO BRING
ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND ACCELERATE AN
END TO THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR.

   8. MUTUAL GUARANTEES FOR THE OPERATION AND SETTLEMENT OF FORCES
THAT WILL GUARANTEE RESPECT FOR A CEASE-FIRE WITHOUT THIS IMPLYING A
VIOLATION OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

   9. INITIAL STEPS FOR THE INCORPORATION OF THE FMLN INTO SALVADORAN
POLITICAL LIFE.

   AS FOR THIS LATTER POINT, HANDAL SAID THAT THE FMLN MUST BECOME A
POLITICAL PARTY BY REGISTERING ITS FOLLOWERS AND ESTABLISHING A
RAPPORT WITH THE MEDIA.

   HE POINTED OUT THAT THIS GUERRILLA GROUP HAS ESTABLISHED A "NO
LATER THAN 15 NOVEMBER" DEADLINE TO ACHIEVE A CEASE-FIRE ACCORD.

OPTIMISM, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS OPENED A
DIALOGUE IN MEXICO CITY TODAY TO ESTABLISH PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WITH
A SPECTACULAR PRIOR ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE INSURGENTS THAT THEY ARE
PREPARED TO DECLARE A DEFINITIVE CEASE-FIRE AND BECOME A POLITICAL
PARTY.

   THIS PROPOSAL -- WHICH ENTAILS A DECISION TO LAY DOWN ARMS IF
CERTAIN PRIOR CONDITIONS ARE MET -- DID NOT MEET WITH A MATCHING
PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THE DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING PLACE IN A
MODERN BUILDING BELONGING TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION IN A
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IN THE SOUTHERN SECTION OF MEXICO CITY.

   COMMANDER MIGUEL SAENZ OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) SAID DURING A RECESS THAT "THE GOVERNMENT'S COMMISSION
DID NOT BRING ANY SUBSTANTIVE PROPOSAL."

   ALL THE MEN WERE WEARING COATS AND TIE, WHEREAS THE FEMALE FMLN
COMMANDERS WERE IN VERY FORMAL ATTIRE.

   THE MEETING IS TAKING PLACE IN A 10-SQUARE-METER ROOM IN WHICH THE
GOVERNMENT DELEGATES AND GUERRILLAS SIT FACE-TO-FACE, WITH THE
MODERATORS AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE.  THE ROOM HAS AN ANNEX TO WHICH
THE NEGOTIATORS WITHDRAW DURING RECESSES TO ANALYZE THE OTHER SIDE'S
POSITIONS.

   MSGR ROMEO TOBAR ASTORGA, WHO IS THE MODERATOR OF THE MEETING AND
PRESIDENT OF THE SALVADORAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, HAD ASSERTED BEFORE
THE START OF THE MEETING THAT HE COULD SEE A WILLINGNESS ON BOTH SIDES
"TO END A WAR THAT HAS CAUSED MANY VICTIMS."

   "ALTHOUGH I AM NOT A MARXIST, BECAUSE THAT IDEOLOGY IS ATHEISTIC
AND MATERIALISTIC, I AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS URGENT THAT THIS DIALOGUE
LEAD TO THE PEACE WE LONG FOR," HE ALSO SAID.

   SAENZ, WHO ALSO SOUNDED OPTIMISTIC BUT CAUTIOUS, SAID DURING A
BRIEF TALK WITH NEWSMEN THAT PROCEDURES FOR THIS AND SUBSEQUENT
MEETINGS ARE UNDER DISCUSSION, AND TIMETABLES, STAGES, AND SITES
SHOULD RESULT FROM THEM.

   SHORTLY BEFORE THE MEETING BEGAN, OSCAR SANTAMARIA, WHO IS THE
JUSTICE MINISTER AND ONE OF THE OFFICIAL DELEGATES, ASSERTED THAT
"THERE IS UTMOST WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE" ON THE PART OF THE
GOVERNMENT.

   IN ADDITION TO SANTAMARIA, THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION ARE PRESIDENCY MINISTER JUAN MARTINEZ, POET DAVID ESCOBAR,
AND ADVISERS HECTOR CONTRERAS AND ABELARDO TORRES.  TOBAR ASTORGA IS
ACCOMPANIED BY MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   BESIDES SAENZ, THE FMLN IS REPRESENTED BY COMMANDERS SHAFIK HANDAL,
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, ANA GUADALUPE MARTINEZ, MERCEDES LETONA, MARIO
ROJAS, AND DANIEL LOPEZ.

   AT 1045 (1645 GMT), 1 HOUR BEFORE THE MEETING BEGAN, THE FMLN
RELEASED ITS PROPOSAL TO THE PRESS, WHICH INCLUDES A CEASE-FIRE ON 15
NOVEMBER, A DEFINITIVE END TO THE HOSTILITIES ON 31 JANUARY, AND THE
INCORPORATION OF ITS LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS INTO THE COUNTRY'S
POLITICAL LIFE THROUGH A POLITICAL PARTY.

   THE CONDITIONS DEMANDED BY THE FMLN INCLUDE REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL
SYSTEMS, AN END TO ALL MANNER OF REPRESSION, THE PURGING
 AND PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, THE FULL EXERCISE OF
FREEDOMS (VERIFIED BY THE UN AND THE OAS), THE REORGANIZATION OF THE
ELECTORAL SYSTEM, THE HOLDING OF THE 1991 LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL
ELECTIONS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, AND AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE
ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.

   THE FIRST STEP THE FMLN WOULD TAKE ONCE THE CEASE-FIRE IS IN PLACE
WOULD BE TO LEGALIZE THE STATUS OF ITS MILITANTS AND ITS MEDIA. "THIS
STEP INVOLVES RISKS, BUT WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE THEM," THE GUERRILLA
DELEGATES SAID.

   THE TALKS WERE CONTINUING EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON WITHOUT ACCESS TO
THE PRESS AND AMID A DISCREET SECURITY MEASURE ESTABLISHED BY THE
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT -- JUST A COUPLE OF MEN WITH "WALKIE-TALKIES" AND
DISGUISED WEAPONS.

   SAVE FOR AN UNFORESEEN OBSTACLE, THE MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO
CONTINUE TOMORROW, THURSDAY.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 12 SEP 89 (LA REPUBLICA) -- [EDITORIAL] [LUIS
RESTREPO] [TEXT] NICARAGUA WILL HOLD GENERAL ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR IN
FEBRUARY.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, HAS
BEEN BRAZENLY MANEUVERING SO THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE TO
THE EMPIRE'S INTERESTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  BESIDES ITS INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES, THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS MAINTAINED A TEAM DEDICATED TO
ELECTORAL TERRORISM TO SERVE THE OPPOSITION SECTORS IN HANDLING
CAMPAIGN PROPAGANDA, DISTRIBUTING MONEY, AND FALSIFYING AND STEALING
TALLY SHEETS.  THESE TERRORIST AGENTS BELIEVE THAT THEIR EXPERIENCE IN
PANAMA, WHERE THEY CLAIM THEY WERE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, CAN BE APPLIED
TO NICARAGUA.

   AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD PROCLAIMING U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE
FEBRUARY ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, PRESIDENT BUSH IS "CONSIDERING"
MAKING AN INITIAL DONATION OF $3 MILLION TO THE OPPOSITION.  THE STATE
DEPARTMENT HAS ALLEGEDLY SAID THAT "PRESIDENT BUSH HAS BEEN
CONSIDERING RESORTING TO THE CIA TO CONTROL THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS
AND TO DISTRIBUTE MONEY TO OPPOSITION PARTY LEADERS."

   ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCE, PRESIDENT BUSH IS NOT DISCARDING THE
USE OF THE SO-CALLED "CONTRAS" TO HARASS THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT
FROM HONDURAS TO CREATE CHAOS DURING THE ELECTIONS, GIVING THE UNITED
STATES AN EXCUSE TO OCCUPY NICARAGUA MILITARILY."

   ACCORDING TO CONTINENTAL OBSERVERS, PRESIDENT BUSH HAS DECIDED
"THAT THE NICARGUAN ELECTIONS MUST BE WON BY THE UNITED STATES."

   VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO'S CANDIDACY IS A SIMPLE COVER-UP, THE SAME AS
THE CANDIDACY LAUNCHED BY THE SECTORS THAT OPPOSE OUR COUNTRY'S
CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT.

   ANY ANALYST CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT "THE UNITED STATES IS NOT GOING TO
TAKE ITS HANDS OFF CENTRAL AMERICA."  THAT IS WHY WASHINGTON IS
SEEKING FORMULAS TO SEND MONEY TO THE OPPOSITION, NOT ONLY LEGALLY,
BUT ALSO THROUGH ILLEGAL CHANNELS AND PHANTOM ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH,
UNDER THE EXCUSE OF "DEFENDING DEMOCRACY" OPERATE IN AFGHANISTAN,
ANGOLA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST; SUPPORT APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA; AND
ENGAGE IN OTHER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

   PRESIDENT BUSH HAS SAID THAT "THE FEBRUARY ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA
ARE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT AN END TO THE MARXIST GOVERNMENT IN
NICARAGUA HEADED BY DANIEL ORTEGA."  ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS, "THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT IS READY TO SPEND AT LEAST $200 MILLION TO WIN THE
ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA."  IT IS ALSO READY TO EXPAND SANCTIONS AGAINST
THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, THEREBY INCREASING DESPERATION, BECAUSE IT
BELIEVES THAT THE PEOPLE'S DESPERATION, MISERY, HUNGER, AND DEATHS
MIGHT PRODUCE A REBELLION FAVORABLE TO U.S. INTERESTS."

ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE DISCOVERED THAT
MEMBERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL PROVIDE ALTERED GUATEMALAN PASSPORTS TO
COURIERS WHO BRING TO GUATEMALA COCAINE THAT IS LATER TAKEN TO THE
UNITED STATES.

   ARTURO CHUR DEL CID, DIRECTOR OF THE GUATEMALAN IMMIGRATION
DEPARTMENT, HAS REPORTED THAT IN BOGOTA, DURING A RECENT MILITARY
OPERATION AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, THE POLICE SEIZED THREE GUATEMALAN
PASSPORTS.

   THE SEIZED DOCUMENTS WERE ISSUED TO GERMAN ALBERTO MARIN RAMOS,
CESAR AUGUSTO SALDANA, AND IRMA YOLANDA SAMAYOA VELIZ.

   CHUR DEL CID SAID: "THE PASSPORTS WERE ISSUED BY GUATEMALA'S
IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT.  THEY COULD HAVE BEEN STOLEN AND TAKEN TO
COLOMBIA WHERE THEY WERE FOUND WITH DIFFERENT PHOTOGRAPHS, READY FOR
USE BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS."

   THE OFFICIAL SAID THAT THE DOCUMENTS WERE CAREFULLY ANALYZED AND
THAT IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT DATA ON THE PASSPORTS WAS ALTERED
AND THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE NOT THOSE OF THE TRUE OWNERS OF THE
DOCUMENTS.

   AS A RESULT OF THIS SITUATION, ANYONE WITH A COLOMBIAN VISA WANTING
TO COME TO GUATEMALA MUST FIRST CONSULT WITH AUTHORITIES TO SEE IF
THIS IS POSSIBLE.  THIS IS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE TO KEEP THE COUNTRY
FROM SERVING AS A SPRINGBOARD OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

BUT HAVE NOT BROKEN OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS, AN M-19 SPOKESMAN ANNOUNCED
TODAY.

   RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR PEACE AFFAIRS,
ANNOUNCED THAT AFTER THE TALKS ON 13 SEPTEMBER IN SANTO DOMINGO (400
KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA), THE AGREEMENT FOR THE M-19 TO DEMOBILIZE AND
RETURN TO POLITICAL LIFE WAS POSTPONED.

   IN STATEMENTS BY TELEPHONE TO REUTER FROM SANTO DOMINGO, HIPOLITO
BLANCO, A RANKING M-19 SPOKESMAN, SAID "WE HOPE TO HOLD ANOTHER
MEETING SOON; THE TOPICS WE MUST AGREE UPON ARE COMPLEX AND WE MUST
TAKE TIME TO ANALYZE THEM."

   BLANCO POINTED OUT THAT "YESTERDAY'S MEETING WAS CHARACTERIZED BY
CORDIALITY," BUT "THE MECHANISMS TO BROADEN DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY
AND DEMOBILIZATION" ARE ISSUES THAT MUST STILL BE STUDIED IN-DEPTH.

   BLANCO ADMITTED THAT ONE OF THE SUBJECTS BEING CONSIDERED IS A
PARDON FOR M-19 MEMBERS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE
VIOLENT OCCUPATION OF THE JUSTICE PALACE IN NOVEMBER 1985, WHEN
APPROXIMATELY 100 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

   THE M-19 IS ONE OF SIX ACTIVE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN COLOMBIA AND THE
ONE THAT HAS MADE THE GREATEST PROGRESS IN PEACE TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT.

   THE GROUP IS NATIONALIST IN IDEOLOGY.  IT HAS 1,000 ARMED MEN, IS
BEST KNOWN FOR ITS SPECTACULAR OPERATIONS, AND MAY WELL BECOME THE
FIRST COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUP TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS INDEFINITELY.

   THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 SIGNED A PEACE AGREEMENT ON 17 MARCH
AND OPENED TALKS IN MAY WITH POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS CALLED
"WORKING TABLES."

   THE INITIAL RESULTS OF THE "WORKING TABLES" -- WHICH ENDED THE
FIRST WEEK OF JULY -- WILL BE PRESENTED TO CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENCY
IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS, LAWS,
OR DECREES.

   SOME OF THE REFORMS DEAL WITH THE REPRESENTATION OF MINORITY GROUPS
IN CONGRESS AND MECHANISMS FOR THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE GUERRILLAS.

   OTHER GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS WILL PROBABLY MEET WITH THE
GOVERNMENT THIS MONTH TO SPEED UP THE PEACEMAKING PROCESS.

   THE ONLY GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS STAYED AWAY FROM THE PEACE
PROCESS IS THE CASTROITE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY, WHICH CEASED
BOMBING PIPELINES ON 25 AUGUST, BUT HAS CONTINUED ITS GUERRILLA
OPERATIONS.

   ACCORDING TO MILITARY ESTIMATES, THE SIX INSURGENT GROUPS IN
COLOMBIA HAVE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 7,000 ARMED MEN.

CHARGES AGAINST THEM IN THAT COUNTRY.

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT PELAEZ ROLDAN WAS ARRESTED IN BOGOTA AND IS
CHARGED BY A COURT IN DETROIT OF CONSPIRACY TO DISTRIBUTE COCAINE IN
THE UNITED STATES.

   BUENO DELGADO WAS ARRESTED BY THE POLICE ON SAN ANDRES ISLAND IN
THE CARIBBEAN AND WAS IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED TO BOGOTA AND HANDED
OVER TO JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES.

   ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, DAS, SPOKESMEN SAID THAT
REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OF THE SUSPECTED DRUG LORD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED
FROM FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA COURTS, WHERE HE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH
SMUGGLING AT LEAST 5,000 KG OF COCAINE INTO THE UNITED STATES AND
LAUNDERING DOLLARS OBTAINED AS A RESULT OF THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

   LAST WEEK, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT EXTRADITED THE ALLEDGED
"FINANCIAL HEAD" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL TO THE UNITED STATES.  HE IS
EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO AND HAS TO ANSWER CHARGES IN AN ATLANTA COURT
OF "LAUNDERING" MORE THAN $1.2 BILLION THROUGH A PANAMANIAN BANK.

   THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS HAVE THREATENED TO MURDER 10 JUDGES FOR
EACH COLOMBIAN EXTRADITED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY, AND THIS THREAT HAS THE
WHOLE COUNTRY TENSE AND ANXIOUS.

   THERE ARE RUMORS CIRCULATING IN SEVERAL CITIES THAT NARCOCRIMINAL
ORGANIZATIONS ARE PREPARING AN OPERATION CALLED "BLACK SEPTEMBER" THAT
WILL BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT WEEKEND BY POISONING WATER SUPPLIES AND
ATTACKING COMMERCIAL CENTERS AND NIGHT CLUBS.

BROKEN THE UNILATERAL TRUCE.  THE ARCE BATTALION CHIEFS SAID THAT
CLASHES TOOK PLACE IN THE AREA OF PERQUIN AND ADMITTED THAT TWO

   IN REGARD TO THOSE STATEMENTS, WE CONSIDER THAT:

   1. FOR 7 YEARS AND AFTER HAVING BEEN EXPELLED FROM THAT AREA, THE
GOVERNMENT FORCES DO NOT HAVE FIXED POSITIONS NORTH OF MORAZAN
DEPARTMENT.  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR TRUCE, ARCE BATTALION TROOPS
HAVE BEGUN TO ENTER OUR TERRITORIES.  THUS, THE CASUALTIES SUSTAINED
BY THE ARCE BATTALION ARE A RESULT OF ACTIONS IN WHICH THE FMLN ACTED
IN DEFENSE OF ITS FORCES.

   2. ALL ENEMY UNITS THAT CROSS THE TOROLA RIVER DURING AN OPERATION
[WORD INDISTINCT] BECOME A MILITARY TARGET AND MORE SO IN THIS CASE,
BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES BOMBED AND STRAFFED PERQUIN CIVILIANS, AMONG
WHOM THERE HAVE BEEN CASUALTIES.

   3. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION OF MAINTAINING THE TRUCE DURING THE
ESTABLISHED DAYS JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING, ALTHOUGH UP UNTIL NOW THE
REGIME HAS FAILED TO EXPRESS ANY GOODWILL; HAS REFUSED TO ALLOW THE
EVACUATION OF THE WAR DISABLED; AND HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF

[FLMN] OF EL SALVADOR A LEGAL PARTY, FAR FROM WEAKENING THE GUERRILLA,

IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A DRASTIC INTERNAL CHANGE, THE PROPOSAL MADE BY
THE GUERRILLA IS A POLITICAL BLOW TO THE SALVADORAN EXTREME RIGHT.

   PRENSA LATINA ADDS THAT THE DISARMAMENT AND PEACE OFFER GIVES

IN THE INTERNATIONAL AREA. NO MATTER WHAT THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE IS
DURING THE CONSULTATION SESSIONS BEING HELD IN MEXICO BETWEEN THE
EXTREME RIGHT'S NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE AND REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE FLMN, THE SALVADORAN REACTIONARIES WILL NOT BENEFIT. THE FLMN SAID
IN THE MEETING IN MEXICO THAT EITHER THE REGIME ACCEPTS THE CONDITIONS
SUGGESTED BY THE GUERRILLA OR PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCES HE
FAVORS A WAR HE CANNOT WIN.

   THE GUERRILLA PROPOSES THE TOTAL CEASE OF HOSTILITIES BEFORE 31
JANUARY, END OF THE REPRESSION, SELF-CLEANING OF THE ARMY, AND THE
RESTRUCTURING OF THE MUNICIPAL AND ELECTORAL SYSTEM, AMONG OTHER
PROPOSALS.  PRENSA LATINA COMMENTS THAT THE SWIFTNESS WITH WHICH THE
GUERRILLA CHIEFS PRESENTED THEIR PROPOSALS AND THEIR CONTENTS LEFT
CRISTIANI'S CABINET AT THE DEFENSIVE AS WELL AS ITS MANEUVERS TO
DISARM THE REVOLUTIONARIES.  THE AGREEMENT OF ARENA, THE ULTRA-RIGHT
RULING PARTY, TO TALK WITH THE GUERRILLA OPENS A POSSIBILITY FOR PEACE

   BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PRO-CASTROITE ARMY OF
NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) OF COLOMBIA DESTROYED A SECTION OF THE TECA
- VASCONIA OIL PIPELINE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY LAST NIGHT,
THE COLOMBIAN OIL ENTERPRISE (ECOPETROL) OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED TODAY.

   THE NEW TERRORIST ACTION WAS STAGED IN PUERTO BOYACA WHERE THE OIL
PIPELINE WAS DESTROYED AND MUCH ELN PROPAGANDA WAS STREWN.

   ECOPETROL STATED THAT THE ATTACK OCCURRED "DESPITE THE SUBVERSIVE
GROUP'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT WILL SUSPEND THIS TYPE OF ACTION TO
FACILITATE THE PUBLIC DEBATE OF OIL POLICY."

   THIS OIL PIPELINE CONNECTS VASCONIA IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE
COUNTRY WITH THE LINE THAT GOES TO BARRANCABERMEJA IN CENTRAL COLOMBIA
WHERE ECOPETROL HAS ITS MAIN REFINERY.

   THE ELN, A GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS BEEN WAGING AN ARMED STRUGGLE
FOR 25 YEARS AND IS LED BY FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, CLAIMS
THAT THE SABOTAGE AGAINST THE HYDROCARBONS AND MINING INDUSTRIES IS A
WAY OF PREVENTING INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES FROM SACKING THE COUNTRY'S
NATURAL RESOURCES.

   SINCE JANUARY 1988 WHEN IT BEGAN ITS ATTACKS ON OIL PIPELINES, THE
ELN HAS CARRIED OUT MORE THAN 130 ATTACKS AGAINST THE TECA - VASCONIA
PIPELINE, THE PACIFIC PIPELINE, AND THE COUNTRY'S MAIN OIL ARTERY, THE
CANO LIMON - COVENAS PIPELINE.

   BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [REPORT]
[HERNANDO CORRAL] [TEXT] THE THIRD PUBLIC JUDGE ISSUED ARREST WARRANTS
FOR NORBERTO HERNANDEZ ROMERO AND RAFAEL RIVERA ALARCON AND CHARGED
THEM WITH PARTICIPATING IN THE MURDER OF LIBERAL PARTY LEADER LUIS
CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO.  THE SAME JUDGE ISSUED AN ARREST WARRANT FOR
JAIME DE JESUS VALENCIA MARTINEZ AND CHARGED HIM WITH BEING THE
MASTERMIND OF THE CRIME.  THESE THREE PERSONS HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED
AND ARE BEING SOUGHT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   LUIS ALFREDO GONZALEZ CHACON, PEDRO ZAMBRANO DELGADO, NORBERTO
MURRILLO CHALARCA, ARMANDO BERNAL ACOSTA, HECTOR MANUEL ZEPEDA
QUINTERO, AND ALBERTO JUBIS HASZVUMB WERE ARRESTED A FEW DAYS AGO IN
BOGOTA AND CHARGED WITH BEING ACCOMPLICES TO THE CRIME.  THE THIRD
CIVIL JUDGE ALSO DECIDED TO RELEASE LUIS FELIPE TORRES, THE MAN WHO
CARRIED A POSTER AND A HAT AT THE MURDER SCENE AND WHO WAS INITIALLY
ACCUSED OF HAVING PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME.

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT JAIME DE JESUS VALENCIA MARTINEZ, THE
ALLEGED MASTERMIND OF THE CRIME, OFFERED 50 MILLION PESOS TO POLICE
OFFICIALS IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF SIX PERSONS WHO HAD
BEEN ARRESTED IN A LUXURY APARTMENT IN BOGOTA.  VALENCIA IS ALSO
CHARGED WITH BEING THE OWNER OF THE MACHINEGUN THAT WAS FOUND IN THE
APARTMENT IN WHICH THE SIX SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED.

   THE DEFENSE CLAIMS THAT THERE IS A SWORN STATEMENT BY FORMER
MINISTER CARLOS OBANDO VELASCO THAT CERTIFIES THAT HE WAS WITH JUBIS
HAZVUMB ON THE DAY GALAN WAS KILLED.  THE LAWYERS ALSO CLAIM THAT
GALAN SARMIENTO WAS KILLED BY AN UZI SUBMACHINEGUN AND THAT THE ONE
FOUND AT THE APARTMENT WHERE THE SIX SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED WAS AN
INGRAM.  BALLISTIC TEST RESULTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN REVEALED.  THE
DEFENSE LAWYERS HAVE APPEALED THE COURT DECISION, AND NOW THE COURT
WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF THE DECISION ISSUED BY THE THIRD PUBLIC JUDGE
IS TO STAND.

   BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE FRG EMBASSY IN BOGOTA TODAY
REJECTED A REPORT THAT SOME OF ITS OFFICIALS ARE LINKED TO THE
POWERFUL DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS THAT OPERATE IN COLOMBIA.

   THE REPORT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE GERMAN WEEKLY "WELT AM SONNTAG,"
WHICH BASED ITS INFORMATION ON FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE SOURCES
WHO STATED THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN THE DIPLOMATIC MISSION ASSIGNED TO
BOGOTA ARE LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING AND HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE
OPERATIONS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, THE BIGGEST DRUG TRAFFICKING
ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD.

   AN FRG EMBASSY SPOKESMAN WHO WAS QUESTIONED BY DPA SAID: "WE KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT A MISSION MEMBER WHO HAS BEEN LINKED TO DRUG
TRAFFICKING."

   ACCORDING TO THE GERMAN PUBLICATION, APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION
OBTAINED BY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL FOR THEIR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN
TRANSFERRED FROM BANKS IN COLOMBIA TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN PANAMA
AND LUXEMBOURG.

   LAST WEEK, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS DECLARED "WAR" ON
THE COCAINE GANGS, EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES EDUARDO MARTINEZ
ROMERO, THE ALLEGED "FINANCIAL HEAD" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.  ROMERO
IS ACCUSED OF BEING THE "BRAIN" BEHIND THE CARTEL'S MONEY-LAUNDERING
OPERATIONS.

   AT PRESENT, MARTINEZ ROMERO IS BEING CHARGED AT AN ATLANTA COURT
FOR ALLEGEDLY LAUNDERING MORE THAN $1.2 BILLION IN THE BANCO DE
OCCIDENTE DE PANAMA.  ACCORDING TO "WELT AM SONNTAG," THIS BANK SENT
THE DRUG TRAFFICKING FUNDS TO THE DEUTSCH-SUEDAMERIKANISCHE BANK.

   THE DRUG TRAFFICKER'S EXTRADITION HAS CAUSED TENSION AND ANXIETY IN
COLOMBIA BECAUSE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE WHEREIN THEY
THREATENED TO KILL 10 JUDGES FOR EACH COLOMBIAN SENT TO ANOTHER
COUNTRY.

   THE FRG EMBASSY SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT THE ALLEGED LINKS OF EMBASSY
OFFICIALS WITH THE MAFIA "WERE INVENTED BY A NEWS AGENCY -- NOT DPA --
THAT WROTE THE INFORMATION IN BONN."  THE INFORMATION WAS LATER
PUBLISHED BY "WELT AM SONNTAG," WHICH, THE SPOKESMAN SAID, WAS A
NEWSPAPER "THAT WAS NOT VERY IMPORTANT."

   SO FAR, THE "WAR" BEING CARRIED OUT BY COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS HAS LED
TO THE CAPTURE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO ARE CONNECTED TO THE DRUG CARTEL
AND THE CONFISCATION OF NUMEROUS PROPERTIES BELONGING TO THE "CAPOS"
PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE BIGGEST
MAFIOSOS IN THE WORLD, ACCORDING TO WASHINGTON AND BOGOTA.

   GUATEMALA CITY, NO DATE (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] THE SETTING OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AND THE KIDNAPPINGS ARE
AN ATTEMPT BY SOME TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT JUSTIFICATION FOR USING A
STRONG HAND, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID.  THE PRESIDENT STRESSED THAT THE
BOMBS AND THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] OF CANDIDATES IS THE WORK OF
TERRORISTS.  REPORTING THAT THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE
PRESENTED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, CEREZO AREVALO URGED CITIZENS TO HELP
IN THE EFFORTS TO CONTROL VIOLENCE.

   [CEREZO] "FIRST, WE NEED THE PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO HELP, WHICH
IMPLIES HAVING THE COURAGE TO PASS ON INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT,
BECAUSE PEOPLE FEAR REPRISALS FROM CRIMINALS.  HOWEVER, IF WE ARE NOT
ALL UNITED TO FIGHT CRIME AND TERRORISM, WE GUATEMALANS WILL CERTAINLY
BE AFFECTED SERIOUSLY IN THE FUTURE BY THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE, WHICH
SEEMS TO BE SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE
PAST.

   "SECOND, I HAVE NOTICED THAT SOME SECTORS HAVE TURNED TO THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BY REQUESTING THAT HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP
REPRESENTATIVES BE SENT HERE, AS IF THE GOVERNMENT [WORDS INDISTINCT].
PEOPLE ARE AWARE THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE, YET THEY HOLD THE
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE.  I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS TURN TO
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO THIS -- SO THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN HELP US CONTROL TERRORISM.

   "THIRD, I MUST RECOGNIZE THAT ONE OF THE PARTIES, THE UNION OF THE
NATIONAL CENTER, HAS ADOPTED A POSITIVE ATTITUDE BY MAKING SUGGESTIONS
TO THE GOVERNMENT ON HOW TO CONTROL CRIME.  WE ARE GOING TO STUDY
THEIR PROPOSALS.  WE BELIEVE THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROPOSALS COME FROM AN
OPPOSITION PARTY, WE SHOULD ANALYZE THEM.  WE URGE ALL SECTORS IN
GUATEMALAN SOCIETY NOT TO SIMPLY ADOPT THE EASY ATTITUDE OF ACCUSING
THE GOVERNMENT.  WE SHOULD INSTEAD ADOPT THE ATTITUDE OF REJECTING
CRIME."

   REGARDING THE PROPOSALS HE WILL MAKE DURING HIS UPCOMING VISIT TO
THE UN HEARDQUARTERS AND THE RECENT ATTACKS IN GUATEMALA, WHICH HE
SAID ARE AIMED AT DESTROYING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS ACHIEVED DURING THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, CEREZO AREVALO ADDED:

   [CEREZO] "AMONG THE ISSUES WE ARE GOING TO POINT OUT IS THAT, AT
THIS MOMENT, GUATEMALA IS THE TARGET OF AN ATTEMP TO UNDERMINE THE
CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY.  WE ARE GOING TO NEED THE HELP OF
DEMOCRACIES THAT ARE FRIENDS OF GUATEMALA, BUT NOT IN THE CAPACITY OF
JUDGES.  WE ARE GOING TO NEED TOTAL SUPPORT TO CONTROL A DOMESTIC AND
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST OFFENSIVE THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY
AND THAT SEEKS TO DESTROY THE REPUBLIC."

   THERE ARE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN HAVING THE LARGE NUMBER OF REFUGEES
WHO HAVE RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY SINCE CEREZO WAS SWORN IN LEAVE THE
COUNTRY AGAIN TO DISCREDIT GUATEMALA, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID.

   [CEREZO] "DURING 3 AND 1/2 YEARS OF DEMOCRACY, IN WHICH WE
IMPLEMENTED PLANS AND GUARANTEED THE RIGHTS OF ALL CITIZENS, GUATEMALA
BEGAN TO WELCOME ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE: REFUGEES -- GUATEMALANS WHO HAVE
BEEN LIVING IN EXILE FOR YEARS IN MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES; PEOPLE
WHO HAD BEEN THREATENED AND WHO WERE LIVING IN COSTA RICA AND WHO HAVE
RETURNED.  WE DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE THESE PEOPLE WORK BECAUSE, FOR
US, THEY ARE GUATEMALANS WHO HAVE RETURNED.  HOWEVER, WE ARE BEGINNING
TO RECEIVE REPORTS FROM THEM.  THEY HAVE TOLD US THEY ARE BEING
SYSTEMATICALLY THREATENED OVER THE TELEPHONE.  WHO KNOWS WHERE THESE
PEOPLE ARE OR HOW THEY GOT THEIR TELEPHONE NUMBERS?  HOW IS THIS DONE?
THERE ARE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN HAVING THESE FORMER REFUGEES LEAVE THE
COUNTRY TO AGAIN REPORT THAT WE ARE VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS IN
GUATEMALA TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  I WOULD SAY
WE ARE BEING AFFECTED BY TWO TRENDS THAT ARE FIGHTING AGAINST
GUATEMALAN DEMOCRACY." [CONTINUED]

COLOMBIAN AIR FORCE [FAC] COMMANDOS AND PILOTS TODAY RECEIVED ORDERS
TO STAND READY TO TAKE OFF, INTERCEPT, CAPTURE, OR SHOOT DOWN
UNIDENTIFIED OR HOSTILE AIRCRAFT FLYING OVER THE NATION'S TERRITORY.
THE GOVERNMENT ADOPTED THESE MEASURES IN CONNECTION WITH THE STRUGGLE
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  HERE IS A REPORT BY AMPARO MONTON:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MONTON] THE ORDER WAS ISSUED BY THE COLOMBIAN AIR
FORCE COMMANDS, WHICH ALSO DECIDED TO USE GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES AND
OTHER WEAPONS ABOARD FAC AIRCRAFT.  ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS
MANUAL SENT TO ALL AIR BASES, ORDERS ARE GIVEN TO CAPTURE, DESTROY, OR
SHOOT DOWN PLANES IN 11 INSTANCES, WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: WHEN
PLANES FLY OVER FORBIDDEN OR RESTRICTED AREAS; IN THE EVENT OF
UNAUTHORIZED LANDINGS; WHEN THE [WORD INDISTINCT] DO NOT ESTABLISH
RADIO CONTACT WITH THE INTERCEPTOR PLANE FLYING OVER THEM; WHEN
AIRCRAFT LAND IN PLACES NOT AUTHORIZED BY THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS
OFFICE; WHEN THEY LAND ON CLANDESTINE AIRSTRIPS.

   INSTRUCTIONS WERE ALSO ISSUED TO ALL AIR COMMANDS TO KEEP TWO
ARMORED AIRCRAFT ON ALERT AT ALL TIMES EITHER ON THE GROUND OR IN THE
AIR.  THE ONLY EVENT IN WHICH THE SHOOTING DOWN OF A HOSTILE AIRCRAFT
MUST NOT BE CONSIDERED IS WHEN SUCH AN ACTION WOULD ENDANGER INNOCENT
PEOPLE OR OCCUPIED BUILDINGS.

   IN ADDITION, THE FAC COMMAND DIVIDED THE PROCEDURE INTO FOUR
PHASES, NAMELY: DETECTION, IDENTIFICATION, INTERCEPTION, AND
DESTRUCTION.  THESE MEASURES WILL APPLY TO ALL SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING
AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING PLANES OF COLOMBIAN OR FOREIGN REGISTRY.  [END

   MOSCOW (USSR), NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[VEDENYAPIN] DURING THE LAST 3 WEEKS IN COLOMBIA, YOU KNOW, A REAL WAR
HAS BEEN GOING ON, A WAR BEING WAGED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON THE DRUGS
MAFIA.  IN BOGOTA, MEDELLIN, CALI, AND OTHER TOWNS SHOTS ARE HEARD,
BOMBS EXPLODE, BLOOD IS FLOWING, AND MORE AND MORE OFTEN WE HEAR THE
WORDS THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.  THIS IS THE HEART OF THE COLOMBIAN MAFIA.
WHAT IS IT?  HOW DID IT FORM?  WITH THIS QUESTION I TURN TO YOU, YURIY
NIKOLAYEVICH.  INCIDENTALLY, I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN IN MEDELLIN.

   [ISAYEV] YES, WHILE WORKING IN LATIN AMERICA AS A CORRESPONDENT FOR
USSR STATE TELEVISION AND RADIO I WAS ABLE TO VISIT MEDELLIN ONCE.
THERE WAS A SEMINAR THERE ON THE PROBLEMS OF CENTRAL AMERICA.
OUTWARDLY IT IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE TOWN, VERY GREEN, SITUATED ON A
PLAIN, AND IT IS CALLED ETERNALLY BLOSSOMING.  AFTER SEVERAL HOURS IN
MEDELLIN BURSTS OF SUBMACHINEGUN FIRE RANG OUT SUDDENLY IN THE STREETS
AND I UNDERSTOOD THEN THAT I WAS IN THE CENTER OF THE COCAINE MAFIA.
TWO CLANS OF BANDITS WERE EXCHANGING FIRE AND PASSERS-BY LITERALLY HAD
TO RUN AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF EVENTS AS FAST AS THEY COULD.

   LOCAL COLLEAGUES SHOWED ME A HUGE DISTRICT CONSISTING OF LUXURIOUS
VILLAS WHERE THE GODFATHERS OF THE COLOMBIA DRUG MAFIA LIVE.  IT IS
DIFFICULT TO EVEN APPROACH THESE HOUSES: THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY BARBED
WIRE AND THERE ARE VIDEO CAMERAS AND WATCH TOWERS.  IF YOU DECIDE TO
GO FAIRLY CLOSE THE GUARDS WILL OPEN FIRE WITHOUR WARNING.  I WAS ALSO
ABLE TO SEE A NINETEENTH-CENTURY CASTLE, A RARE AND EXTREMELY
BEAUTIFUL BUILDING, A GENUINE ARCHITECTURAL MONUMENT.  THIS CASTLE
BELONGS TO ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MAFIA, CARLOS LEHDER.

   [VEDENYAPIN] YES, YURIY NIKOLAEVICH, BUT HOW WAS THE MEDELLIN
CARTEL FORMED?  SOME INFORMATION ON ITS HISTORY, IF YOU COULD.

   [ISAYEV] BY RIGHTS THE FOUNDER OF THE CARTEL IS CONSIDERED TO BE
CARLOS ENRIQUE LEHDER, WHO WAS ABLE TO UNITE THE COCAINE MAFIA OF
COLOMBIA AROUND HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTIES.  A FEW WORDS
ABOUT LEHDER HIMSELF: HE IS A DESPERATE EXTREMIST WHO HOLDS NOTHING
SACRED.  HE HAS HUNDREDS OF HUMAN LIVES ON HIS CONSCIENCE.  IT IS NOT
FOR NOTHING THAT HIS FRIENDS GAVE HIM AT VARIOUS TIMES THE NICK NAMES
RUM ROBIN HOOD, THE DRUGS BARON, AND SO ON.  CARLOS LEHDER IS
DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS AUDACITY AND A RESTLESS DISPOSITION.  TOGETHER
WITH HIM OTHER COLOMBIAN FAMILIES HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN THIS
ADVANTAGEOUS BUSINESS, NAMELY THE OCHOA AND ESCOBAR FAMILIES.  AT THE
END OF THE EIGHTIES [AS HEARD] A COCAINE WAR BEGAN BETWEEN THESE THREE
CLANS.  LATER, HOWEVER, THEY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT AND THE MEDELLIN
CARTEL WAS FORMED

   [VEDENYAPIN] IN THE PRESS MANY REPORTS HAVE APPEARED STATING THAT
LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE CARTEL.
IS THIS TRUE?

   [ISAYEV] THE CARTEL'S ANNUAL INCOME, AS THE PRESS CLAIMS, IS $8
BILLION.  TO SKETCH THE SCALE OF COCAINE OPERATIONS I WILL REMIND YOU
THAT IN 1984, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CARTEL BIGWIGS PROPOSED TO THE
GOVERNMENT TO CLEAR COLOMBIA'S ENTIRE FOREIGN DEBT WITHIN A WEEK --
AND I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THIS IS $9 BILLION -- IF THE GOVERNMENT
WOULD RELEASE MAFIA MEMBERS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED.  NOT VERY LONG AGO
A WEST GERMAN MAGAZINE PUBLISHED A LIST OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE
WORLD AND ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL -- JORGE OCHOA -- IS
BY NO MEANS LAST ON THAT LIST.  I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION ANOTHER CASE
THAT CHARACTERIZES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DRUG MAFIA'S MEANS. FOUR
YEARS AGO IT CAME TO LIGHT THAT THE CARTEL HAD TAKEN PART IN
NEGOTIATIONS ON BUYING A WHOLE CONSIGNMENT OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES,
SEVERAL MILITARY HELICOPTERS, AND OTHER MODERN WEAPONS.

   [VEDENYAPIN] HOW IS THIS LETHAL ARSENAL USED?

   [ISAYEV] IT IS COMPLETELY NATURAL THAT THE CARTEL COULD NOT EXIST
WITHOUT A COMPLETE ARMY OF MERCENARY KILLERS AND INFORMANTS WHO HAVE
PENETRATED INTO LITERALLY ALL SPHERES OF THE COLOMBIAN ECONOMY,
PARLIAMENT, AND THE ARMY.  THE MAIN TARGET OF THE MAFIOSI ARE
PROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS, WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THREATEN THE DRUGS
BUSINESS.  I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THE SAME CARLOS LEHDER IN 1984
ORGANIZED THE ASSASSINATION OF LARA BONILLA, THE COLOMBIAN MINISTER OF
JUSTICE.  IN 1986 GUILLERMO CANO, THE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRESSIVE
NEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR WAS MURDERED, AND IT WAS BASICALLY AFTER THIS
MUDER THAT THE HUNT FOR LEHDER BEGAN.  IN THE SAME YEAR HE WAS
ARRESTED AND HANDED OVER TO U.S. JUSTICE, WHICH SENTENCED HIM TO LIFE
IMPRISONMENT.  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE EXISTS AN AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENTS ON THE EXTRADITION OF
ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS.

   [VEDENYAPIN] IF WE TAKE THE PRESENT WAR -- IT CANNOT BE CALLED
ANYTHING ELSE -- WHAT WERE ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSES? [CONTINUED]

THAT A HOMEMADE ROCKET WAS LAUNCHED AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE U.S.
EMBASSY IN BOGOTA THIS EVENING.  NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE WERE REPORTED.

   THE ROCKET PARTIALLY PERFORATED ONE OF THE WALLS OF THE EMBASSY,
BUT DID NOT EXPLODE.

   THE ALREADY TIGHT SECURITY SURROUNDING THE EMBASSY SINCE THE WAR
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFIC WAS DECLARED WAS STEPPED UP IMMEDIATELY AND
TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIANS WERE KEPT OUT OF THE AREA.

   THIS ATTACKED FOLLOWED THE TWO DYNAMITE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCURRED
EARLY SUNDAY EVENING IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF BOGOTA WHERE ONE PERSON
WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED AND APPROXIMATELY 30 LOCALS WERE DAMAGED.

   DURING THE BELISARIO BETACUR ADMINISTRATION (1982 - 1986), WHEN
SEVERAL COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED
STATES, THE U.S. EMBASSY WAS ATTACKED IN A SIMILAR MANNER.  NO
INJURIES WERE REPORTED DURING THAT ATTACK.  LATER, HOWEVER, A BOMB
EXPLODED IN THE EMBASSY'S PARKING LOT KILLING A COLOMBIAN WOMAN WHO
WAS STANDING IN LINE TO GET A VISA.

   LIKE IN OTHER ATTACKS OF THIS KIND REPORTED OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS
IN BOGOTA AND IN OTHER CITIES, NO ORGANIZATION HAS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK; HOWEVER, THE PRESS AND THE AUTHORITIES
ARE BLAMING PERSONS IN THE SERVICE OF THE DRUG LORDS.

   DHAKA (BANGLADESH), 9 SEP 89 (THE BANGLADESH OBSERVER) -- [TEXT]
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS DECLARED HIS COUNTRY'S WAR AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKERS IN A DRAMATIC MANNER, COMMITTING A MASSIVE FUND OF $7.86
BILLION FOR THE PROGRAMME, PROVIDING INCREASED POWERS TO
LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND EVEN OFFERING SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY IN LATIN AMERICA, FIGHTING
THIS MENACE.  TO DEAL WITH WHAT HE CALLED, "AMERICA'S TOUGHEST
DOMESTIC TEST IN DECADES" DURING HIS STERN ADDRESS ON TUESDAY, THE US
LEADER HAS GIVEN A NEW BOOST TO THE CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL CRUSADE
AGAINST NARCOTICS.

   THIS NEW INITIATIVE WILL BE WARMLY WELCOMED BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY,
MOST OF ALL BY LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY COLOMBIA WHICH IS
FIGHTING A DESPERATE BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE BARONS.  THE NEWS FROM
BOGOTA IS SIMPLY FRIGHTENING.  IN THE COUNTRY'S LONG WAR AGAINST DRUG
DEALERS, NOTHING LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW -- THE MERCILESS KILLING
OF SECURITY OFFICERS AND THEIR RELATIVES -- HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
SHOULD COLOMBIA LOSE THIS WAR AGAINST COCAINE BARONS, DRUG LORDS IN
OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WILL FLEX THEIR MUSCLES TOO.  TO PUT IT
PLAINLY, COLOMBIA CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS WAR.  BUT WHETHER SHE
WINS OR LOSSES THIS BATTLE DEPENDS ON WHAT ASSISTANCE THE UNITED
STATES CAN PROVIDE TO THIS LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   HERE, COLOMBIA FACES DIFFICULT OPTIONS.  WHILE SHE HAS ACCEPTED
SOME LOGISTIC SUPPORT, SUCH AS HELICOPTERS, FROM WASHINGTON, SHE
MAINTAINS HERE OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF US TROOPS IN TACKLING WHAT SHE
RIGHTLY REGARDS AS A DOMESTIC CRISIS.  THE STATEMENT BY MR BUSH ON
WEDNESDAY HAS SO FAR MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THIS OPPOSITION.  THE
PROBLEM FACING BOGOTA IS, WHILE AN INCREASE IN THE LOGISTIC SUPPORT
FROM US WOULD HELP, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT OVERNIGHT RAISE THE STRENGTH
OF ITS ANI-NARCOTIC SECURITY FORCES.  WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
OFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES, BOGOTA CAN, OF COURSE, BUY ARMS FOR USE
AGAINST DRUG BARONS.  BUT THE BATTLE WILL STILL BE HARD AND LONG.

   IN FIGHTING THIS RELENTLESS BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE DEALERS,
COLOMBIA HAS MADE ONE PERFECTLY VALID POINT, MORE THAN ONCE.  TRUE, IT
IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA TO WIN ITS
INTERNAL WAR, WITH ALL THE HELP THAT WASHINGTON CAN PROVIDE.  BUT THE
REAL BATTLE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS MUST BE FOUGHT WITHIN THE UNITED
STATES, ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, CHICAGO AND ALL OTHER
CITIES.  THIS IS THE MARKET FOR THE COCAINE BARONS OF COLOMBIA OR FOR
THE DRUGS PRODUCED IN THE INFAMOUS GOLDEN TRIANGLE IN ASIA.  AND IT IS
ALSO WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WHERE ALL THE CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION,
SOME CONTROLLED BY US CITIZENS, THRIVE UNDER THE EYES OF THE US LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MAY ASK IF ENOUGH
HAS BEEN DONE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AT THE US END.

   THIS STATEMENT BY MR BUSH SUGGESTS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS
RECOGNISED THIS BASIC PROBLEM AND WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  A
MAJOR PORTION OF THE FUNDING SUPPORT FOR THE ANTI-DRUG WAR WILL BE
USED IN STRENGTHENING THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITHIN THE UNITED
STATES.  BUT QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THE US CONGRESS
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH IN THAT DIRECTION.  IN FACT,
THERE IS SOME DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN HAS NOT BEEN
"BOLD ENOUGH" EITHER.  WHILE ONE MUST ADMIT THAT THE US CONGRESSMEN
ARE USED TO MAKING SUCH CRITICISMS AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION ON
PROBLEM ON WHICH THEY THEMSELVES RARELY OFFER ANY NEW INITIATIVE, ONE
HOPES THAT THE US ADMINISTRATION WILL KEEP ITS NEWLY-UNVEILED
ANTI-DRUG PLAN UNDER CONSTANT SCRUTINY AND ENSURE THAT THE BATTLE THAT
COLOMBIA IS BEING URGED TO WIN AT ALL COSTS IS NOT LOST WITHIN THE
UNITED STATES.

   WE HAVE NOT SOWN IN THE DESERT OR PLOWED AT SEA.  THESE PAST 16

   IN EFFECT, THE PLEBISCITE WAS A HARSH BLOW FOR PINOCHET. I THINK

ASSERT HERE THAT PINOCHET'S DEFEAT IN THE ELECTION WILL BE THE

DEMOCRATIC OPENING YET.  HOWEVER, IN OUR OPINION IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
REPRESENT ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD.

   PINOCHET WILL TRY TO STAY ON AS HEAD OF THE ARMY AND AS HEAD OF THE
ARMED FORCES.  WE COULD ALMOST SAY THAT HE WILL STAY ON AS A SORT OF
SENTINEL, A POWER ON WHICH THE COUNTRY'S DESTINY WOULD CONTINUE TO
HANG FOR SOME TIME TO COME.  WHETHER HE CAN REALLY FULFILL THE GOALS
HE HAS SET FOR HIMSELF REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  HOWEVER, I AM CERTAIN HE
WILL NOT GIVE UP POWER WITHOUT A STRUGGLE.  ONLY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE
CAN MAKE THIS AN IRREVERSIBLE STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE A TRUE AND FULL
DEMOCRATIC OPENING, AN OPENING WITHOUT ALL OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT THE
REGIME HAS WRITTEN INTO ITS CONSTITUTION, WHICH GRANTS HIM ALL OF
THESE RIGHTS -- TO BE A SENATOR FOR LIFE, AND, IF MY MEMORY DOES NOT
FAIL ME, TO SERVE AS CHIEF OF THE ARMY FOR AN ADDITIONAL 8 YEARS.
LOOK AT HIS HARANGUES.  HIS HARANGUES ARE STILL AGGRESSIVE, HAUGHTY,
AND THREATENING.  WE HEAR WARNINGS.  WE HEAR APPEALS TO THE ARMY TO
REMAIN UNITED, BECAUSE HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY TRY TO PERPETUATE HIMSELF.

   I THINK HE WILL BE MORE AND MORE CORNERED BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE,
BECAUSE A NEW STAGE WILL BEGIN AFTER THE ELECTIONS.  IT IS INEVITABLE
THAT THE PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT.  THEY WILL
INEVITABLY HAVE A MUCH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF EXPRESSING THEMSELVES,
OF ACTING, OF MOBILIZING, OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AT THE
MOMENT AND NOT ABOUT SHARES OF POWER.  I THINK THEY HAVE TO
BE...[CHANGES THOUGHT] THAT THIS IS REALLY AN ADMIRABLE TEST OF
PATRIOTIC AND REVOLUTIONARY FEELING FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT RIGHTISTS,
FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT CONSERVATIVES, FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT EVEN IN THE
CENTER BUT ON THE LEFT, AND WELL TO THE LEFT: TO GO TO THE POLLS AND
TO VOTE, FORGETTING WHICH PARTY IT WAS THAT PUT FORWARD THE CANDIDATE
FOR PRESIDENT, OR WHAT THE CANDIDATE'S POLITICAL THINKING IS, JUST
THINKING OF CHILE, ONLY THINKING OF CHILE.  [CONTINUED]

   BUENOS AIRES, 19 SEP 89 (NA) -- [TEXT] VICE PRESIDENT EDUARDO
DUHALDE SAID TODAY THAT THE PROBLEM CREATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN
COLOMBIA "CANNOT" OCCUR IN ARGENTINA BECAUSE IN COLOMBIA THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS PRACTICALLY CREATED A "PARALLEL GOVERNMENT WITH THE IDEA
OF TAKING POWER."

   DUHALDE SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF "SENDING TROOPS TO THAT COUNTRY IF ITS
LEADERS REQUEST THEM" BECAUSE IN COLOMBIA THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS NOT
ONLY BUY "LARGE ENTERPRISES, COMPANIES, BANKS, AND OFFICES," BUT ALSO
"HAVE THEIR OWN POLITICIANS, POLICEMEN, TEACHERS, AND OFFICIALS."

   IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH NA DUHALDE CALLED ON SOCIETY TO THE
"PREVENT" DRUG ADDICTION IN ARGENTINA.

   THE COLOMBIAN SITUATION "IS A MILITARY ISSUE BECAUSE A REAL WAR IS
TAKING PLACE," DUHALDE SAID. HE ADDED THAT COLOMBIA IS "DIVIDED INTO
TWO COUNTRIES: THE LEGAL COUNTRY AND THE ONE RUN BY NARCOTICS." HE
SAID, "I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE LEGAL WILL WIN."

   ACCORDING TO DUHALDE WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN COLOMBIA "CANNOT OCCUR
IN ARGENTINA FOR SEVERAL DECADES." HE SAID THAT HE PERSONALLY SUPPORTS
THE IDEA OF "SENDING TROOPS TO COLOMBIA IF ITS LEADERS REQUEST THEM."
HOWEVER, HE EXPLAINED: "THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY
CONGRESS."

   HE POINTED OUT THAT "DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY OPERATING IN
THE COUNTRY BUT THEIR NATIONALITIES ARE NOT KNOWN." HE ADDED THAT
"THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT DISTRIBUTES THE DRUG IN ARGENTINA."

   DUHALDE SAID: "WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN COLOMBIA IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE
OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE CONTINENT -- THE PRODUCTION AND
TRAFFICKING OF DRUGS." HE ADDED: "DRUGS ARE NOT PRODUCED IN ARGENTINA.
THEY ARE BROUGHT FROM COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU."

   HE SAID: "IN 1988 IN MY BOOK 'POLITICIANS AND DRUGS' I WARNED ABOUT
THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS CLOSELY LINKED TO
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS SHINING PATH IN PERU AND M-19 IN
COLOMBIA."

   DUHALDE INDICATED THAT "THE STRUGGLE IS AGAINST THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. IDEOLOGIES ARE NOT INVOLVED HERE
BECAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN COLOMBIA THE TRAFFICKERS ARE OF THE EXTREME
RIGHT -- NATIONALISTS."

   HE ADDED THAT "THE DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEM IN ARGENTINA INVOLVES
YOUTHS FROM 13 TO 20 YEARS OF AGE" AND THAT THAT IS WHY "PREVENTION
MEASURES SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS, WHERE WE SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE ILLS DRUGS CAUSE."

   DUHALDE, WHO IS GOING TO TOUR THE COUNTRY TO LECTURE ON "HOW TO
PREVENT DRUG ADDICTION," SAID THAT "IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO
INCLUDE THAT ISSUE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, BECAUSE TEACHERS CAN
BECOME THE REAL FORCE FOR ENDING DRUG ADDICTION."

   HE REVEALED THAT COCAINE CONSUMPTION IN THE COUNTRY IS COMING CLOSE
TO MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIGHER." HE SAID THAT
IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE "VERY HARSH REGULATIONS," SUCH AS THE DEATH
PENALTY, "FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMIT HOMICIDES AS THEY ARE DOING IN
COLOMBIA."

   REGARDING THE CHAOTIC COLOMBIAN SITUATION, DUHALDE SAID: "DRUG
TRAFFICKERS ARE A SORT OF PARALLEL GOVERNMENT THAT AIMS TO TAKE POWER.
I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE
THEIR OWN POLITICIANS, POLICEMEN, TEACHERS, AND OFFICIALS."

   HE SAID: "THIS IS NOT ONLY A COLOMBIAN PROBLEM; IT IS A CONTINENTAL
PROBLEM THAT NO ONE CAN SOLVE ALONE, NOT EVEN THE UNITED STATES. THAT
IS WHY JOINT ACTION IS NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE THOSE TRAFFICKERS IN
DEATH."

   REGARDING HIS RECENT TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES, DUHALDE SAID THAT
HIS TALKS "DID NOT INCLUDE POSSIBLE U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE COUNTRIES
WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN SITUATION HAD
NOT YET DEVELOPED TO ITS CURRENT STAGE."

   HE CALLED THE COLOMBIAN CARTELS "MAFIA GANGS" THAT ARE "TRYING TO
SET UP A DISTRIBUTION NETWORK" FOR THEIR MERCHANDISE WHICH GIVES THEM
A PROFIT OF ABOUT $150 BILLION A YEAR ON SALES OF $500 BILLION."

   DUHALDE SAID THAT "THE DRUG LORDS BUY LARGE ENTERPRISES, COMPANIES,
BANKS, AND OFFICES. THEY ALSO FORM RELATIONS WITH POLITICIANS AND
MILITARY MEN." HE ADDED THAT "THEY HAVE A GREAT ABILITY TO CORRUPT,"
AND "THEY SETTLE IN ONE PLACE WHEN THEY ARE SURE THEY WILL NOT BE
ARRESTED."

   HAVANA (CUBA), 16 SEP 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[MANOLO ORTEGA] [TEXT] FOR THE FIRST TIME IN VIRTUALLY 10 YEARS OF
ARMED CONFLICT, WHICH HAS CLAIMED ALMOST 70,000 LIVES, THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLAS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT RECENTLY IN MEXICO CITY.
THIS COULD MARK THE BEGINNING OF AN UNPRECEDENTED PATH OF PEACE FOR
THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   AFTER 2 DAYS OF TALKS, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] REPRESENTATIVES AND SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES AGREED TO
ESTABLISH A PERMANENT DIALOGUE TO SECURE A DEFINITE CEASE-FIRE.  ON 16
AND 17 OCTOBER, THE COSTA RICAN CAPITAL WILL HOST THE MEETING BETWEEN
THE NEGOTIATING PARTIES.  THE EVENT WILL BE ATTENDED BY TWO
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS MEDIATORS FOR THE SALVADORAN
EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE.  UN AND OAS REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE INVITED TO
ATTEND AS WITNESSES.

   ASIDE FROM MATTERS OF PROCEDURE, IT IS WORTHWHILE TO SAY THAT, IN
ADDITION TO BEING DECISIVE IN ACHIEVING A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN
INTERNAL CRISIS, THE REBELS' RECENT PEACE INITIATIVE WAS A STRONG BLOW
TO THE RULING ULTRA-RIGHTIST SECTOR.  THE REBELS' WILLINGNESS TO END
HOSTILITIES AND TURN THE FMLN INTO A POLITICAL PARTY PLACED BEFORE
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI THE DECISION OF CONTINUING THE WAR OR
OPTING FOR PEACE.

   AS OF THAT MOMENT, AND IN VIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE ASSIGNED TO THE
TALKS BY THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA AND ANALYSTS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC
OPINION KEPT ABREAST OF THE DIALOGUE, WHICH IS SO VITAL FOR EL
SALVADOR AND FOR CENTRAL AMERICA.  FOR THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE [ARENA], THE PROPOSALS WERE CLEARLY DEFINED TO AGREE ON A
TOTAL CEASE-FIRE BEFORE 31 JANUARY, TO END THE REPRESSION, TO CONDUCT
A PURGE IN THE ARMY, AND TO REORGANIZE THE JUDICIAL AND ELECTORAL
SYSTEM.

   ALTHOUGH DETAILS WERE NOT GIVEN ON HOW THE ISSUES WILL BE HANDLED,
THE FACT REMAINS THAT DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES WILL BEGIN
IN ONLY A MONTH.  IT MEANS THAT THE VEILED GOVERNMENT INTENTION TO
DELAY THE TALKS AND CONTINUE THE WAR, WHICH IT CANNOT WIN IN ANY
EVENT, HAS FAILED.  WE MIGHT EVEN ADD THAT THE ARENA GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE FROM THE BEGINNING, ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE
TELA SUMMIT WHICH APPEALED TO THE SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES TO HOLD
DIALOGUE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH THE REBELS.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S
ATTEMPT TO SECURE THE FORCEFUL DEMOBILIZATION OF THE GUERRILLAS AND
HIS ATTEMPT TO COMPARE THESE FORCES WITH THE NICARAGUAN
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES ALSO FAILED.

   THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AND ITS
WILLINGNESS TO SECURE A DEFINITIVE PEACE AGREEMENT WILL BE IN EVIDENCE
AT THE NEXT MEETINGS.  MEANWHILE, THE PROSPECTS FOR ACHIEVING PEACE IN
THE COUNTRY APPEAR TO BE FAVORABLE.  


DEV-MUC3-0498 (UMASS)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 20 SEP 89 (TASS) -- [TEXT] THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MASS
MEDIA HAS REGARDED THE INTENTION OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EXISTING
CONSTITUTION AS A DEVIATION FROM RECENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE REBELS.

   THE INTENTION IS OUTLINED IN A STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRESIDENT IN
REPSONSE TO THE REBEL PROPOSAL TO GIVE UP THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND JOIN
THE POLITICAL LIFE IF THE ARMY CLEANS UP ITS RANKS, IF REPRESSIONS ARE
STOPPED, ELECTIONS TO MUNICIPAL AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES ARE HELD
EARLIER THAN 1991 AND IF THE ELECTION SYSTEM IS REFORMED.

   ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN MASS MEDIA, THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS
WILL BE DOMINATE THE FMLN TALKS WITH THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN
COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER.

   AT THE SAME TIME, THE SALVADORAN POLICE HAVE STAGED ANOTHER ACT OF
VIOLENCE IN SAN SALVADOR.  SPECIAL POLICE UNITS DISPERSED A
DEMONSTRATION ORGANISED BY THE FEDERATION OF SALVADORAN TRADE UNIONS
IN PROTEST AGAINST THE ARREST OF 12 ACTIVISTS OF WORKERS' AND PEASANT
ORGANISATIONS.  ABOUT 100 DEMONSTRATORS SHELTERED IN A CATHEDRAL.
BUT, THE POLICE SMASHED THE CATHEDRAL'S WINDOWS AND SHOT TEAR GAS INTO
THE BUILDING.  POLICEMEN ALSO OPENED FIRE AND ARMY HELICOPTERS CIRCLED
OVER THE CATHEDRAL.

   DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE INSIDE WERE WOUNDED, THE POLICE
DID NOT ALLOW RED CROSS REPRESENTATIVES TO APPROACH THE CATHEDRAL, AS
DEMONSTRATORS DEMANDED.

   ABOUT 60 DEMONSTRATORS WERE FIRST BRUTALLY BEATEN AND THEN
ARRESTED, THE SAN SALVADORAN MASS MEDIA SAID.  


DEV-MUC3-0499 (UMASS)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 10 SEP 89 (MOSCOW) -- [REPORT] [LEONID LEVCHENKO]
[TEXT] A U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SPOKESMAN HAS INDICATED THAT
WASHINGTON PROPOSES TO CONTINUE HELPING THE SALVADORAN REGIME UNTIL
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] COMBATANTS
SURRENDER THEIR ARMS.

   THE TIMING OF THIS STATEMENT IS REMARKABLE.  LET US RECALL THAT
LESS THAN 1 WEEK AGO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REBEL FORCES AND THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT MET IN MEXICO, THUS LAUNCHING A DIALOGUE AIMED
AT A NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.  THE PARTIES AGREED TO CONTINUE THESE
TALKS IN COSTA RICA ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER, HOWEVER, EVEN THE FIRST
ROUND OF TALKS IN MEXICO SHOWED THAT CONTINUING THE WAR WAS POINTLESS
BECAUSE NEITHER OF THE PARTIES IS CAPABLE OF MILITARY DEFEATING THE
OTHER.  THUS, THE ONLY POSSIBLE VICTORY FOR ALL IS THE VICTORY OF
COMMON SENSE.  THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY THROUGH NATIONAL DIALOGUE.
THE REBELS HAVE CORRECTLY MADE IT CLEAR THAT NO PRECONDITIONS CAN BE
SET FOR CONTINUING DIALOGUE, AND LESS STILL CAN IT BE DEMANDED THAT
THE FMLN COMBATANTS SHOULD UNILATERALLY SURRENDER THEIR ARMS.

   IT SHOULD BE NOTED THIS DEMAND IS BEING MADE WHILE THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT IS GETTING CONSIDERABLE MILITARY AID FROM THE UNITED STATES
AND, ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE SPOKESMAN, IT HAS NO PLANS
TO DISCONTINUE THIS AID.

   THE SALVADORAN MILITARY IS USING U.S.-MADE WEAPONS ONLY AGAINST THE
REBELS AND NOT AGAINST ANY FOREIGN ENEMY.  IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT
THROUGHOUT THE 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR IN EL SALVADOR, THE UNITED STATES
HAS SUPPLIED ALMOST $4 BILLION WORTH OF MILITARY AND NONMILITARY AID
TO THAT COUNTRY.  THANKS TO THIS ASSISTANCE, 70,000 SALVADORANS HAVE
BEEN KILLED AND OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO
SAVE THEIR LIVES.

   WE CAN SEE THAT ADDITIONAL U.S. MILITARY AID WILL INFLICT FURTHER
UNTOLD SUFFERING AND MISFORTUNES ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  PUTTING AN
END TO THIS ASSISTANCE AND TO ANY FURTHER INTERFERENCE IN SALVADORAN
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS WOULD HELP DISPEL MUTUAL DISTRUST AND WOULD CREATE IN
THE COUNTRY AN ATMOSPHERE FAVORABLE TO NATIONAL DIALOGUE.
WASHINGTON'S DEMANDS THAT THE REBELS SHOULD SURRENDER THEIR ARMS AS A
PRECONDITION FOR WASHINGTON TO RECONSIDER THE ISSUE OF MILITARY AID TO
THE SALVADORAN REGIME REPRESENTS, AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED,
UNACCEPTABLE INTERFERENCE IN EL SALVADOR'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.

   UNDOUBTEDLY, THE PROCESS OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION MUST TAKE PLACE
FREE OF ANY FOREIGN INTERFERENCE WHATSOEVER.  I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE
JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, A REBEL LEADER, WHO TOLD THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT
THE END OF U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN REGIME WOULD LEAD TO AN
IMMEDIATE END TO THE WAR.
