   LIMA, 8 MAY 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [EXCERPTS] SENATOR LUIS
ALBERTO SANCHEZ HAS BEEN DESIGNATED NEW PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF
MINISTERS.  THIS WAS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA ON ARRIVING AT
GOVERNMENT PALACE AFTER PAYING HOMAGE IN CONGRESS TO LATE [APRA
AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] DEPUTY PABLO LI ORMENO.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALAN GARCIA] I THINK IT IS A BARBAROUS CRIME WHICH WE
MUST REPUDIATE AND AGAINST WHICH WE MUST ALL FIGHT.

   WE NEED TO PUT ALL POLICE FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM.  WE
CAN NO LONGER SCATTER OUR EFFORTS AND KEEP SOME SECTORS IDLE.  I HAVE SEEN
POLICE AGENTS WORKING AS DRIVERS, SOME OF THEM PLAYING THE ROLE OF GREAT
PERSONALITIES, OF CHIEFS. I HAVE SEEN MANY POLICEMEN DOING ADMINISTRATIVE
WORK.  WE ARE PAYING THOSE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TRAINED THEM TO FIGHT AGAINST
OUR MAIN ENEMY, WHICH IS TERRORISM.

   I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, AND
WITH HIM ALL MEMBERS OF THE MINISTERIAL CABINET, HAVE PRESENTED THEIR
RESIGNATIONS.  PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA FEELS THAT A POLITICAL
RENEWAL IS NECESSARY TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE DEMOCRATIC SECTORS TO
PARTICIPATE MORE ACTIVELY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SUBVERSION.  THE MURDER OF
ANOTHER CONGRESSMAN HAS LED THE MINISTERS TO PRESENT THEIR RESIGNATIONS.

   THIS POLITICAL RENEWAL MUST LEAD ALL PERUVIANS TO JOIN EFFORTS.  WE MUST
FORGET OUR ELECTORAL CONFRONTATIONS AND ADVERSITIES FOR A WHILE AND
UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE
ELECTIONS.  WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM, THAT WE
ARE AT WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THAT THIS WAR REPRESENTS A COST OF
THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF INTIS, DOZENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  WE MUST MAKE
THIS TREMENDOUS EFFORT TO END SUBVERSION ONCE AND FOR ALL. [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 MAY 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] OFFICIAL SOURCES REPORTED TODAY
THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA GROUPS HAVE INCREASED THEIR SABOTAGE AGAINST
THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, LEAVING 40 PERCENT
OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, WHILE INTERMITTENT
BLACKOUTS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE ENTIRE EASTERN ZONE OF THE COUNTRY WAS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY TODAY,
ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE
COMMISSION (CEL), WHICH STATED THAT ON MONDAY, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS BLEW UP SEVERAL STRUCTURES IN THAT REGION.

   THE REPORT ADDED THAT THE SABOTAGE OCCURRED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN
DEPARTMENT, WHERE OTHER STRUCTURES WERE ALSO BLOWN UP EARLY THIS MORNING.
IN THIS CAPITAL, FMLN URBAN COMMANDOES BLEW UP AT LEAST THREE POLES
SUPPORTING SECONDARY LINES, AND AN AS YET UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF POLES AND
TOWERS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE COUNTRY'S CENTRAL AND WESTERN REGION.

   IN THE WAKE OF THE NEW ATTACKS AGAINST THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, ON MONDAY
THE CEL STARTED A TURBOGAS PLANT IN THE EASTERN CITY OF SAN MIGUEL TO
PARTIALLY SOLVE THE COUNTRY'S ENERGY CRISIS.

   MEANWHILE, NATIONAL POLICE DIRECTOR COLONEL CARLOS GUZMAN SAID THAT THE
FMLN WILL ACCELERATE THE SABOTAGE AS 1 JUNE APPROACHES, WHEN THE RIGHT-WING
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) WILL TAKE POWER.

   COL GUZMAN ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE HAS DISCOVERED
"PLANS TO MURDER" ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND MEMBERS AND FUTURE ARENA
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS.  GUZMAN ADDED THAT THE PLANS WOULD BE CARRIED OUT
BY FMLN URBAN COMMANDOS.  "THE DEATH THREATS DO NOT FRIGHTEN US," HE SAID,
WITHOUT PROVIDING DETAILS ON THE GUERRILLAS' PLANS TO CARRY OUT THE
MURDERS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 MAY 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS, COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE 3D INFANTRY
BRIGADE IN SAN MIGUEL, BY STATION CORRESPONDENT SORTO] [TEXT]
CONCERNING A LAST-MINUTE REPORT WHICH INTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCIES ARE
ATTRIBUTING TO A CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN
OPERATION CONCERNING ATTACKS AGAINST SEVERAL MILITARY GARRISONS IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WE INTERVIEWED COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO
VARGAS, COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE STATIONED IN SAN
MIGUEL.  WE CONTACTED HIM BY TELEPHONE, AS FOLLOWS:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SORTO] COLONEL, IS IT TRUE THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL
OR NATIONAL OPERATION TO ATTACK THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE?

   [VARGAS] I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL OR NATIONAL
OPERATION.  ALL I KNOW IS THAT THESE ARE TREACHEROUS, COWARDLY ACTIONS,
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF CONFRONTING THE SOLDIERS, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE
MILITARY UNITS.  IN SAN MIGUEL, THERE WERE FIVE EXPLOSIONS IN OPEN AREAS
ABOUT 2 TO 3 KM APART.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE
INFLICTED ON THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE OR ITS INSTALLATIONS.  THEY HIT SOME
FUEL TANKS FILLED WITH ABOUT 3,000 GALLONS OF GASOLINE, WHICH STARTED A
FIRE.  HOWEVER, THE FIRES WERE IN OPEN AREAS, SO THERE HAVE BEEN NO
CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE TO THE INSTALLATIONS.

   [SORTO] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] CLAIMS IT
SEIZED EL SALITRE ESTATE AND, FROM THERE, ATTACKED THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE.

   [VARGAS] EL SALITRE ESTATE WAS NOT OCCUPIED.  AN OLD SHACK ON THE ESTATE
WAS SET ABLAZE, BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CONTROLLED THE FIRE.  I THINK THESE
ARE THE GREAT REVOLUTIONARY VICTORIES THE FMLN TALKS ABOUT: ATTACKS AGAINST
FIXED INSTALLATIONS THAT CONTAIN NO MILITARY UNITS, WHERE NOT EVEN PEASANTS
ARE SLEEPING AT THE TIME.  I BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE THE FMLN SAYS IT FIGHTS
HEROICALLY FOR 4 HOURS TO BURN SEVEN PATCHES OF CROPS AND HOW IT CLAIMS IT
HEROICALLY FIGHTS TO DOWN POWER TOWERS, WHICH ARE UNMOVING OBJECTS.  THESE
ARE THE ONLY GREAT ACTIONS IT CARRIES OUT, BUT THESE ACTIONS ARE AGAINST
FIXED TARGETS THAT CANNOT MOVE.  I REPEAT, THESE ARE COWARDLY ACTIONS THAT
DO NOT CONFRONT THE SOLDIERS WHO REPRESENT THE MILITARY ABILITIES OF THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY.

   [SORTO] DO YOU HAVE ANY UNITS COMBING THE AREA?  

   [VARGAS] YES, DEFINITELY, WE HAVE MEN IN THE AREA.  THE TRUTH IS THAT
AT 0200 TODAY, UNITS WERE BEING MOBILIZED.  AS I SAID, THESE ARE COWARDLY
ACTIONS, CARRIED OUT IN THE DARK, AND THE FMLN FLEES WHEN IT SEES OUR
WELL-TRAINED MEN IN MILITARY UNIFORM.  THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

   [SORTO] YOU HAVE PERMANENT GUARDS FOR SAN MIGUEL.  SOME OF THE MARKET
VENDORS TOLD US FOR THE FIRST TIME, NOT A SINGLE SHOT WAS HEARD.

   [VARGAS] YES, THAT IS RIGHT.  AS I SAID, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY ATTACKS
OR HARASSMENT, JUST FIVE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, WHICH DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY
CHANGES IN THE CORRELATION OF MILITARY FORCES.  THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL
SHOULD BE CALM; WE WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH SECURITY.  THE PEOPLE OF THE
EASTERN AREA OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE CALM, BECAUSE WE WILL INCREASE OUR
ABILITIES AND EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL THE SECURITY POSSIBLE.  THE
FMLN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR BEING SO AUDACIOUS.

   [SORTO] THE FMLN SAID IT WAS FIGHTING IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA.  

   [VARGAS] WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY ACTION IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA.  WE
HAVE REPORTS THAT IN SAN ILDEFONSO, SAN VICENTE DEPARTMENT -- SOUTH OF
CABANAS -- THERE WERE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE NATIONAL GUARD -- WHICH WE
SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY -- REPORTED SOME CATAPULTS HAD
BEEN FIRED.  HOWEVER, NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED, AND I HAVE NO REPORTS OF ANY
ACTION IN OTHER PLACES.

   [SORTO] TODAY IS MOTHER'S DAY.  

   [VARGAS] YES, DEFINITELY, GREETINGS TO ALL MOTHERS:  HAVE FAITH AND
HOPE THAT YOUR SONS ARE HERE -- FROM THE GENERAL TO THE LAST SOLDIER --
AND THEY LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND ARE WORKING FOR YOU, SO YOU WILL HAVE THE
PEACE AND TRANQUILITY YOU NEED AS MOTHERS TO GENERATE LOVE AND COURAGE FOR
EACH OF YOUR SONS.  ON BEHALF OF ALL YOUR SONS, THE SOLDIERS, TO ALL
MOTHERS OF THE EASTERN AREA AND OF EL SALVADOR: RECEIVE LOVE AND KISSES.

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 MAY 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] REBEL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED
THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TODAY INFLICTED ALMOST 100
CASUALTIES ON THE SALVADORAN ARMY DURING ATTACKS ON 15 TOWNS IN 7
DEPARTMENTS.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN]
OFFICIAL RADIO STATION, SAID THE REBELS ATTACKED THE GUARDS WHO WATCH OVER
THE TOWN OF TEJUTEPEQUE IN THE NORTHEASTERN DEPARTMENT OF CABANAS,
INFLICTING 90 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING DEAD OR WOUNDED.

   THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH CONFIRMED THE ATTACK, INDICATED THAT
THE REBELS SUSTAINED 19 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING DEAD OR WOUNDED, WHILE 3
SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 6 WOUNDED IN A 2-HOUR CLASH THAT TOOK PLACE IN
TEJUTEPEQUE, 60 KM NORTHWEST OF SAN SALVADOR.  

   ACCORDING TO THE REBELS, AN OFFICER AND A SERGEANT WERE KILLED IN THE
TEJUTEPEQUE ATTACK, WHICH BEGAN EARLY IN THE MORNING OF 10 MAY.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE, COPREFA, PLAYED DOWN THE REBEL ATTACK
AND ADMITTED ANOTHER THREE ARMY CASUALTIES AND THE DEATH OF ONE GUERRILLA
DURING VARIOUS ATTACKS ON ARMY POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   THE FIRST GUERRILLA MILITARY BULLETIN BROADCAST BY THE CLANDESTINE RADIO
STATION DID NOT REPORT ANY REBEL CASUALTIES.

   THE NEW REBEL OFFENSIVE ANNOUNCED IN APRIL IS CALLED:  "EVERYBODY AGAINST
THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) AND TO STRUGGLE FOR PEACE."
WITH THAT OFFENSIVE THE REBELS INTEND TO DESTABILIZE THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF
PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WHO IS AN ARENA LEADER.

   CRISTIANI WILL ASSUME THE PRESIDENCY ON 1 JUNE AND WILL BE REPLACING
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE.

   THE REBEL STATION ADDED THAT ANOTHER THREE CASUALTIES WERE INFLICTED ON
TROOPS OF MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 3, WHO WATCH OVER THE TOWN OF ANAMOROS IN
THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF LA UNION.

   MILITARY SPOKESMEN ASSERTED THAT ONE GUERRILLA WAS KILLED DURING THE
ATTACK ON MILITARY POSITIONS IN CHIRILAGUA, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT.

   A FUEL PUMP WAS DESTROYED BY SHRAPNEL FROM EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HURLED BY
GUERRILLAS AGAINST A GARRISON OF THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERED IN
SAN MIGUEL, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD MOST IMPORTANT CITY.

   COLONEL MAURICIO VARGAS, COMMANDER OF THE 3D BRIGADE, SAID THE REBEL
ATTACKS ARE "ACTIONS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS AND ARE
TREACHEROUS AND COWARDLY ACTS BECAUSE THE REBELS ARE AFRAID TO FACE THE
SOLDIERS WHO REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY POWER."

   VARGAS SAID THE REBELS DID NOT INFLICT CASUALTIES ON OR CAUSE DAMAGE TO
THE GARRISON.

   THE GUERRILLAS ALSO ATTACKED THE SOLDIERS GUARDING TWO COFFEE MILLS IN
SANTIAGO DE MARIA, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT.  THEY DID NOT INFLICT ANY CASUALTIES.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED THAT THE REBELS DESTROYED THE MUNICIPAL OFFICE,
A GASOLINE STATION, AND THE CIVIL DEFENSE POST IN EL CONGO, SANTA ANA
DEPARTMENT.

   ACCORDING TO MILITARY SOURCES, THREE MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED CIVIL
DEFENSE WERE WOUNDED WHEN THEIR POST WAS ATTACKED IN A VILLAGE NEAR METAPAN,
SANTA ANA DEPARTMENT.

   A MILITARY SOURCE ADDED THAT A TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFICE WAS DESTROYED
AND FIVE HOUSES DAMAGED BY EXPLOSIVES IN AGUILARES, IN SAN SALVADOR'S
NORTHERN SUBURB.  

   THE REBELS SAID THEY ATTACKED MILITARY POSITIONS IN CHALATENANGO, SAN
VICENTE, LA PAZ, AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS IN NORTHERN, CENTRAL, AND
NORTHWESTERN EL SALVADOR, RESPECTIVELY, WITHOUT INFLICTING ANY CASUALTIES ON
GOVERNMENT TROOPS.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 10 MAY 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[HORACIO GIBEOLA] [TEXT] THE LATEST COUP ATTEMPT AGAINST GUATEMALAN
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO IS NOT AN ISOLATED EVENT.  IT SHOWS THE
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT'S PRECARIOUSNESS.  UNABLE TO MAKE GOOD
ITS LUKEWARM ELECTION PROMISES, THIS GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A COMPLETELY
DEFENSIVE POLICY.  HARASSED BY ATTEMPTED COUPS, GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION,
ADMINISTRATIVE INEPTNESS, AND INSURGENT ACTIVITIES, CEREZO'S
ADMINISTRATION IS PLAGUED BY EVIDENT INSTABILITY.  HIS GOVERNMENT IS
STILL HOSTAGE TO THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND, WHICH TEMPORARILY
SURRENDERED POWER AFTER MANY YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.

   NEVERTHELESS, CEREZO IS THE VICTIM OF MILITARY MEN WHO HAVE BEEN KEPT
AWAY FROM POSITIONS OF GREATER POWER BY THEIR FELLOW OFFICERS.  THIS SEEMS
TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE MOST RECENT PLOT AGAINST THE CIVILIAN
GOVERNMENT.  THIS PLOT, MASTERMINDED BY AIR FORCE OFFICERS, WAS CRUSHED BY
OFFICERS WHO DECIDED TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT FOR THE TIME BEING.

   GUATEMALA, 85 PERCENT OF WHOSE POPULATION LIVES IN POVERTY, IS PLAGUED BY
PARAMILITARY GROUPS THAT SPREAD PANIC, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE PEASANT AND
INDIAN POPULATION, IN COLLUSION WITH THE POWERFUL AND WELL-ARMED ARMY.
ANOTHER SIGN OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INCREASING WEAKNESS IS THAT IMPORTANT
DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND, WHICH DOMINATES KEY
ECONOMIC SECTORS.

   CEREZO'S POWER WAS THREATENED A FEW DAYS AGO BY THE DISCLOSURE THAT
GUATEMALAN FORCES FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN STAGING JOINT COUNTERINSURGENCY
OPERATIONS WITH U.S. SOLDIERS.  THIS PARTICIPATION CASTS DOUBTS ON CEREZO'S
ALLEGED ACTIVE NEUTRALITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TURNS GUATEMALA INTO JUST
ANOTHER SPRINGBOARD FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. FORCES AS PART OF THE
SO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY WAR.  ACCORDING TO THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, WAR EXERCISES ARE STAGED IN GUATEMALA WITH TROOPS FROM
THE U.S. BASES IN THE PANAMA CANAL AREA.  ON 31 JANUARY, A U.S. PILOT FLYING
A U.S. PLANE WAS KILLED WHEN HE TRIED TO LAND AT THE GUATEMALA CITY AIR
FORCE BASE.  THE REBELS ASSERTED THE PLANE WAS HIT BY ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE.  IN
ADDITION, U.S. TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED IN GUATEMALA'S CHIMALTENANGO DEPARTMENT
IN NOVEMBER 1988.

   SHORTLY AFTER THE MURDER OF 22 PEASANTS LAST FEBRUARY, THE GUERRILLAS
NOTICED FLIGHTS NEAR THE SCENE OF THE MASSACRE BY U.S.  AIR FORCE CHINOOK
HELICOPTERS THAT PARTICIPATED IN COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS OR IN MISSIONS
TO SUPPORT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY.  

   THE MOST RECENT COUP ATTEMPT IN GUATEMALA AND THE DISCOVERY OF AN
INCREASING PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS IN THAT COUNTRY HAS PLACED CEREZO'S
GOVERNMENT IN A SERIOUS, DIFFICULT POSITION.  CEREZO SEEMS TO BE FORCED TO
OBEY A SOCIETY MADE UP OF PEOPLE MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN HIM.

   LIMA, 14 MAY 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PERUVIAN POLICE TODAY ARRESTED 10
PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF HAVING DETONATED A CAR BOMB SOME 300 METERS FROM
GOVERNMENT HOUSE WHERE PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND HIS FAMILY WERE SLEEPING.

   THE POLICE REPORTED THAT THE POWERFUL SHOCK WAVE DESTROYED WINDOWS AND
DOORS IN A 400-METER RADIUS, BUT NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED.

   THE POLICE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT (MRTA).  THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT 0150 (0650 GMT) ON BLOCK NO. 3
ON ANCASH STREET, IN FRONT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO MONASTERY AND THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTE OF CULTURE.

   WITNESSES TOLD POLICE THAT THEY SAW THREE WELL-DRESSED YOUNG MEN
ADANDONING THE CAR, APPARENTLY ACTIVATING THE BOMB BY REMOTE CONTROL SOME
100 METERS AWAY.  THE SUSPECTS THEN FLED IN ANOTHER CAR THAT WAS AWATING
THEM.

   THIS IS THE SECOND CAR BOMB PLANTED BY THE MRTA SINCE 7 MAY, WHEN THE
TERRORIST GROUP BLEW UP ANOTHER VEHICLE IN FRONT OF THE SAN MARTIN MILITARY
QUARTERS, AN ARMY ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT LOCATED IN THE LIMA DISCTRICT OF
MIRAFLORES.

   THE MRTA, WHICH HAS DETONATED ABOUT 20 CAR BOMBS, BEGAN ITS ACTIVITIES IN
1984.  TWO WEEKS AGO, THE ARMY SHOT 65 MRTA MEMBERS IN A CLASH IN JAUJA, IN
THE CENTRAL MOUNTIAN REGION.

   IN RELATED DEVELOPMENTS, THE DEPARTMENTS OF PASCO, JUNIN, AND HUANUCO
RETURNED TO NORMAL TODAY AFTER A 72-HOUR "ARMED STRIKE" CALLED BY THE MAOIST
TERRORIST GROUP THE SHINING PATH.  TRADE, MINING, AND BANKING ACTIVITIES IN
THESE IMPORTANT ANDEAN DEPARTMENTS WERE COMPLETELY PARALYZED DURING THE
STRIKE.

   ONE ARMY OFFICER AND A CIVILIAN DIED, 5 POLICEMEN AND 2 CIVILIZANS WERE
INJURED, AND SOME $20 MILLION WAS LOST IN PROPERTY DAMAGE DURING THE STRIKE.

   THE MAIN PERUVIAN MINES OF LEAD, SILVER, ZINC, GOLD, AND COPPER ARE
LOCATED IN THESE THREE DEPARTMENTS. APPROXIMATELY 40,000 MINEWORKERS
OBSERVED THE STRIKE OUT OF FEAR OF SHINING PATH RETALIATION.

   ASUNCION (PARAGUAY), 16 MAY 89 (ABC COLOR) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX BY ABC COLOR REPORTERS]
[TEXT] [REPORTER] DOES YOUR PRESENCE HERE SIGNALS THE CREATION OF A
KIND OF CONTINENTAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT, SIMILAR TO THE FRONT OF MILITARY
GOVERNMENTS OF THE PAST?

   [LARCO COX] YES.  THE PRESENCE HERE OF THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE
GROUP OF 8, WITH JUST ONE EXCEPTION, WAS AGREED DURING A PREVIOUS
CONVERSATION IN WHICH WE DECIDED THAT PARAGUAY MUST BE GIVEN THE CHANCE
THAT IT DESERVES FOLLOWING THE RECENT ELECTIONS THAT REFLECTED THE WILL OF
THE PEOPLE.  AND THIS IS WHAT WE WANT, THE STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRATIC
INSTITUTIONS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT DOES ALL THAT MEAN?  

   [LARCO COX] IT MEANS THAT THE PARAGUAYAN OPPOSITION WAS ABLE TO PERFORM
ITS SUPERVISORY ROLE WITHOUT OBSTACLES, AND THAT THE PROCESS WAS OBSERVED
BY INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS, WHO MADE USE OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION TO
GUARANTEE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE PROCESS.

   [REPORTER] YOUR REMARKS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY NOW THAT THE
PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IS FIGHTING A GUERRILLA FORCE THAT JEOPARDIZES THE
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.

   [LARCO COX] RIGHT.  IN PERU WE ARE FIGHTING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  IT IS A
WELL KNOWN FACT THAT THE WORLD IS RIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS
OF THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED DURING AN ANTISUBVERSIVE ACTION.  YET THERE IS
LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO DEFEND DEMOCRACY,
WITHIN A DEMOCRACY.  DEMOCRACY MUST DEFEND ITSELF.  IN THIS CONTEXT THE
SUBJECT OF RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT WELL DEFINED.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU MEAN THAT A MILITARY GOVERNMENT IS AT TIMES MORE
EFFECTIVE?

   [LARCO COX] NO.  IT IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE FOR REPRESSION, BUT I MADE IT
CLEAR THAT SUBVERSION IN A DEMOCRACY IS UNJUSTIFIED AND THAT DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENTS DO NOT PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  IF THERE ARE ANY HUMAN
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN A DEMOCRACY, THEY STEM FROM EXCESSES BY THE REPRESSIVE
FORCES.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN THESE TYPES OF REPRESSION?

   [LARCO COX] IT IS SIMPLE.  IN A DICTATORSHIP, REPRESSION IS WIDESPREAD
AND ALMOST ALWAYS ARBITRARY, AND THERE IS NO ONE TO DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS.

   [REPORTER] IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ALAN GACIA HAS ALREADY SHOWN THAT THERE
IS A LIMIT TO WHAT A CHARISMATIC LEADER CAN DO.  IN FACT, HE IS YOUNG,
HANDSOME, AND HE IS A GOOD SPEAKER.  HOWEVER, HE COULD NOT SOLVE THE
PROBLEMS.  WHAT DOES PERU NEED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE MUCH DESIRED
STABILIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS?

   [LARCO COX] PERU NEEDS ECONOMIC STABILITY, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT
EXPERIENCE AND WITH A STRONG DESIRE TO DISTRIBUTE WEALTH.  THE
DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH WAS DONE DURING THE FIRST 2 AND 1/2 YEARS.  THE
NEGATIVE SIDE OF THIS IS THAT DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION WAS OVERSTIMULATED.
EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT SEEM CONTRADICTORY, OUR PRODUCTIVE APPARATUS NEEDED
MORE IMPORTED MATERIALS IN ORDER TO INCREASE LOCAL PRODUCTION.  THIS LED
TO A DANGEROUS DECREASE IN OUR RESERVES.  SIMULTANEOUSNLY, THE BANK
NATIONALIZATION LAW WAS SET IN MOTION.  THIS PROVIDED THE PERFECT
FRAMEWORK FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM.  THERE WAS ALSO THE EARLY
START TO THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND FINALLY THE RADICAL OPPOSITION BY THE
BUSINESS SECTOR OF A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.

   [REPORTER] THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A GROWTH IN THE CRIME RATE AND THE COSTLY
PROCESS OF FIGHTING THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND IN
URBAN TERRORIST ACTIONS.  THIS COULD EASILY LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
PERUVIAN DEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PROSPECTS, RIGHT?

   [LARCO COX] QUITO TO THE CONTRARY.  DEMOCRACY WILL BE PRESERVED EVEN IF
THE NORMAL HANDING OVER OF POWER TO THE NEW ADMINISTRATION BECOMES THE ONLY
OBJECTIVE OF THE RECENTLY INSTALLED CABINET.  THIS, HOWEVER, WILL BECOME
THE SOLE OBJECTIVE ONLY IN AN ESTREME SITUATION.  THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY OTHER
OBJECTIVES, BUT I WANT TO STRESS THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT WE ATTACH TO THE
HANDING OVER OF POWER TO THE WINNER OF CLEAN ELECTIONS, WITH GUARANTEES FOR
ALL OPPOSITION PARTIES.  THIS IS HOW THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WILL BE
PRESERVED AND THIS IS HOW THIS GOVERNMENT WILL ATTAIN ONE OF ITS MAIN
TARGETS.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 16 MAY 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] A U.S. HELICOPTER USED TO
PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE GUATEMALAN ARMY CRASHED THIS EVENING WHEN TRYING
TO LAND AT THE MILITARY AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY.  

   ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, SEVERAL PASSENGERS WERE INJURED, INCLUDING
U.S. PERSONNEL, WHO WERE TAKEN TO THE MILITARY HOSPITAL IN GUATEMALA CITY.  

   ACCORDING TO INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMY, THE U.S.
AIRCRAFT WAS BEING USED TO HELP CARRY FOOD AND SUPPLIES TO TOWNS THAT ARE
HARD TO REACH.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS SENT BY GUERRILLA GROUPS TO GUATEMALAN NEWSPAPERS --
WHICH HAVE PUBLISHED THESE REPORTS -- THESE FLIGHTS ARE ALL PART OF THE
MILITARY SUPPORT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE SUBVERSIVES.

   THERE IS NO INFORMATION YET ON THE TYPE OF AIRCRAFT INVOLVED IN THE
ACCIDENT, WHICH RESULTED WHEN "IT LOST POWER" BEFORE LANDING, ACCORDING TO
INITIAL REPORTS.  U.S. ARMY "CHINOOK" HELICOPTERS ARE USED IN GUATEMALA FOR
VARIOUS OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BETWEEN GUATEMALA CITY AND AREAS FAR DISTANT
FROM THE CAPITAL.  

   THIS IS THE FOURTH AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT OCCURRING IN RECENT MONTHS.  A
GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE (FAG) "PILATUS" AIRPLANE CRASHED SOME MONTHS AGO IN
CHIMALTENANGO PROVINCE, AND ITS PILOT DIED IN THE ACCIDENT.  A FAG
HELICOPTER RECENTLY PLUNGED INTO THE PETEN ITZA LAKE, LOCATED IN NORTHERN
GUATEMALA; TWO CREWMEN DIED AND TWO SURVIVED THE ACCIDENT.

   THE ARMY'S OFFICIAL VERSION REPORTED THAT THESE ACCIDENTS WERE CAUSED BY
BAD WEATHER OR MECHANICAL FAILURE.  GUERRILLA REPORTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN
PUBLISHED IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS, SAY THAT THE AIRCRAFT WERE SHOT DOWN BY THEIR
ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 MAY 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [EXCERPTS]
GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDO UNITS ATTACKED THE HOME OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
PRESIDENT RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO TODAY AT NOON, KILLING A
NATIONAL POLICE OFFICER GUARDING THE HOUSE.

   THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 1330 AND WAS ALLEGEDLY PERPETRATED
BY GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDO UNITS.  DURING THE ATTACK, NATIONAL POLICE
OFFICER FIDEL SANCHEZ SANCHEZ WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED.  HE WAS TAKEN TO A
MILITARY HOSPITAL BY MEMBERS OF ALVARENGA'S SECURITY POLICE.  ALVARENGA WAS
HAVING LUNCH IN HIS HOME WHEN THE POLICE OFFICERS GUARDING HIS HOME WERE
ATTACKED.

   WITNESSES HAVE REPORTED THAT FOUR YOUTHS IN A RED PICKUP TRUCK SHOT AT
THE POLICEMEN FROM A DISTANCE OF 20 METERS.  THIS LED TO AN EXCHANGE OF
GUNFIRE, ALARMING RESIDENTS IN THE COLONIA MIRAMONTES AREA.

   ALVARENGA ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] OF
BEING DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK.  HE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO THE
FACT THAT HE IS OPPOSED TO ALLOWING 100 HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.  ALVARENGA ADDED THAT THE INSURGENTS' ATTITUDE HAS DEFINITELY
CLOSED THE DOOR ON THE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT THIS EVACUATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALVARENGA] IT CANNOT BE.  TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, I
INSIST THAT THESE HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  IF
THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, ALL OF THEM, AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER ALLOW THESE
HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS TO LEAVE, THEN WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING AGAINST THAT
TYPE OF ACTION.  WHY NOT TAKE THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN MAIMED OUT OF THE
COUNTRY?  SO MANY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MAIMED BY BOMBS!  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
AT LEAST ONE SALVADORAN CHILD BE TAKEN TO A LARGE HOSPITAL IN GERMANY.  

   IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GO TO SUCH EXTREMES.  AM I MAKING MYSELF CLEAR?
TELL ME, HOW CAN WE SPEAK OF HUMANITARIAN ACTS WHEN OUR SALVADORAN CHILDREN,
OUR YOUTH ARE BEING MAIMED?  I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I CANNOT ASSURE YOU
THAT WE WILL PREVENT GUERRILLA COERCIVE ACTIONS.  THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
CANNOT PREVENT THIS.  WHAT WE CAN DO IS LEGISLATE.  WE NEED TO LEGISLATE A
BIT MORE TO GIVE OUR PEOPLE SECURITY.  IF THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE FMLN
AND, FOR THIS REASON, IT HAS ELEMENTS IT WISHES TO DESTROY... [CHANGES
THOUGHT] LOOK, THEY CAN DESTROY ME.  THIS IS TRUE.  I DO NOT WANT IT TO
HAPPEN, BUT THEY CAN DESTROY ME.  BUT OTHERS LIKE RICARDO ALVARENGA WILL COME
FORWARD. [END RECORDING]

   THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE ON BERNAL AVENUE IN COLONIA MIRAMONTES, A FEW
MINUTES AFTER ALVARENGA ENTERED HIS HOME.  ALVARENGA SUFFERED NO INJURIES.
THE FMLN HAS NOT YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] THE
GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] STATES:

   1.  BY REJECTING OUR PROPOSAL AIMED AT TRANSFORMING THE ELECTIONS INTO A
PATH TO ACHIEVE PEACE, THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] TURNED
THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS INTO A PROCESS OF WAR.

   2.  ARENA WILL ESTABLISH A GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED ONLY BY THE VOTES OF A
MERE 18 PERCENT OF VOTING-AGE SALVADORANS, WHICH MAKES IT AN ILLEGITIMATE
GOVERNMENT AND A GOVERNMENT OF MINORITIES FOR MINORITIES.

   3.  EVER SINCE ELECTION RESULTS WERE REVEALED, THERE HAS BEEN A
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE FORM OF
ARRESTS, MURDERS, SEARCHES, RAIDS ON LABOR AND ASSOCIATION OFFICES, ATTACKS
AGAINST UNIVERSITIES, AND SO ON.

   4.  ARENA IS ALREADY ANNOUNCING, AND IN MANY CASES ALREADY IMPLEMENTING,
ANTIPOPULAR MEASURES SUCH AS THE FORMATION OF DEATH SQUADS UNDER THE NAME OF
PATRIOTIC CIVILIAN DEFENSE, THE ANNULMENT OF DECREE 207, DEVALUATION OF THE
CURRENCY, PRIVATIZATIONS, ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE OF SIEGE, AND OTHER
MEASURES THAT WILL HURT THE PEOPLE.

   5.  ARENA'S POLICY TOWARD THE EVACUATION OF PEOPLE MAIMED IN WAR SHOWS
THAT THE ARENA GOVERNMENT WILL FURTHER DEHUMANIZE THE WAR.

   6.  AS A FIRST REPLY OF OUR FRONT TO THE ARENA GOVERNMENT, THE GENERAL
COMMAND DECREES A NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE BEGINNING AT DAWN ON 31
MAY.  THE MEASURE MUST BE COMPLIED WITH ON ALL HIGHWAYS OF THE COUNTRY AND
IN THE CITIES.  WE URGE ALL OUR UNITS TO ENFORCE THIS DECREE AND OUR PEOPLE
TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE STOPPAGE TO REPUDIATE THE DEATH SQUAD'S
GOVERNMENT AT THE VERY MOMENT OF ITS INAUGURATION.

PEOPLE.  THROUGHOUT THESE MANY YEARS OF WAR, HUNDREDS OF COUNTRYMEN
HAVE SPILLED THEIR BLOOD FOR THE LAND ON WHICH THEY TOIL TO ACHIEVE
JUSTICE, DEMOCRACY, AND BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS FOR THE PEOPLE.
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE'S MOST HEARTFELT DESIRES.  IN THE STRUGGLE
AGAINST THE ENEMY, WE HAVE COMMITTED ERRORS IN MILITARY PROCEDURES
THAT HAVE RESULTED IN CASUALTIES AMONG THE PEOPLE.  TO QUICKLY AND
RADICALLY CORRECT THESE REGRETTABLE PROCEDURAL ERRORS, THE FARBUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] GENERAL COMMAND ORDERS ALL
COMMANDERS AND COMBATANTS OF OUR MILITARY UNITS TO STUDY AND IMPLEMENT
THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS, WHICH MUST BE STRICTLY FULFILLED:

   1.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE MUST POPULATED AREAS BE MINED.  MINES MUST BE
PLACED WHERE ENEMY TROOPS TRAVEL.  ALL PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN IN HIGHWAY
AMBUSHES SO THE MINES WILL ONLY AFFECT ENEMY PATROLS AND TRANSPORT VEHICLES.

   2.  IN THE PLANS TO ATTACK ENEMY GARRISONS, THE COMMANDERS MUST ALWAYS
EVALUATE THE CIVILIAN POPULATION'S SITUATION.  EVERY EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO
CARRY OUT CLEAN ATTACKS.  IF THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY, EVEN AFTER ALL
ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN EXPLORED, THAT PERSONS HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
ENEMY WOULD BE AFFECTED IF THE ATTACK IS CARRIED OUT, THE OPERATION MUST BE
SUSPENDED.

   3.  BEFORE PUNISHING THE OWNERS OF PRIVATE VEHICLES AND BUSES WHO VIOLATE
THE PROVISIONS OF THE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, OUR UNITS MUST BE ABSOLUTELY
SURE THE OWNER VIOLATED THE PROVISION.

   4.  IN CARRYING OUT SABOTAGE OPERATIONS, IT MUST BE CONSIDERED WHO WOULD
BE AFFECTED BY THE ACTION.  TO THE SAME EXTENT OUR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS MUST
BE IMPLACABLE WITH THE REGIME AND THE OLIGARCHY, THOSE OPERATIONS MUST NOT
AFFECT WORKERS, SMALL OWNERS, PEASANTS, OR THE LOWER CLASSES.

   5.  BEFORE CARRYING OUT EXECUTIONS, AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION MUST BE
CONDUCTED UNTIL IT IS CONFIRMED THAT THE TARGET OF THE OPERATION IS AN ENEMY
OF THE PEOPLE.

   6.  ALL OUR MILITARY OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE EXECUTIONS, MUST BE
PUBLICLY RECOGNIZED SO AS TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH THE ENEMY'S DIRTY WAR
PROCEDURES.

   EVERY FMLN COMBATANT MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE
PEOPLE AND THAT OUR STRUGGLE IS OF THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE. THEREFORE,
WE MUST ACT CONSISTENT WITH THIS REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLE.

   LA PAZ, 26 MAY 89 (LA RED PANAMERICANA) -- [TEXT] INTERIOR MINISTER
EDUARDO PEREZ BELTRAN HAS DISCARDED THE POSSIBILITY OF A NEW, QUOTE,
TERRORIST OR GUERRILLA GROUP, UNQUOTE, OUTBREAK IN THE COUNTRY. HE
MADE THIS STATEMENT REFERRING TO THE MURDER OF TWO U.S. MISSIONARIES
LAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

   TO REMIND THE PEOPLE OF THIS CASE, DURING THE EVENING OF 24 MAY TWO U.S.
CITIZENS, WHO BELONGED TO A RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION, WERE MURDERED BY A
SELF-STYLED ZARATE WILKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION [FAL] GROUP IN DOWNTOWN
LA PAZ.

   THE INTERIOR MINISTER ADDED THAT THIS ALLEGED ORGANIZATION THAT CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER, HAS NO TIES WITH THE PERUVIAN SHINING PATH
TERRORIST GROUP.  

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PEREZ BELTRAN] TO THIS MOMENT, AND DUE TO THE
SERIOUSNESS OF THE CASE, I DO NOT DARE TO ADMIT THE EXISTANCE OF ANY
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO TERRORIST GROUPS. IF THE SHINING PATH IS
OPERATING IN BOLIVIA, IT SHOULD ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS IN FACT SHINING PATH
THAT IS COMMITTING THESE CRIMES.

   WE CAN SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY IN THE
1960'S, WHEN IT DID NOT HIDE ITS IDENTITY. THIS WAS AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP.
THEY ARRIVED IN BOLIVIA WITHOUT HIDING THEIR INTERNATIONAL IDENTITY, AND
THERE ARE MANY BOLIVIANS WHO CAN TELL US ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY.

   NOW, IF THIS CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE SHINING PATH, THEN IT WAS
COMMITTED BY THE SHINING PATH AND NOT BY THE ZARATE WILKA GROUP. I DO NOT
WANT TO DISCARD THIS POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER, I DO NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT AS
SOMETHING VERIFIED AND CONFIRMED. OUR OBLIGATION, AS MEMBERS OF THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, IS TO RELEASE THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING OBVIOUS, FULLY
VERIFIED AND CONFIRMED. [END RECORDING]

   THE INTERIOR MINISTER ADDED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE SELF-STYLED
FAL-ZARATE WILKA GROUP AND OF SHINING PATH MEMBERS IN BOLIVIA IS DOUBTFUL,
BECAUSE IN THE CRIMINAL CASES RECORDED IN COCHABAMBA AND IN ORURO RECENTLY,
THE POLICE DISCOVERED THAT COMMON CRIMINALS, AND ESPECIALLY THOSE LINKED TO
THE WORLD OF DRUG ADDITION AND DRUG TRAFFICKING WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN
THOSE CRIMES.

   REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE TWO MISSIONARIES IN LA PAZ LAST WEDNESDAY,
THE INTERIOR MINISTER STATED THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN DETAINED, BUT THAT THE
INVESTIGATIONS BY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES CONTINUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT] 

   [PEREZ BELTRAN] NO. WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THE EXISTENCE OF A TERRORIST
GROUP IN BOLIVIA.  

   [REPORTER] AND WHAT ABOUT THESE MURDER CASES?

   [PEREZ BELTRAN] I DO NOT KNOW. MANY PEOPLE CAN BE HIDING BEHIND THIS
ZARATE WILKA GROUP. WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ZARATE WILKA GROUP.
WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR POLITICAL LEANINGS, OR WHAT PARTY IS
BEHIND THIS GROUP. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A COMMON CRIME, OR MAYBE NOT.

   BUT WE CANNOT JUST GO OUT AND SAY: YES, THIS GROUP LAST NIGHT
MACHINEGUNNED THESE PEOPLE, THAT THEY ESCAPED, ETC. THIS WOULD MEAN A VERY
IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WANTS TO DEAL WITH THIS CASE AS
SERIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT CAUSE THE PEOPLE TO PANIC.

   WE MUST DO SOMETHING FOR THE COUNTRY. WE SHOULD UNITE OUR FORCES, ALL
COALITION PARTIES, THE RULING PARTY, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THE ARMED FORCES,
THE NATIONAL POLICE, AND ALL BOLIVIANS, TO DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS WOULD
REPRESENT A REAL BOLIVIAN STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE WHO INTEND TO DISRUPT OUR
PROCESS OF LIBERTY, TO FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OF THE
FATHERLAND. [END RECORDING]

MURDER BECAUSE THEY CONSIDERED AN ANTI-U.S. ACTION.  

   ACCORDING TO SOME POLITICAL REACTIONS, THIS CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE
SELF-STYLED ZARATE-WILKA GROUP, SHOWS THAT THERE ARE ARMED GROUPS OPERATING
IN BOLIVIA.  

   LESS THAN 40 HOURS AFTER THE MURDER OF THE TWO MORMON MISSIONARIES BY AN

   TEGUCIGALPA, 29 MAY 89 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES
TODAY CONFIRMED THAT HEAVY CLASHES TOOK PLACE BETWEEN HONDURAN AND
SALVADORAN TROOPS OVER THE WEEKEND.  ACCORDING TO A LOCAL RADIO STATION,
BOTH HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS WERE KILLED.  

   JUAN SIERRA, A HONDURAN ARMED FORCES SOURCE, TOLD REUTER: "WE ARE CERTAIN
THERE WERE CLASHES, BUT THE DETAILS WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER."

   THE HONDURAN RADIO STATION RADIO AMERICA, QUOTING A FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SOURCE, SAID AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF
CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS WERE KILLED WHEN SALVADORAN TROOPS ENTERED HONDURAN
TERRITORY ON SATURDAY.  

   THE FMLN, QUOTED BY RADIO AMERICA, SAID THE FIGHTING IN THE HONDURAN
DEPARTMENT OF INTIBUCA, ON THE PLAINS NEAR THE SALVADORAN BORDER, LASTED 4
HOURS.  DURING THE FIGHTING, A SALVADORAN HELICOPTER BOMBED HONDURAN
CIVILIANS, KILLING OR WOUNDING A NUMBER OF THEM, THE FMLN SAID.

   RADIO AMERICA SAID:  "WE DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF DEAD AND
WOUNDED.  (THE FMLN) ONLY SAID IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT CIVILIANS WERE KILLED
OR WOUNDED IN THE CLASH."  

   THE TROOPS OF BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY CLASHED AT THE BORDER AS THE
RESULT OF TENSION CAUSED BY TERRITORIAL DISPUTES AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE
PRESENCE OF LARGE CONTINGENTS OF SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS NEAR THE BORDER.  THE
TWO ARMIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY HELD JOINT ANTIGUERRILLA OPERATIONS.  ON ONE
OCCASION, SALVADORAN SOLDIERS ATTACKED HONDURAN TROOPS, MISTAKING THEM FOR
REBELS.  

   THE TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES REACHED ITS PEAK DURING THE
SO-CALLED SOCCER WAR IN 1969, WHEN THE TWO COUNTRIES FOUGHT FOR 100 HOURS
OVER A TERRITORIAL DISPUTE.

   CLANDESTINE, 28 MAY 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] AT 1400 ON 27 MAY,
SPECIAL HONDURAN TROOPS ENTERED SAN ANDRES AND TIERRA AGRIA, SAN
GERARDO JURISDICTION, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, WHEN ARCE BATTALION
TROOPS WERE CARRYING OUT AN OPERATION IN THE AREA.  THEY CLASHED NEAR
EL CHENGUE HILL AND ALONG THE SHORES OF TOROLA RIVER.  DURING THIS
CLASH, WHICH LASTED 4 HOURS, ARCE BATTALION WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO
ROCKET-FIRING HELICOPTERS, A HUGHES 500, AND A A-37 PLANE.

   SALVADORAN TROOPS SUSTAINED NUMEROUS CASUALTIES, INCLUDING A WOUNDED ARCE
BATTALION OFFICER.  HONDURAN TROOPS WERE PUSHED BACK AND CORNERED IN LOS
LLANITOS, SANTA LUCIA JURISDICTION, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, HONDURAS.  ARCE
BATTALION LANDED TROOPS FROM FOUR HELICOPTERS IN THAT VILLAGE.  AN HONDURAN
HELICOPTER, WHICH WAS EVACUATING CASUALTIES, WAS ATTACKED AND PURSUED 7 KM
INTO HONDURAN TERRITORY BY A SALVADORAN HELICOPTER, WHICH FIRED ROCKETS AND
MACHINEGUNS.

   ARCE BATTALION, WHICH SURROUNDED HONDURAN TROOPS IN LOS LLANITOS,
CAPTURED AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF PRISONERS.  IN THIS CLASH, RESIDENTS OF
THE SAN ANDRES, [WORDS INDISTINCT] CANTONS, AND RESIDENTS OF LOS CASTANOS,
LOS LLANITOS, AND LA CEIBITA WERE ROCKETED AND MACHINEGUNNED BY SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS.  

   THERE ARE REPORTS ABOUT PARTIALLY DESTROYED HOMES AND ANIMALS THAT WERE
KILLED.  WE ARE TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THE NAMES OF THE WOUNDED AND DEAD
AMONG AREA RESIDENTS.

   WE URGE THE HONDURAN PEOPLE TO REFLECT ON THE SERIOUSNESS AND
REPERCUSSIONS OF THESE CLASHES.  THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE HONDURAN ARMY'S
POLICY OF INVOLVMENT IN THE SALVADORAN WAR.  

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAD WARNED THAT
HONDURAN TROOPS' COOPERATION AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE SALVADORAN WAR,
FOLLOWING A U.S. DECISION, WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A CLASH BETWEEN THE TWO
ARMIES.  IT IS A SECRET TO NOBODY THAT THE OLIGARCHS WHO HAVE REACHED POWER
WITH THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT ARE THE SAME ONES WHO
PROMOTED THE INVASION OF HONDURAS IN 1969 AND THAT THE OFFICERS WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE AT THE TIME FOR MASSACRES, RAIDS, AND ABUSES AGAINST THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE IN THE HIERARCHY OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMY.  

   WE BELIEVE HONDURANS MUST THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION, BECAUSE THIS LEVEL
OF CONFRONTATION WITH INFANTRY TROOPS AND AIRCRAFT WILL SET THE TONE OF THE
CONFLICT FOR THE DEFINITION OF THE BORDER CONFLICT OF A GOVERNMENT OF
OLIGARCHS WHO HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED AN EXPANSIONIST POLICY TOWARD HONDURAS.  

   ONCE AGAIN, WE CALL ON THE HONDURAN PEOPLE TO STOP THEIR ARMY'S
INVOLVEMENT IN SOMEONE ELSE'S WAR [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN EL SALVADOR, ITS
MAIN ENEMY.  

   WE CALL ON THE NATIONAL AND INTERNAL PRESS, ESPECIALLY HONDURAN MEDIA, TO
VISIT LOS LLANITOS, SANTA LUCIA, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, TO CONFIRM THESE
SERIOUS INCIDENTS.  WE CALL ON HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP THE
INJURED CIVILIANS.

THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN IS ACHIEVED.  DURING THE OAXTEPEC MEETING, THE
POLITICAL PARTIES ESTABLISHED THE NEED TO CONTINUE THE TALKS PAST 19 MARCH.
THE FMLN DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE NOW TO REAFFIRM THIS NEED AND TO BEGIN TALKS
AT A MUTUALLY AGREED ON PLACE AND DATE.  DURING THESE MEETINGS BETWEEN THE
OPPOSITION PARTIES THE FMLN, WE WOULD PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING PLATFORM OF
COMMITMENTS WE FEEL THE FMLN AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT MUST ACCEPT AS MEASURES
CONDUCIVE TOWARD CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR A DIALOGUE AND DIRECT
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SIDES:

   2.  POLITICAL COMMITMENTS OF THE FMLN:  

   A.  TO ABSTAIN FROM ANY FORM OF ATTACK AGAINST POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE

SABOTAGE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

   C.  TO RESPECT THE LIVES, FREEDOM, AND WELL-BEING OF RELATIVES OF
POLITICAL LEADERS AND OFFICERS IN THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THE ARMED FORCES AND
TO RESPECT THEIR RESIDENCES.

   D.  TO CONTINUE TO REFRAIN FROM USING ARTILLERY-EQUIPPED PLATFORMS, KNOW
AS CAR BOMBS.  

   E.  TO RESPECT U.S. PERSONNEL AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN EL SALVADOR.  

   F.  TO SUSPEND SABOTAGE OF URBAN POWER POLES AND SHOPPING CENTERS.

ACCORDING TO AN ACAN DISPATCH, THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES HAVE REPORTED
THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY CHASED REBELS ON LAND AND FROM THE AIR INTO
HONDURAN TERRITORY.  ACTING HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO
CACERES YESTERDAY SENT SALVADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER RICARDO ACEVEDO A
PROTEST NOTE OVER THE ARMED CONFRONTATION BETWEEN SALVADORAN AND
HONDURAN FORCES.

   ACCORDING TO THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], AN
UNIDENTIFIED ARCE COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION OFFICER WAS KILLED IN A
CLASH WITH SALVADORAN TROOPS THAT HAD ENTERED HONDURAN TERRITORY.  THE
REBELS ADDED THAT FOUR SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS LANDED AT LOS
LLANITOS, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, IN HONDURAS, CHASED AND CORNERED HONDURAN
SOLDIERS, AND TOOK SEVERAL OF THEM PRISONER.

   SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE SAID THAT THE
GUERRILLAS ARE TRYING TO PIT ONE ARMY AGAINST THE OTHER BY DISTORTING THE
REPORT ON THE INCIDENT.  THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT
THE GUERRILLAS' STRONGHOLDS ARE IN THE SALVADORAN REFUGEES CAMPS AND THAT
THEY CONSTANTLY ENTER HONDURAN TERRITORY TO REST OR TO REPLENISH THEIR ARMS
AND AMMUNITION SUPPLIES.  IN 1969, HONDURAS AND EL SALVADOR STAGED A
100-HOUR WAR AS THE RESULT OF A BORDER DISPUTE INVOLVING A 450 - SQ KM AREA
INCLUDING SEVERAL ISLANDS IN THE FONSECA GULF, THE ACAN DISPATCH NOTED.

[ALVARO AYALA] [TEXT] TERRORISM SEEMS NOT TO HAVE LET UP THROUGHOUT
COLOMBIA.  BOGOTA, CALI, AND MEDELLIN HAVE BEEN THE TARGETS OF
DYNAMITE ATTACKS. LAST NIGHT, WHILE THE COUNTRY WAS STILL IN SHOCK
OVER THE ATTACK AGAINST DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY]
DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL ALFREDO MAZA MARQUEZ, A SHOPPING MALL IN

   LA PAZ, 26 MAY 89 (PRESENCIA) -- [EXCERPTS] INTERIOR MINISTER
EDUARDO PEREZ BELTRAN HAS BLAMED THE MURDER OF TWO U.S. MORMON
MISSIONARIES ON NARCOTERRORISTS, WHO WANT TO GIVE IT A POLITICAL
CONNOTATION.  "DRUG TRAFFICKERS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THIS CRIME, AND
THEY WANT TO GIVE IT POLITICAL CONNOTATIONS," PEREZ SAID.

   PEREZ SAID THAT THE MRUDER OF THE TWO MISSIONARIES MIGHT BE A "COPYCAT
MURDER" DONE WITH THE INTENTION OF BLAMING THE "ZARATE WILKA GROUP WITH
HAVING DONE IT."  HE ADDED THAT THE GROUP IS NAMED AFTER A PEASANT LEADER
WHO LIVED EARLY THIS CENTURY.  THE PEASANT HAD NO POLITICAL AFFILIATION
WHATSOEVER. THIS IS WHY WE CAN NOT SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT
GUERRILLA GROUPS ARE OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   THE FAL-ZARATE WILKA GROUP, WHICH CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME,
LEFT A HANDWRITTEN MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT THEIR WAR IS TO KILL "THE
YANKEE INVADERS WHO COME HERE TO MASSACRE OUR PEASANT BROTHERS."

   REFERRING TO THE MESSAGE LEFT AT THE SCENE, THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID
THAT AN INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE MESSAGE REVEALS THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IN
LANGUAGUE NOT COMMONLY USED BY A LEFTIST POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.  THE
MESSAGE IS VAGUE WHEN IT REFERS TO BOTH NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND THE
EXPLOITATION OF PEASANTS.  THIS IS A CRIME IN WHICH DRUG TRAFFICKERS MIGHT
BE INVOLVED AND TO WHICH THEY WANT TO ATTACH A POLITICAL CONNOTATION," PEREZ
SAID.

   PEREZ ADDED THAT IN RECENT DAYS "THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS THAT MEMBERS OF
THE U.S. ARMED FORCES HAVE COME TO BOLIVIA WITH PLANS TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  WE HAVE TO REJECT THOSE RUMORS."

   HE SAID THAT THIS CRIME IS IN NO WAY LINKED TO THE PRESENCE OF "SHINING
PATH" TERRORISTS IN BOLIVIA.  HE SAID: "IF THIS TERRORIST GROUP IS OPERATING
IN BOLIVIA, IT SHOULD HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME, LIKE THE
NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN) DID IN THE 1960'S WHEN THEY REVEALED THAT
THEY CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES ABROAD."

   PEREZ STATED THAT MURDER OF THE U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES SHOULD BE
SERIUSLY ANALYZED SO THAT A RELIABLE REPORT IS RELEASED.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 2 JUN 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] GENERAL COMMAND HAS AGREED TO
"CONTINUE" THE DIALOGUE WITH THE NEW SALAVADORAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS
SWORN IN YESTERDAY.  THE FMLN ALSO PROPOSES CHANNELS TO FOLLOW FOR
STARTING THE DIALOGUE.

   SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI OF THE RIGHT-WING NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) YESTERDAY PROPOSED TO THE GUERRILLAS THAT THEY
BEGIN A DIALOGUE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION THAT WILL END THE ARMED
CONFLICT IN THAT NATION.

   A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION "CAN LEAD TO PEACE IN EL SALVADOR," THE FMLN
ASSERTED IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED TODAY IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, AND SIGNED BY
COMMANDERS FRANCISCO JOVEL, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN,
EDUARDO SANCHO, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS.  

   THE FMLN PROPOSES "COORDINATING A CEASE-FIRE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN
OVERALL NEGOTIATION OF THE CONFLICT," WITHOUT TRYING TO "APPLY THE SAME
MEANS USED IN THE CASE OF THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS."

   IN EXCHANGE, THE REBELS DEMAND "THE TRIAL OF FORMER MAJOR ROBERTO
D'AUBUISSON AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S MURDER,"
AS WELL AS "THE COMPLETE EXCLUSION" OF D'AUBUISSON FROM ANY GOVERNMENT
POSITION.  D'AUBUISSON, WHO HAS DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE SALVADORAN
ARCHBISHOP'S ASSASSINATION, FOUNDED ARENA, WHICH WON THE 19 MARCH
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   THE GUERRILLAS DEMAND "THE DISBANDMENT OF THE DEATH SQUADS." THEY ALSO
WANT THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO PROCEED WITH THE CREATION OF THE PATRIOTIC CIVIL
DEFENSE GROUPS.  THE REBELS REQUEST "THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE" OF LABOR
LEADERS, MASS MOVEMENT ACTIVISTS, AND DETAINED POLITICAL PRISONERS, AND THEY
DEMAND THAT MURDERS, KIDNAPPINGS, AND ALL OTHER FORMS OF REPRESSION AGAINST
THE OPPOSITION PARTIES CEASE.

   THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE REBELS ARE WILLING TO AGREE TO A
CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT "WHEN IT IS AGREED UPON AND IMPLEMENTED UNDER
INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION," AS WELL AS TO A MULTILATERAL CUTBACK OF MILITARY
SUPPLIES "OF ANY KIND TO ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS AND GROUPS
INVOLVED IN A CONFLICT."

   THE FMLN COMMAND PLEDGES THAT ONCE THE DIALOGUE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, IT
WILL "REFRAIN FROM ATTACKING POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT"
AND FROM ENFORCING NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGES.  THE FMLN OFFERS TO
"RESPECT THE LIVES AND LIBERTY" OF POLITICAL AND MILITARY LEADERS'
RELATIVES, AS WELL AS TO "SUSPEND" THE USE OF CAR BOMBS IN THE CITIES.  

   THE GUERRILLAS ALSO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO RESPECTING "U.S.  PERSONNEL AND
INSTALLATIONS IN EL SALVADOR" AND TO SUSPENDING ATTACKS ON THE ELECTRICAL
SYSTEM AND ON URBAN SHOPPING CENTERS.

   DURING THE FIRST PHASE OF TALKS, THE GUERRILLAS POINT OUT, THE POLITICAL
PARTIES NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA)
GOVERNMENT COULD PROMOTE AND ARRANGE THE DIALOGUE UNTIL "A DIRECT
NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN" IN PLACES AND ON DATES
"MUTUALLY AGREED UPON" IS ACHIEVED.

   THE INSURGENT LEADERSHIP WARNS THAT IF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN BOTH PARTIES
DOES NOT TAKE PLACE, THE INAUGURATION OF THE ARENA GOVERNMENT WILL MEAN "THE
HEIGHTENING AND PROLONGATION OF THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR."  

   THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE ALSO PROPOSES THAT AGRARIAN REFORM BE CONTINUED.  THE
REBELS ALSO WANT THE NATIONALIZATION OF BANKING AND OF FOREIGN TRADE,
UNRESTRICTED FREEDOM OF INFORMATION, AND RESPECT FOR THE COMMITMENT MADE BY
THE DUARTE ADMINISTRATION TO "EVACUATE THE WOUNDED AND MAIMED GUERRILLAS"
AND TO RESPECT THE LIVES OF RELATIVES OF THE LEADERS OF MASS MOVEMENTS,
OPPOSITION PARTIES, AND THE FMLN.

ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH.  IT BELIEVES VIOLENCE WILL NOT SOLVE THE
COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS, IS NOT THE WAY TO SETTLE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES,
AND WILL NOT LEAD TO PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT.

   WE HOPE THIS CONDEMNABLE ACT WILL NOT BE FOLLOWED BY AN ESCALATION OF
VIOLENCE AND REVENGE THAT WOULD ONLY SERVE TO FURTHER POLARIZE SALVADORAN
SOCIETY.  THE PDC EXPRESSES ITS CONDOLENCES TO THE REPUBLIC'S GOVERNMENT,
THAT IS, THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, AND RODRIGUEZ' GRIEVING
FAMILY.  WE URGE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BASED ON MUTUAL RESPECT, TO FIND A
POLITICAL AND PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS THAT IS CURRENTLY AFFLICTING
OUR SOCIETY.  THIS IS THE PDC'S POSITION ON THE CONDEMNABLE ASSASSINATION OF
DR ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH.

   [LOPEZ] DR COLINDRES, DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THIS COULD LEAD TO AN ESCALATION
OF VIOLENCE BY THE EXTREME RIGHT?

   [COLINDRES] WE HOPE REASON WILL PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THIS
OR ANY OTHER INCIDENT SHOULD NOT LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, BECAUSE
THAT WOULD ONLY RESULT IN MORE BLOODLETTING AMONG THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  I
BELIEVE WE MUST NOT FALL FOR THE TRAP OF VIOLENCE THAT WOULD ONLY DESTROY US.

   [LOPEZ] IT IS PRESUMED THAT THIS ACTION INVOLVED LEFTIST URBAN COMMANDOS
OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT POLITICAL GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE?

   [COLINDRES] LET US WAIT AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE
BEEN THE FMLN OR ULTRARIGHTIST FACTIONS SEEKING FURTHER POLARIZATION AND
BLOODLETTING.  WE DO NOT WANT TO PASS JUDGMENT YET.  REGARDLESS OF WHO DID
IT, THIS IS AN ASSASSINATION, WHICH IS NOT THE PROPER WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
AMONG SALVADORANS.  

   [LOPEZ] IN THE PDC'S OPINION, WHAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF THE ARMED FORCES
IN THE WAKE OF DR RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S ASSASSINATION?  

   [COLINDRES] I BELIEVE THE ARMED FORCES MUST CONTINUE THEIR POLICY OF
PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, BECAUSE THIS IMPLIES
RESPECTING THE LAW AND STRENGTHENING THE INSTITUTION OF THE ARMED FORCES.
THEY HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY AND CALM OF THE
ENTIRE POPULATION.

   [LOPEZ] WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING?  

   [COLINDRES] ONLY THAT WE HOPE THIS KIND OF REGRETTABLE AND CONDEMNABLE
INCIDENT WILL NOT BE REPEATED.  WE ALSO HOPE THAT VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION
AMONG SALVADORAN BROTHERS WILL END ONCE AND FOR ALL. [END RECORDING]

   SAN PEDRO SULA, 9 JUN 89 (TIEMPO) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] WHEN WE
ASKED THE FOREIGN MINISTRY WHY THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT
PROTESTED THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ATTACKS ON HONDURAN ARMY
SOLDIERS AND A HELICOPTER IN LOS LLANITOS (INTIBUCA), THE ANSWER WAS
VERY SIMPLE, BUT IT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE THAT IS GIVEN TO NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY: THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT INFORMED US OF
ANYTHING AT ALL -- THEY SAID -- AND WHAT THE MEDIA SAYS IS NOT
ACCURATE.

   THE NEWSPAPERS TIEMPO AND LA PRENSA PUBLISHED REPORTS OF THE INCIDENT
WITH PHOTOGRAPHS THAT CONFIRMED THE AGGRESSION, THE BOMBING AND SHELLING OF
VILLAGES IN OUR TERRITORY, AND PROVIDED ACCOUNTS BY EYEWITNESSES AND
MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES, BUT WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, LACK
CREDIBILITY OR IMPORTANCE.

   LATER FOREIGN NEWSMEN WENT TO THESE PLACES AND CONFIRMED WHAT TIEMPO AND
LA PRENSA HAD REPORTED.  THEY ALSO OBTAINED OTHER DETAILS ON THE INCIDENTS.
WHILE THE HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES DENIED THE INCIDENT, DESPITE
THE EVIDENCE, THE TRUTH IS THERE FOR THE GENTLEMEN OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY
TO SEE.

   ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS BY THE VILLAGERS WHO WERE THE VICTIMS OF THE
SALVADORAN AGGRESSION, THE HONDURAN MILITARY THREATENED THEM AND ORDERED
THEM TO BE SILENT OR TO LIE ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  IT WAS NECESSARY FOR
THE SANTA LUCIA MAYOR TO INTERVENE BEFORE THEY COULD TELL NEWSMEN WHAT HAD
HAPPENED.  A REPORTER FOR LA PRENSA WAS SIDETRACKED BY A COMMANDER, NO DOUBT
TO KEEP HIM FROM DOING HIS JOB AS A JOURNALIST.

   THE HONDURAN ARMY'S WEAPONS SERVED TO KEEP THE AGGRESSION QUIET INSTEAD
OF REPELLING IT, TO THREATEN HONDURAN BORDER VILLAGERS INSTEAD OF
PROTECTING THEM, WHILE THE ARMY TURNED ITS BACK ON THE ENEMY ARMED FORCES
-- WHICH HAVE TRAMPLED ON OUR TERRITORY AND HUMILIATED US -- INSTEAD OF
FIGHTING THEM.  IN SHORT, THE WEAPONS THAT WE HONDURANS AND THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE OBTAINED WITH SO MUCH SACRIFICE, EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF GOING
WITHOUT FOOD AND MEDICINE, ARE USED AGAINST HONDURAS AND ITS PEOPLE.  

   THIS SITUATION SHOULD CAUSE US TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THE EXISTENCE OF
THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES.  WE ANTICIPATED THIS WHEN THE REGIONAL MILITARY
TRAINING AND SECURITY CENTER (CREMS) WAS CREATED EXCLUSIVELY TO TRAIN 10,000
SALVADORAN TROOPS -- THE SAME ARMY THAT INVADED US IN 1969 AND THAT IS
ATTACKING US AGAIN.

   WE WONDER IF WE ARE NOT ACQUIRING A MERCENARY MENTALITY IN HONDURAS,
WHEREBY THE STATE'S WEAPONS GO TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER RATHER THAN BEING USED
IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST.  FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN USED FOR
ECONOMIC -- THOUGH IDEOLOGICALLY DISGUISED -- BENEFITS.

   NO NATIONAL MILITARY FORCE CAN FUNCTION LIKE THIS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
IN ANY EVENT, THE IDEOLOGY OF ANY ARMY SHOULD BE NATIONALISTIC, EVEN IN THE
CASE OF POWERS AND SUPERPOWERS THAT INVENT AND USE INTERNATIONALIST
IDEOLOGIES FOR THEIR HEGEMONIC STRUGGLES.

   HERE IN HONDURAS THE CASE OF THE ARMED FORCES IS JUST THE OPPOSITE.  TO
THE MILITARY INSTITUTE'S WAY OF THINKING, THOSE WHO ARE DEMANDING THE
DEFENSE OF SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY ARE SUBVERSIVES WHO ARE
ALLIED WITH SUBVERSIVES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  AN AGGRESSION AGAINST
HONDURAS BY A FOREIGN ARMY IS LEGITIMIZED BY THE PEOPLE ATTACKED AND THOSE
WHO INFORM AND PROTEST ARE ENEMIES OF THE FATHERLAND.

   THIS WAS STATED IN AN EDITORIAL OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' "MILITARY
PROJECTIONS" PROGRAM.  THE EDITORIAL SAID THAT THE REPORT WAS ISSUED
"WITHOUT PRIOR INVESTIGATION" AND WAS BASED SOLELY "ON INFORMATION PROVIDED
BY THESE GROUPS TO CONFUSE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION."

   "THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF SOME PRINT AND BROADCAST MEDIA DIRECTORS HAS
REACHED THE POINT THAT THEY ARE PROMOTING THESE CLEARLY MARXIST - LENINIST
SUBVERSIVES, FINANCED BY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, AND THOSE WHO DO NOT HIDE THEIR
OPEN SYMPATHY WITH PSEUDO-PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS.  THEY ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL
THIS BY CLAIMING THAT RADIO STATIONS OR NEWSPAPERS HAVE UNRESTRICTED FREEDOM
OF EXPRESSION."

   A SIMILAR EXPLANATION WAS PRESENTED BY THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY IN
TEGUCIGALPA IN A PRESS COMMUNIQUE DISTRIBUTED TO THE MEDIA, WHICH PUBLISHED
AND DISSEMINATED IT -- ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS INCREDIBLE -- THROUGH THE
OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE BULLETINS.  WE MIGHT ADD THAT THE HONDURAN ARMY
HAS ECHOED SUCH REPORTS, AS AN ACCOMPLICE TO A PROPAGANDA PLOY TO COVER UP
AN AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR COUNTRY.

   WE ASK, THEREFORE:  "WHAT IS LEFT OF OUR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS?  WHAT IS
HONDURAS?  WHO ARE HONDURANS?"

SECURITY WAS TIGHT AT PERTH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AS MR.  BUSCHMANN,
46, WAS GIVEN AN ENTHUSIASTIC SEND-OFF BY ABOUT 50 LOCAL SUPPORTERS,
MOST OF THEM MEMBERS OF THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN CHILEAN COMMUNITY.

   BEFORE BOARDING HIS AIRCRAFT, MR. BUSCHMANN SAID THROUGH AN INTERPRETER
THAT HE HAD ACHIEVED HIS GOAL IN AUSTRALIA BY PUBLICISING THE POSITION OF
THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT IN CHILE.  

   THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE INDICATION OF MR. BUSCHMANN'S ULTIMATE
DESTINATION, WHICH WAS EXPECTED TO BE SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE.

   HE HAS REFUGEE STATUS IN SWEDEN, THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH HE MADE HIS VISA
APPLICATION BEFORE BEING ALLOWED INTO AUSTRALIA LAST MONTH.  THE AUSTRALIAN
IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT ARRANGED HIS SUNDAY NIGHT FLIGHT ON SATURDAY AFTER
THE FEDERAL COURT HERE HAD UPHELD A DEPORTATION ORDER AGAINST HIM ON FRIDAY.

   MR. BUSCHMANN HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO SPEND TWO MONTHS IN AUSTRALIA
PUBLICISING, AND RAISING FUNDS FOR, THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ MOVEMENT, WHICH IS
OPPOSED TO THE REGIME OF GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET AND WHICH HE HEADS.

   THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT CUT SHORT HIS TRIP, CLAIMING HE HAD MADE FALSE
OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS IN HIS VISA APPLICATION.

   MR. BUSCHMANN WAS ARRESTED AND DETAINED IN PERTH FOR THREE DAYS BEFORE
BEING RELEASED FIVE DAYS AGO ON THE ORDERS OF THE FEDERAL COURT TO BE PLACED
UNDER VIRTUAL HOUSE ARREST PENDING THE OUTCOME OF FRIDAY'S HEARING.

   HE HAD BEEN STAYING AT THE HOME OF WESTERN AUSTRALIAN STATE LABOR MEMBER
OF PARLIAMENT, DR. IAN ALEXANDER.

   HE PARTICULARLY UPSET THE AUSTRALIAN AUTHORITIES BY PUBLICLY CALLING FOR
THE ASSASSINATION OF GEN. PINOCHET.  AFTER HIS ARRIVAL SANTIAGO APPLIED TO
CANBERRA FOR HIS EXTRADITION.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 15 JUN 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO] [TEXT] MR MINISTER
[HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER CARLOS LOPEZ CONTRERAS]: VARIOUS HONDURAN
PRESS SOURCES HAVE REPORTED ON THE 13 JUNE MEETING BETWEEN THE U.S.
VICE PRESIDENT AND LEADERS OF THE MERCENARY GROUPS, AMONG THEM ENRIQUE
BERMUDEZ, WHO HAVE BEEN USING HONDURAN TERRITORY AS A BASE AND
SANCTUARY FOR ITS CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST NICARAGUA.

   THESE MERCENARY GROUPS HAVE CONTINUED THEIR ATTACKS AGAINST NICARAGUA,
ADDING NEW VICTIMS TO THE THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS WHO HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED
THE EFFECTS OF U.S. AGGRESSION AND THE PARTICIPATION AND COMPLICITY OF YOUR
GOVERNMENT WITH THAT ILLEGAL POLICY.

   THE WELL-KNOWN U.S. POLICY OF MAINTAINING CONTRA FORCES IN HONDURAN
TERRITORY AND ITS CONSTANT CRIMINAL ATTACKS AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN
POPULATION -- WHICH HAVE LEFT 163 CIVILIAN VICTIMS SINCE THE COSTA DEL SOL
SUMMIT ON 31 MAY -- CHARACTERIZES THE TALKS BETWEEN U.S. GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS AND CONTRA LEADERS, AS WELL AS THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES IN THE LOSS
OF HUMAN LIVES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE IN MY COUNTRY.

   WHILE VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE WAS MEETING WITH THE MERCENARIES, PASTORAL
REPRESENTATIVES IN WASLALA AND LAS MINAS INFORMED THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY OF THE HUNDREDS OF PEASANTS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED, KIDNAPPED, AND
TORTURED BY THE MERCENARY GROUPS THAT INFILTRATE NICARAGUA FROM HONDURAS.  

   AT THE SAME TIME, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY REPORTED ON THE CONTINUATION OF
ATTACKS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES, AMONG THEM ONE IN SAN JOSE,
TIJUANA, SOUTHEAST OF ASTURIAS, JINOTEGA DEPARTMENT, WHERE FOUR PEASANTS
WERE KILLED ON 10 JUNE.  

   IN THE COSTA DEL SOL DECLARATION, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO CARRYING OUT THE DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, AND
RELOCATION OF THE MERCENARY GROUPS CURRENTLY BASED IN YOUR COUNTRY.
HOWEVER, YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED -- AGAINST THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS
OF THE HONDURAN PEOPLE -- THE OPTION SET FORTH BY A U.S. BIPARTISAN
AGREEMENT AIMED AT MAINTAINING THE CONTRAS IN HONDURAN TERRITORY.  

   INTERVIEWS WITH HONDURAN POLITICAL LEADERS, SUCH AS THE ONE PUBLISHED IN
THE DAILY LA TRIBUNA IN ITS 13 JUNE EDITION, CLEARLY STATE THAT THE U.S.
VICE PRESIDENT DID NOT GO TO HONDURAS TO SOLVE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, BUT TO
OBTAIN A CONFIRMATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT WILL NOT EXPEL THE CONTRAS
FROM HONDURAN TERRITORY.

   IN CONSENTING TO THE CONTINUED PRESENCE IN ITS TERRITORY OF MERCENARY
FORCES -- WHICH WERE CREATED TO ATTACK MY COUNTRY -- THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT
IS NOT ONLY HELPING TO BRING MORE SUFFERING AND DESTRUCTION TO THE
NICARAGUAN PEOPLE AND NATION, BUT IS ALSO CONTINUING THE HEAVY BURDEN ON THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN THE VICTIMS OF CRIMINAL AND TERRORIST
ACTIONS.  

   WITH THIS BEHAVIOR, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN EVINCES ITS TOTAL
 NONCOMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO EXPRESSED IN
THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS, TO NOT PERMIT THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY TO ATTACK
OTHER STATES AND TO DISCONTINUE ITS SUPPORT FOR IRREGULAR FORCES.

   THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT STRONGLY PROTESTS THE FACT THAT YOUR COUNTRY
CONTINUES TO ALLOW THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY TO CONDUCT ILLEGAL POLICIES THAT
GO AGAINST THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS AND THE PEACE EFFORTS AND THAT VIOLATE
THE PRINCIPLES AND NORMS ESTABLISHED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW TO GUARANTEE THE
PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE OF STATES.

   YOUR GOVERNMENT SHOULD REFLECT ON THIS AND HEED THE CALLS MADE BY THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES, WHO DEMAND AN END TO THE COUNTRY'S INVOLVEMENT
IN AN ILLEGAL AND ADVENTUROUS POLICY AND THAT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN COSTA
DEL SOL CALLING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A JOINT PLAN FOR THE
DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, AND RELOCATION OF THE IRREGULAR FORCES BASED
IN YOUR COUNTRY BE HONORED.

   I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REITERATE MY ESTEEM TO YOUR EXCELLENCY.

   SAO PAULO (BRAZIL), 14 JUN 89 (FOLHA DE SAO PAULO) -- [TEXT] THE
ARGENTINA GOVERNMENT HAS SENT TO BRAZIL A REQUEST OF PREVENTIVE
IMPRISONMENT FOR THE EXTRADITION OF 16 PEOPLE (14 ARGENTINES AND 2
FRENCHMEN) CHARGED WITH BELONGING TO THE "ALL FOR THE FATHERLAND"
TERRORIST GROUP.  THE MEN ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE TAKEN PART IN THE
ATTACK ON THE LA TABLADA MILITARY UNIT IN BUENOS AIRES PROVINCE LAST
JANUARY.

   AT THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST, FERNANDO CARLOS FALCO WAS ARRESTED
ON 9 JUNE.  HE REMAINS IN CUSTODY IN FEDERAL POLICE QUARTERS IN BRASILIA,
AND HE IS WAITING THE EXTRADITION RULING, WHICH WILL BE MADE BY THE FEDERAL
SUPREME CORT (STF).

   ANOTHER ARGENTINE, DAMIAN MAGUE, WHO WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE LA TABLADA
ATTACK, WAS ARRESTED WITH FALCO ON THE SAME DAY.  MAGUE WAS RELEASED BECAUSE
THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT DID NOT REQUEST HIS PREVENTIVE IMPRISONMENT, THE
STF SAID.  IN FALCO'S CASE, THE ARGENTINE COURTS HAVE 45 DAYS TO SEND THE
STF A COPY OF THE LEGAL CASE AGAINST HIM.  THE TRIAL WILL BE BASED ON THE
LEGAL EXTRADITION REQUISITES AND NOT ON THE CRIMINAL ACCUSATIONS AGAINST
FALCO.

   CLANDESTINE, 15 JUN 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)]
[TEXT] CONCERNING DR JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH, THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND REPORTS THE
FOLLOWING TO ALL SALVADORANS:

   1. AS A RESULT OF INVESTIGATIONS WE HAVE CONDUCTED, WE CONFIRM THAT THE
FMLN BEARS NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR THE ATTACK ON DR RODRIGUEZ
PORTH.  WE DELAYED MAKING THIS STATEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE WERE NO
CIRCUMSTANTIAL OR OTHER REASONS THAT COULD HAVE INVOLVED US IN THE ATTACK.

   2. FOLLOWING RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH, SEVERAL GROUPS HAVE CONDUCTED
MARKEDLY VENGEFUL ACTIONS.  COLONEL OCHOA PEREZ, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS PROPOSED
FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE.  FRANCISCO MERINO HAS THREATENED OPPOSITION LEADERS
WITH DEATH.  RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO HAS PROPOSED REPRESSIVE NEW LAWS.

   WE HEREBY WARN THAT IF REPRISALS ARE TAKEN AGAINST THE OPPOSITION
MOVEMENT, WE WILL TAKE FIRM AND RESOLUTE ACTION AGAINST ANY ESCALATION IN
REPRESSION.

   3. WE FIND THE FALSE COMMOTION AMONG THE RANKS OF THE ARENA [NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY REPULSIVE, BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS OF THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY IN KILLINGS LIKE THAT OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, OF THE MEMBERS
OF THE FDR [REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT] EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, AND SO
MANY OTHERS.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN THEIR ALLEGED INNOCENCE, AND DO EVEN
LESS AT A TIME WHEN REPRESSIVE ACTIONS ARE BEING INTENSIFIED.

   4. OUR ATTENTION HAS BEEN DRAWN TO THE FACT THAT THE ATTACK ON RODRIGUEZ
PORTH OCCURRED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN INTENSE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE
ENTREPRENEURIAL SECTOR [OF ARENA] AND D'AUBUISSON'S SUPPORTERS TO
GAIN CONTROL OF THE PARTY, AND WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A DISPUTE FOR THE
DEFENSE MINISTRY.  IN THE LATTER CASE, RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S ACTIONS DID AWAY
WITH GENERAL BUSTILLO'S ASPIRATIONS.  THERE ARE PRECEDENTS FOR THE LINE OF
CONDUCT OF ARENA FACTIONS AND FOR THESE INTERNAL CONFRONTATIONS.  WE RECALL
THE ATTACK THAT ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON PERPETRATED AGAINST FORMER U.S.
AMBASSADOR THOMAS PICKERING.  WE ALSO REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT MEN CLOSE TO
MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSION PARTICIPATED IN THE KIDNAPPING OF BUSINESSMEN.
MAJOR D'AUBUISSION'S SILENCE CONCERNING THE ATTACK ON RODRIGUEZ PORTH IS
NOTEWORTHY.

   THE FMLN UNDERSTANDS THE CONCERN OF THE VARIOUS NATIONAL SECTORS AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE SENSE THAT ARENA MAY USE THIS FACT TO JUSTIFY
IRRATIONAL RETALIATORY ACTIONS.  IF A SITUATION IS BROUGHT ABOUT, INVOLVING
AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE AND EXPANSION OF THE WAR, IT WILL BE THE ARENA
GOVERNMENT'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, NOT OURS.

   FOR THIS REASON, WE HAVE RAISED WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES THE NEED TO
CREATE CONDITIONS FOR ESTABLISHING A FAVORABLE CLIMATE FOR DIALOGUE AND A
NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.  WE REITERATE OUR TOTAL READINESS TO
CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THIS EFFORT.  THE FMLN REASSERTS TO ALL THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO THE TRUTH AND THAT THAT WE WILL BE
FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AT ALL TIMES AND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

   SANTIAGO, 16 JUN 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY, THE CHILEAN MILITARY
GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED THE EXISTENCE OF A SELECTIVE TERRORIST PLAN TO
ATTACK GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, A PLAN THAT COULD BE LINKED TO THE SHINING
PATH, A PERUVIAN TERRORIST GROUP.  

   GENERAL OSCAR VARGAS, THE MINISTER SECRETARY GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT,
REPORTED ON THIS PLAN DURING A 2-HOUR CABINET MEETING THAT WAS CHAIRED BY
CHILEAN PRESIDENT GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET.  

   THE MINISTER SAID THAT THERE ARE CLEAR INDICATIONS OF SUCH A PLAN,
EMPHASIZING THAT THE CIVILIANS HAVE GREAT RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SUBVERSION CANNOT BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE
OF CIVILIANS.

   GEN VARGAS POINTED OUT THAT THE RECENT ATTACKS ON ARMED FORCES AND THE
SECURITY SERVICES PERSONNEL, THE ROBBERY OF CARS -- ACCORDING TO THE POLICE,
A MILITARY TRUCK AND 18 PRIVATE VEHICLES HAVE BEEN STOLEN -- AND THE
STEALING OF CAR LICENSE PLATES AT THE MUNICIPALITIES ARE A CLEAR INDICATION
THAT THESE GROUPS ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN THEIR ACTIVITIES.

   THIS WEEK, SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS ATTACKED AN ARMY NON-
COMMISSIONED OFFICER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
(CNI, THE SECRET POLICE) AND WHO WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED, AND LAST WEEK A
RETIRED AIR FORCE OFFICER WAS MURDERED.  

   THE MINISTER ADDED THAT A COORDINATION AMONG ALL THE TERRORIST GROUPS
THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE AREA HAS BEEN NOTICED, ESPECIALLY BY THE SHINING
PATH.  THIS MATTER WAS DISCUSSED BY THE PERUVIAN DEFENSE MINISTER IN A
SPEECH HE MADE IN LIMA LAST WEEK.

   CONCERNING THE MEASURES TAKEN, GEN VARGAS SAID: "ALL GOVERNMENT
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO TAKE CARE."

   GEN VARGAS CATEGORICALLY DENIED THAT THE POSSIBILITY THAT GENERAL AUGUSTO
PINOCHET COULD RUN IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 14 DECEMBER
1989 WAS DISCUSSED IN THE CABINET MEETING HELD TODAY AT THE LA MONEDA
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.

   FOR HIS PART AND IN A NEWS CONFERENCE, SERGIO ONOFRE JARPA, A RIGHTWING
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE PROGOVERNMENT NATIONAL
RENEWAL PARTY, SAID THAT HIS NOMINATION "WOULD NOT MAKE ANY SENSE IF
PINOCHET RUNS FOR THE SAME POLITICAL SECTOR."

   JARPA REITERATED THAT IF THE INCUMBENT, WHO HAS BEEN PRESIDENT SINCE
1973, WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, "IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REFORM THE 1980
CONSTITUTION" BECAUSE ARTICLE 25 PREVENTS THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT FROM SEEKING
RE-ELECTION.

SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY RENE HURTADO] [TEXT] HURTADO
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THIS MORNING DELIVERED PART OF THE COFFEE TAX,
WHICH WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG ALL THE MAYORS' OFFICES IN THE
COUNTRY.  AFTER THE EVENT AT A SAN SALVADOR HOTEL, CRISTIANI ANSWERED
QUESTIONS, FIRST ON THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] COMMUNIQUE DENYING PARTICIPATION IN THE MURDER OF PRESIDENCY
MINISTER JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH. IN THE COMMUNIQUE, THE FMLN
FLATLY DECLARED THAT NONE OF THEIR MEMBERS HAD HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE MURDER.  CRISTIANI HAD THIS TO SAY:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND SAID THEY HAD
NOT ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION AND ADDED THAT APPARENTLY A GROUP GOT OUT OF
HAND AND PERPETRATED THE CRIME.  I THINK THE FMLN HAS REALIZED THE GENERAL
REPUDIATION THIS ACTION HAS ELICITED.  I AM CONVINCED THE FMLN IS TRYING TO
EXCUSE THE ACTION, THUS AVOIDING ALL RESPONSIBILITY.  WE THINK THEY ARE
TRYING TO SEEK A WAY OUT OF THE PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE ASSASSINATION OF AN
AGED, DEFENSELESS PERSON.  BUT THERE IS NO WAY OUT FOR THEM NOW.

   [HURTADO] THE FMLN HAS DENIED THAT ANY OF ITS MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE
ACTION.

   [CRISTIANI] OF COURSE, THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO DENY IT AFTER THEY LEARNED
OF THE REPUDIATION BOTH HERE AND ABROAD.  IN ADDITION, THEY WAITED A
CONSIDERABLE TIME TO DENY THEIR PARTICIPATION.  THEY HAD A COMPLETE PLAN
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  AS YOU KNOW, THE PLAN IS CALLED "ALL AGAINST ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]."  THIS MURDER WAS PART OF THEIR PLAN.
RODRIGUEZ PORTH HAD NO ENEMIES.  HE WAS A PEACEFUL MAN WHO STRUGGLED WITH
HIS PEN AND IDEAS. ONLY AN IRRATIONAL MIND, LIKE THAT OF THOSE WHO
ADVOCATE VIOLENCE, COULD HAVE CONCEIVED THIS ACTION.  I AM CONVINCED THE
FMLN DID IT.

   [HURTADO] MR PRESIDENT, IF YOU AND THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] ARE CONVINCED
THE FMLN IS GUILTY, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE DIALOGUE?

   [CRITIANI] WE THINK WE SHOULD OVERCOME THE EFFECT OF THIS HEAVY BLOW
CAUSED BY THE LOSS, NOT ONLY OF A COLUMN OF THE PARTY AND OF OUR IDEOLOGY,
BUT ALSO OF A PERSONAL FRIEND.  AS MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT, WE SHOULD
OVERCOME OUR GRIEF AND SEEK THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] VIOLENCE IS REPUDIATED AND REJECTED IN THE COUNTRY.  IT IS TIME
FOR THE FMLN TO TALK ABOUT ITS OBJECTIVES.  THEY HAVE REJECTED THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITH UNACCEPTABLE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE
ARGUMENTS.  BUT OUR PROPOSAL FOR DIALOGUE IS STILL GOOD.  WE ARE WILLING TO
SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THEM SO THIS VIOLENCE CAN END.

   [HURTADO] HAS A COMMISSION ALREADY BEEN FORMED?  

   [CRISTIANI] WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING IT.  SOME OF THE PROPOSED
PERSONS HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO BE MEMBERS.  WE HOPE TO HAVE FORMED THE
COMMISSION BY THE END OF THE WEEK.  AS SOON AS WE HAVE IT, WE WILL GLADLY
ANNOUNCE THE MEMBERS' NAMES. [CONTINUED]

   SANTIAGO, 26 JUN 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] TERRORIST SERGIO
BUSCHMANN, WHO HAD BEEN HELD IN PREVENTIVE CUSTODY IN ALASKA, WAS SET
FREE BY U.S. AUTHORITIES.  THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS
FRUSTRATION OVER THAT DECISION, NOTING THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE
ALL NECESSARY STEPS AT EVERY OCCASION TO BRING SERGIO BUSCHMANN TO
COURT IN CHILE.

   THE INFORMATION WAS MADE PUBLIC BY CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN
CARLOS DUCCI WHEN HE RELEASED AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE FROM THE FOREIGN
MINISTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUCCI] THE FOREIGN MINISTRY WAS INFORMED TODAY BY THE
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE THAT BECAUSE OF LEGAL TECHNICALITIES RELATED TO
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY OF 1900, IT CANNOT KEEP
SERGIO BUSCHMANN IN PREVENTIVE CUSTODY, NOR CAN IT COMPLY WITH THE
EXTRADITION REQUEST THAT IS BEING PREPARED IN CHILE.  THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT
MAKES PUBLIC ITS DISAPPOINTMENT AT THIS DECISION BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
STATE AND THE U.S.  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.  IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT IN THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM THAT SOME COUNTRIES SHOULD LIMIT
THEMSELVES TO EXPELLING THE TERRORIST BUSCHMANN FROM THEIR TERRITORY.  WE
HAVE REQUESTED THAT JUSTICE BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE SO THAT BUSCHMANN CAN BE
SUBMITTED TO DUE PROCESS IN A CASE OF A STRICTLY JUDICIAL NATURE.

   BUSCHMANN HAS BEEN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AS A TERRORIST; HE HAS
ENDORSED VIOLENCE, INCITED ASSASSINATION, AND RAISED FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE
OF ARMS TO KILL CHILEANS.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS HAD AT THE PROPER TIME
THE OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT THE ARMS CLANDESTINELY INTRODUCED IN CHILE FOR
TERRORIST PURPOSES BY SERGIO BUSCHMANN.  THIS ACT HAS BEEN PUBLICLY
CONDEMNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, BECAUSE IT REVEALED THE THREAT
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM POSES TO THE SECURITY OF THE HEMISPHERE.  THE
CHILEAN GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN AND WILL TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS AT EVERY
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING BUSCHMANN TO COURT, AND IT MUST NOW DEPLORE AND REJECT
THE IMPUNITY WITH WHICH THIS AVOWED CRIMINAL WILL CONTINUE TO ENDORSE
TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. [END RECORDING]

   TERRORIST SERGIO BUSCHMANN, SPOKESMAN FOR THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC
FRONT, HAS THE STATUS OF POLITICAL REFUGEE IN SWEDEN.  WHEN CARLOS DUCCI WAS
ASKED IF BUSCHMANN HAS TRAVELED TO SWEDEN, HE REPLIED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW
AND THAT HE ONLY HAS INFORMATION THAT BUSCHMANN HAS BEEN SET FREE.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 17 JUN 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUA
HAS DENIED ANY LINKS WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENCY
MINISTER ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH 8 DAYS AGO, AN ALLEGATION MADE BY THE
SALVADORAN ARMY.  AT A NEWS CONFERENCE, COMMANDER BAYARDO ARCE, VICE
COORDINATOR OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMISSION OF THE RULING SANDINIST
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FSLN, TERMED IRRESPONSIBLE THE CHARGES MADE
IN SAN SALVADOR THAT NICARAGUA TRAINED THE COMMANDO WHO KILLED
RODRIGUEZ PORTH.

   ARCE SAID:  WE LACK THE EXPERIENCE FOR SUCH ATTACKS AND THEREFORE COULD
NOT HAVE TRAINED ANYONE.  HE RECALLED THAT THE FSLN NEVER RESORTED TO THAT
TYPE OF ACTION DURING ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DICTATOR ANASTASIO SOMOZA,
WHO WAS OVERTHROWN IN 1979.

   THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE CLAIMED THAT RODRIGUEZ PORTH WAS KILLED
BY A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COMMANDO TRAINED IN
NICARAGUA.  HOWEVER, THAT GUERRILLA GROUP HAS DENIED ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE ACTION.

   ARCE ALSO DENIED THAT NICARAGUA HAS SENT WEAPONS TO PANAMA WHEN TENSION
WITH THE UNITED STATES INCREASED LAST MONTH, AS REPORTED IN THE U.S. MEDIA.
I AM NOT SURPRISED BY THOSE STATEMENTS, ARCE SAID, ADDING THAT THE UNITED
STATES CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS TO DISCREDIT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH

LA DORADA WAS DYNAMITED.  HUMBERTO BRINES TRAVELED EARLY TODAY TO THE SCENE
OF THE EVENTS AND REPORTED THE FOLLOWING:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BRINES] A NEW ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED LAST NIGHT AGAINST
THE PIPELINE THAT PUMPS CRUDE OIL FROM NEIVA TO DORADA.  SUSPECTED ELN
GUERRILLAS PLACED A DYNAMITE CHARGE AT THE PLACE CALLED LA MOTOSA, NEAR AIPE
MUNICIPALITY, WHICH COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE GUARD POST AND A STRETCH OF THE
PIPELINE.  A FIRE IMMEDIATELY BROKE OUT AND THE INSTALLATION WAS COMPLETELY
GUTTED.

   CRUDE OIL PUMPING WAS SUSPENDED AND EFFORTS TO CONTAIN THE FIRE AND TO
REPAIR THE PIPELINE BEGAN AT 2300.  THE EXTENT OF THE LOSSES HAS NOT YET
BEEN ASSESSED.  THIS PIPELINE PUMPS 58,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY.  THE MAIN
PUMPING STATION IS LOCATED IN AIPE MUNICIPALITY.  WORKERS FROM (JOCOL) AND
ECOPETROL [COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE] WORKED INTENSELY ALL
THROUGH THE PREDAWN HOURS TO REPAIR THE PIPELINE, ENABLING IT TO RESUME
PUMPING OPERATIONS AT 1000.

   EVEN THOUGH THE ELN HAS REPEATEDLY THREATENED THE OIL PIPELINES, WORK HAS
CONTINUED ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MULTIPLE PIPELINE IN HUILA, WHICH
WILL PUMP 138,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY BETWEEN NEIVA AND COVENAS.  THE
SAME PIPELINE WAS BLOWN UP ONLY 1 MONTH AGO, A SCARCE 25 KM FROM THAT PLACE.

CAUSED BY THE LATEST TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S OIL
PIPELINE HAS SO FAR BEEN ESTIMATED AT ALMOST 75 BILLION PESOS.
ACCORDING TO ECOPETROL [COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE], THERE HAVE
BEEN FOUR DYNAMITE ATTACKS ON THE PIPELINE IN THE LAST 72 HOURS.
BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS, COLOMBIA WILL HAVE TO ABSTAIN FROM MARKETING
CRUDE OIL ABROAD FOR 3 WEEKS, THUS LOSING $150 MILLION.  THE DAMAGE
CAUSED TO THE COVENAS PLANT AMOUNTS TO $7 MILLION; ANOTHER $7 MILLION
WILL HAVE TO BE SPENT ON REPAIRS.

   ECOPETROL PRESIDENT ANDRES RESTREPO LONDONO SAID THAT THE COLOMBIAN
PEOPLE WILL FEEL THE IMPACT OF THESE ATTACKS.  ALREADY THE ROYALTIES GIVEN
TO THE MUNICIPALITIES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED, AND AN INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES
WILL BE NECESSARY, ACCORDING TO THE FIRST SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNTRY'S
PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE AUTHORITIES.

   MEANWHILE, THE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS COUNTEROFFENSIVE AGAINST ELN [ARMY
OF NATIONAL LIBERATION] GUERRILLAS, WHICH HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE ATTACKS ON THE OIL PIPELINE, EXERTING PRESSURE TO MODIFY THE OIL
POLICY.  THE LATEST ATTACK ON THE PIPELINE OCCURRED AT THE LISAMA
INSTALLATIONS, LOCATED BETWEEN BARRANCABERMEJA AND BUCARAMANGA.  ELN
GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THESE INSTALLLATIONS, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
PRODUCING GAS AND PETROLEUM.  THE GUERRILLAS CUT 80 PERCENT OF THE CABLES
ATTACHED TO THE MOTORS WHICH EXTRACT FUEL.

   A DYNAMITE CHARGE WAS ALSO PLACED ON THE PIPELINE AT KM-28 IN CANO
LIMON-COVENAS, IN THE AREA OF CARMEN, NEAR THE TONCHALA RIVER, IN NORTHERN
SANTANDER.  NO FUEL, HOWEVER, WAS LOST.  THE ATTACKS HAVE NOW EXTENDED TO
HUILA DEPARTMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME, DAMAGING FUEL INSTALLATIONS.  HERE THE
OIL SPILL WAS STOPPED BY CLOSING DOWN THE INSTALLATIONS.

   FURTHERMORE, NINE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN KILLED, EIGHT MORE HAVE BEEN
CAPTURED, AND AN ELN TRAINING CENTER HAS BEEN DISMANTLED.  THIS IS THE
RESULT OF THE ARMY'S FIRST COUNTERINSURGENCY ACTIONS AGAINST THOSE
DETERMINED TO DO AWAY WITH THE NATION'S RESOURCES BY ATTACKING THE CANO
LIMON-COVENAS PIPELINE.  MILITARY AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT NEAR
SERRANIA DE PERIJA, CESAR DEPARTMENT, THE 2D BRIGADE'S (LA POPA) BATTALION
TROOPS CLASHED WITH ELN GUERRILLAS.  THE CLASH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF SIX
GUERRILLAS AND THE CONFISCATION OF A GREAT AMOUNT OF WAR MATERIEL.

   IN ADDITION, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ARMY DISMANTLED AN ELN URBAN
NETWORK, CAPTURING EIGHT OF ITS MEMBERS.  MEANWHILE, THE 14TH BRIGADE'S
(LUCIANO DE LURIA) BATTALION TROOPS KILLED JOSE ANTONIO VELASCO, A FARC

   BOGOTA, 21 JUN 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN ARMY OF NATIONAL
LIBERATION (ELN) ANNOUNCED TODAY FOR THE FIRST THAT THAT IT IS WILLING TO
ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE ON THE COUNTRY'S OIL POLICY.  THE ELN HAS CARRIED OUT
A DESTRUCTIVE WAVE OF ATTACKS AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO FORCE
THE GOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THIS INDUSTRY.

   THE GUERRILLA GROUP'S WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE IS
CONVEYED IN A TAPE SENT TO CONSERVATIVE SENATOR ALVARO LEYVA FROM FORMER
SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, WHO IS THE ELN'S FOUNDER AND LEADER.  ACCORDING
TO LEYVA, PEREZ EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH HIM TO EXPLAIN THE
GUERRILLA GROUP'S IDEAS ON WHAT COLOMBIA'S OIL POLICY SHOULD BE.  LEYVA SAID
THAT THE ELN ALSO DEMANDED THAT NATIONALIZATION BE APPLIED TO OTHER NATURAL
RESOURCES.

   FURTHERMORE, THE ELN -- WHICH HAS PREVIOUSLY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S
PEACE OFFER -- REITERATED ITS DESIRE TO "HUMANIZE" THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE
GUERRILLAS AND THE ARMY, SO THAT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION WILL NOT BE
AFFECTED.

   LEYVA HAS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN SEEKING A RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN
GUERRILLA GROUPS AND THE GOVERNMENT.  TO THIS END HE HAS MET SEVERAL TIMES
WITH M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] AND REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA
(FARC) COMMANDERS, WHICH IS WHY THE ELN SELECTED HIM AS THE BEARER OF ITS
MESSAGE.

   THE ELN HAS CONCENTRATED ITS TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S MAIN
OIL PIPELINE, WHICH EXTENDS 800 KM FROM THE EASTERN TO THE NORTHWESTERN
REGIONS OF COLOMBIA.  IT HAS CAUSED MILLIONS IN LOSSES TO THE STATE
COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE [ECOPETROL] AND SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE
RESULTING FROM OIL SPILLS.

   IN 1988, IT ATTACKED THE NATION'S PIPELINES APPROXIMATELY 50 TIMES, AND
THUS FAR THIS YEAR THE ELN HAS CARRIED OUT 21 ATTACKS.  ON 16 JUNE, THE MAIN
OIL RESERVES IN THE CARIBBEAN PORT CITY OF COVENAS WERE VIRTUALLY DESTROYED
BY SEVERAL DYNAMITE BLASTS SET OFF BY THE GUERRILLAS.

   THIS WAS THE ELN'S MOST DARING AND SERIOUS ATTACK TO DATE.  THE ELN
CLAIMS THAT THE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES THAT CARRY OUT OIL EXPLORATION AND
DRILLING WITH ECOPETROL ARE "PLUNDERING" COLOMBIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES.

NUN, WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED TODAY WHEN SHOTS WERE FIRED AT A VEHICLE IN
WHICH SHE WAS TRAVELING NEAR ZARAGOZA, 20 KM SOUTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL
CITY, CHURCH SOURCES HAVE REPORTED.

   MAKEIL WAS TRAVELING WITH TWO OTHER NUNS OF THE ORDER OF THE CHARITY OF
THE INCARNATE WORD IN A PRIVATE VEHICLE ALONG THE HIGHWAY BETWEEN SAN
SALVADOR AND ZARAGOZA, WHEN UNIDENTIFIED ASSAILANTS IN ANOTHER VEHICLE
OPENED FIRE.  JUANA MARGARITA FLORES, ONE OF THE NUNS TRAVELING WITH MAKEIL,

   AFTER THE INCIDENT, THE NUNS TOOK MAKEIL TO SAN RAFAEL HOSPITAL IN SANTA
TECLA.  HOWEVER, DUE TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF HER CONDITION, SHE WAS
TRANSPORTED OVERNIGHT TO A PRIVATE HOSPITAL IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL CITY,
WHERE SHE WILL UNDERGO EMERGENCY SURGERY.  

   THE THREE NUNS WORK AT THE OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO COMMUNITY (COAR), WHICH
TAKES CARE OF WAR ORPHANS.  IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT IN 1980, FOUR U.S.
NUNS WHO WERE TRAVELING FROM THE COMALAPA AIRPORT TO SAN SALVADOR WERE
KILLED BY SALVADORAN NATIONAL GUARDSMEN.

PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS WARNED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS
PRESSURING THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA
TO INCREASE ITS "AGGRESSIVE" ACTIONS AGAINST THE SANDINISTS.

   DURING A MEETING WITH INDUSTRIALISTS IN MASAYA, 35 KM SOUTH OF MANAGUA,
ORTEGA SOUNDED IRRITATED IN LIGHT OF THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT'S THREATS TO
BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.

   ON SATURDAY, THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED A NOTE TO PROTEST
STATEMENTS BY NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D' ESCOTO AGAINST HONDURAN
PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA, WHOM D' ESCOTO ACCUSED OF HAVING IMPLEMENTED A
"NARCOSTATE".

   ORTEGA SAID:  "WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HONDURAS FEELS OFFENDED WHEN WE
ARE THE ONES WHO WERE OFFENDED, NOT THEM."

   "WE COULD HAVE BROKEN RELATIONS WITH THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT A LONG TIME
AGO, FROM THE MOMENT HONDURAS WAS FIRST USED AS A SPRINGBOARD TO ATTACK
NICARAGUA," THE SANDINIST LEADER STRESSED.

   THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY YESTERDAY WARNED, IN A VEILED MANNER, THAT
NICARAGUA BECAUSE OF WHAT IT DESCRIBED AS " D' ESCOTO'S DIRTY REMARKS."'

   HONDURAS "HAS REACTED WITH JUSTIFIED INDIGNATION, TO THE POINT OF
REQUESTING A BREAK IN RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA," THE HONDURAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY ADDED.  

   D' ESCOTO, WHO IS CURRENTLY IN VENEZUELA, CRITICIZED HONDURAS' POLICY AND
SAID THAT HONDURAS IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE COUNTRY TO HOLD THE NEXT CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

   THE HEAD OF NICARAGUA SAID THAT THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES "HAVE OFFENDED
THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WITH THEIR WORDS AND ACTIONS, AND THEY HAVE SERVED AS
A SPRINGBOARD FOR THE MURDER OF CHILDREN AND THE MUTILATION OF THE
NICARAGUAN PEOPLE."

   ORTEGA ALSO CRITICIZED U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE'S VISIT TO
TEGUCIGALPA AND SAID THAT THOSE MEETINGS IN WHICH NICARAGUA WAS ATTACKED
"MUST BE DENOUNCED."

OFFICER WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE CARRIED OUT ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE
HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND GOVERNMENT TURNED HIMSELF OVER TO HONDURAN
MILITARY AUTHORITIES TODAY.  

   THE INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS CAPTAIN ADAN SOLORZANO MARTINEZ,
SAID HE HAD BEEN TRAINED IN CUBA IN 1980, AND SAID WAS IN HONDURAS ON AN
ESPIONAGE MISSION WITH TWO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SANDINIST ARMY, WHOM HE DID
NOT IDENTIFY.

   SOLORZANO CALLED TOGETHER A GROUP OF NEWSMEN IN THE CITY OF SAN PEDRO
SULA, IN NORTHERN HONDURAS, AND TURNED HIMSELF OVER TO THE MILITARY
AUTHORITIES IN THE REPORTERS' PRESENCE.

   THE OFFICER DECLINED TO GIVE DETAILS ABOUT "DELICATE MATTERS" ABOUT WHICH
HE WILL BRIEF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES.  HE SAID THEY CONCERN HIS
ACTIVITIES IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE MAY.

   THE DEFECTOR SAID HE ARRIVED IN HONDURAS IN AUGUST 1988 WITH AN
IDENTIFICATION CARD FROM THE HONDURAN NATIONAL REGISTRY OF PERSONS
IDENTIFYING HIM AS A HONDURAN FROM COMAYAGUA, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE
COUNTRY.

   HE TOLD THE PRESS HE HAS BEEN A SANDINIST SINCE 1974 AND HAD BEEN AN
URBAN GUERRILLA LEADER DURING THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SOMOZIST REGIME IN
NICARAGUA.

   HE SAID THE DE FACTO GOVERNMENT AND THE CONTINUED RETENTION OF POWER BY
THE SANDINISTS FORCED HIM TO DEFECT.  HE ADDED THAT GROUPS OF SANDINISTS
HAVE BEEN INFILTRATED INTO TEGUCIGALPA, SAN PEDRO SULA, AND OTHER PARTS OF
HONDURAS TO CAUSE SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION.  

   HE EXPLAINED THAT AMONG OTHER ACTIVITIES, THEIR MISSION WAS TO KILL
LEADERS OF MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND THEN ATTRIBUTE THE DEATHS TO THE HONDURAN
ARMED FORCES, THEREBY FOMENTING SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION IN THE COUNTRY.

   HE ADDED THAT HIS CONTACTS WERE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY AND THAT HE RECEIVED
$2,500 A MONTH TO CARRY OUT HIS ACTIVITIES IN HONDURAS.  

   THE DEFECTOR SAID SANDINIST OFFICERS DIRECT THE GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR
AND THAT THE ASSASSINATION IN FEBRUARY OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ,
FORMER COMMANDER OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES, WAS PLOTTED IN MANAGUA.

   THE DEFECTOR SAID ALVAREZ HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN THE SANDINISTS' SIGHTS
BECAUSE HE WAS THE MAIN PROMOTER OF THE CONTRAS (NICARAGUAN ARMED
OPPOSITION).

   SOLORZANO SAID NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO HAS MANY
"DELICATE THINGS" TO SAY AGAINST HONDURAS AND COSTA RICA.  [AS RECEIVED]

SINCE HE ASSUMED THE PRESIDENTCY ON 14 JANUARY 1986.  

   CEREZO, WHO AVOIDED GIVING DETAILS ABOUT THE TWO ATTEMPTS, STATED THAT
"THERE IS SPECIFIC INFORMATION" ABOUT AN ALLEGED PLAN TO MURDER HIM.  HE
ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO ONE CAN BE ARRESTED WITHOUT EVIDENCE.

   CEREZO ASSERTED THAT HE WITHDREW LAST WEEK TO SANTO TOMAS FARM,
APPROXIMATELY 43 KM SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, TO THINK, STUDY GUATEMALA'S
PROBLEMS, AND REST.  

   CEREZO SAID HE ALSO RETREATED TO HIS FARM TO GIVE HIS SECURITY OFFICIALS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESCHEDULE ACTIVITIES AND CHANGE METHODS TO INCREASE THEIR
PROTECTION WITHOUT AFFECTING THE POPULATION OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENT AND THE PEOPLE.

   ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUMMONING OF FOUR CIVILIANS WHO WERE LINKED
WITH ONE OF THE PLANS TO MURDER HIM, CEREZO SAID THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE
POLICE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ALLEGED PLAN.

   THE SECOND PLAN WAS REVEALED EARLY THIS MONTH BY HUGO ARCE, A COLUMNIST
OF THE GUATEMALAN OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER EL GRAFICO, WHO 
 THE MURDER WAS GOING TO BE CARRIED OUT BY A LIBYAN COMMANDO UNIT THAT HAD
ENTERED GUATEMALA IN DECEMBER 1988 AND HAD BEEN TRAINED IN CUBA.

   CEREZO SAID THAT ARCE MUST TELL EVERYTHING HE KNOWS, BECAUSE OTHERWISE
"HE WOULD BE CONCEALING THE PLAN, WHICH IS A CRIME TO DO."

   OTHER CIVILIANS WHO WILL ALSO BE SUMMONED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
OFFICE ARE MARIO DAVID GARCIA, NICOLAS BUONAFINA, BOTH SUSPECTED OF
INVOLVEMENT IN THE ATTEMPTED COUP OF MAY 1988, AND JUAN MAEGLI.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID HE TRUSTS HIS SECURITY FORCES AND THAT IT IS VERY
EASY TO DISPLAY A LARGE-SCALE PROTECTION SYSTEM, BUT "THAT IS NEITHER MY
STYLE NOR THAT OF MY ASSISTANTS," CEREZO STRESSED.

   CEREZO ADDED THAT THE STATE HAS SECURITY MECHANISMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER
STRANGE THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY BUT THOSE MECHANISMS CANNOT
ALWAYS BE USED AS EVIDENCE TO ARREST A PERSON.

   CEREZO DID NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRST ALLEGED PLAN TO MURDER
HIM.

REPRESENTATIVES REPORTED TODAY THAT THREE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH
THE KILLING OF TWO U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES.  THE KILLINGS OCCURRED IN LA
PAZ ON 24 MAY.  

   THE KILLING OF THE TWO U.S. MISSIONARIES WAS CLAIMED BY A SELF- STYLED
"ZARATE WILLCA ARMED FORCES LIBERATION" GROUP. THIS IS THE SAME GROUP THAT
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK ON GEORGE SHULTZ WHEN HE VISITED LA
PAZ IN AUGUST 1988 IN HIS CAPACITY AS U.S.  SECRETARY OF STATE.

   IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, BOLIVIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ARRESTED DOZENS OF
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.  THEIR RELATIVES AND COB OFFICIALS HAVE CRITICIZED
THESE ARRESTS, WHICH THEY CLAIM "ARE AN ILLEGAL AND ARBITRARY ACTION."

   THE COB LEADERS HAVE REPORTED THAT THOSE ARRESTED HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS
CONSTANTINO YUJRA, A SOCIOLOGY STUDENT; TELMA SALAZAR, A NURSING STUDENT;
AND ALBERTO MENDOZA, A STUDENT AT THE WARISATA RURAL SCHOOL.

   MOREOVER, THE SOCIAL SCIENCE SCHOOL OF THE SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY HAS
DECLARED ITSELF IN A "STATE OF EMERGENCY" UNTIL THE STUDENTS ARE RELEASED.
THE SCHOOL HAS ALSO CALLED A PROTEST MEETING FOR 30 JUNE.

   MORMON MISSIONARIES JEFFREY BRENT BALL AND RAY TODD WILSON WERE THE

   UMOPAR FORCES HAVE ALSO ARRESTED 30 PEASANTS IN PUERTO SAN FRANCISCO,
CHAPARE, AFTER A POLICE PATROL WAS FORCED TO RELEASE 2 DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND
HAD TO FLEE FROM A CROWD OF NEARLY 1,000 PEASANTS.

   SOCIAL DEFENSE UNDER SECRETARY GENARO MARQUEZ SAID THE INCIDENT OCCURRED
AFTER A MINE-MAN UMOPAR PATROL CAPTURED TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE PEASANTS
INTERCEPTED THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THE TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE BEING TAKEN TO
CHIMORE.  THE POLICE AGENTS HAD TO RELEASE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AFTER THE
PEASANTS THREATENED TO SHOOT THEM.  

   THE CROWD CONTINUED TO THREATEN THE PATROL, FORCING THE UMOPAR AGENTS TO
FLEE INTO THE WOODS.  THE PEASANTS -- SOME 400 STRONG -- BURNED THE UMOPAR
PICKUP AND CHASED THE POLICE INTO THE WOODS.

   UNDER SECRETARY GENARO MARQUEZ EXPLAINTS:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MARQUEZ] YESTERDAY, UMOPAR RAIDED SOME AREAS DURING
THE MORNING AND CLASHED WITH A LARGE GROUP OF PEASANTS IN PUERTO SAN

MORALES.  THE AGENTS HAD TO RELEASE TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS THEY WERE
BRINGING WITH THEM.  THEY WERE ABLE TO FLEE THE AREA AFTER SOME
DIFFICULTIES BUT WILL CONTINUE INVESTIGATING.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END

   MARQUEZ SAID THE 30 ARRESTED PEASANTS WILL BE QUESTIONED TO DETERMINE
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE INCIDENT AND THOSE WHO ARE INNOCENT WILL BE
RELEASED.  MARQUEZ ALSO SAID POLICE SEIZED ARMS AND STICKS OF DYNAMITE.

   BOGOTA, 2 JUL 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] FOUR COLOMBIAN LEFTIST GUERRILLA GROUPS
ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO PROMOTE A DIRECT PEACE DIALOGUE
WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, THIS WILL BRING TO FIVE
THE NUMBER OF REBEL GROUPS THAT HAVE REPORTEDLY ACCEPTED THE PEACE
PROPOSAL THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT MADE IN SEPTEMBER 1988.

   THE LEFTIST M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT], WHICH APPEARED IN THE
MID-1970'S, KIDNAPPED 20 AMBASSADORS IN AN ATTACK ON THE DOMINICAN EMBASSY
IN BOGOTA, AND OCCUPIED THE JUSTICE PALACE IN NOVEMBER 1985 -- AN ACTION
THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 100 PEOPLE -- HAS BEEN HOLDING PEACE TALKS
WITH THE BARCO GOVERNMENT SINCE DECEMBER.

   BOGOTA'S RADIO CADENA NACIONAL REPORTED THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED
FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC, COMMUNIST), THE MARXIST-LENINIST POPULAR
LIBERATION ARMY (EPL), THE INDIAN QUINTIN LAME COMMANDO UNIT, AND THE
REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS PARTY (PRT) ATTENDED A GUERRILLA SUMMIT HELD IN THE
PARAMO DE SUMAPAZ MOUNTAINS, IN SOUTHWEST BOGOTA, THIS WEEKEND.

   DURING THE GUERRILLA SUMMIT, THE FOURTH SINCE THE CREATION OF THE SIMON
BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNGSM), A DOCUMENT WAS DRAFTED
PROPOSING DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

   ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT BROADCAST BY RADIO CADENA NATIONAL, A DIALOGUE,
SIMILAR TO THE ONE BEING HELD WITH M-19, "WOULD SERVE TO ESTABLISH THE
NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR PEACE AND NATIONAL HARMONY."

   CONTRARY TO WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED, THE PROPOSAL WAS NOT SENT TO
PRESIDENT BARCO, BUT TO MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, FORMER OPPOSITION SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVE PARTY PRESIDENT WHO RULED FROM 1970 - 1974.  PASTRANA IS A
MEMBER OF A COMMISSION OF NOTABLES CREATED TO MEDIATE FOR PEACE.  THIS
COMMISSION SHOULD ANALYZE THE PROPOSAL AND PRESENT IT TO THE GOVERNMENT IN A
FEW DAYS.

   APPARENTLY ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THE SIMON BOLIVAR SUMMIT WERE DELEGATES
OF M-19 AND THE ELN, A GROUP THAT HAS UNLEASHED A VIOLENT CAMPAIGN TO
DESTROY THE OIL INDUSTRY INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY THE LEADING CANO
LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE THAT CROSSES THE COUNTRY EAST TO WEST AND COVERS
NEARLY 800 KMS.

   THE DOCUMENT STRESSES THE NEED TO REACH A PEACEFUL POLITICAL SOLUTION TO
THE ARMED CONFLICT, WHICH THE COUNTRY HAS HAD TO PUT UP WITH FOR THE PAST 40
YEARS.

   THE SIGNATORIES OF THE DOCUMENT ASSERTED THAT "DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH THE
GOVERNMENT IS ONE OF THE MECHANISMS THAT COULD LEAD TO A SOLUTION."  THE
GOVERNMENT MUST CARRY OUT ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SO-CALLED PARAMILITARY
(SELF-DEFENSE) GROUPS WITH EVEN MORE DETERMINATION, THE DOCUMENT SAID.

   THEY ALSO DEMAND AN END TO THE "DIRTY WAR."

   MEANWHILE, IT WAS LEARNED THAT FORMER PRESIDENT MISAEL PATRANA BORRERO
HAS SUMMONED THE NOTABLES COMMISSION, COMPRISED OF FABIO ECHEVERRI CORREA,
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INDUSTRIALISTS (ANDI) AND CARDINAL
MARIO REVOLLO CORREA, TO A MEETING ON MONDAY TO REVIEW THE DOCUMENT AND
PRESENT IT TO PRESIDENT BARCO.

   THE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY THE FARC, THE EPL, THE QUINTIN LAME, AND THE
PRT -- ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ABIDING BY THE UNILATERAL TRUCE SINCE
EARLY THIS YEAR -- LEAVES THE ELN AS THE ONLY ACTIVE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA
GROUP.  

   HOWEVER, THAT SUBVERSIVE GROUP, LED BY SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ,
ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THE POSSIBILITY OF OPENING CHANNELS FOR PEACE IF A DATE
IS SET FOR A MEETING, IN THE NEAR FUTURE, TO ANALYZE THE COUNTRY'S CURRENT
OIL POLICIES.

   THE ELN HAS OFFERED TO STOP ITS ATTACKS IF THE OIL INDUSTRY IN THE
COUNTRY IS NATIONALIZED.

   GUTIERREZ CASTRO, A 48-YEAR-OLD MAN, WAS RETURNING TO SAN SALVADOR FROM
THE BEACH IN LA LIBERTAD WHEN HIS CAR WAS SHOT AT NEAR THE TOWN OF ZARAGOZA,
APPROXIMATELY 10 KM FROM SAN SALVADOR.  GUTIERREZ CASTRO WAS IN THE CAR WITH
HIS TWO SONS.

   ONE OF HIS BODYGUARDS, WHOM THE AUTHORITIES DID NOT IDENTIFY, DIED ON THE
SPOT, WHILE HIS CHILDREN AND THE OTHER MEMBER OF HIS ESCORT WERE NOT INJURED.

   IN A DECLARATION IN WHICH HE CONDEMNED ALL TYPES OF VIOLENCE IN THE
COUNTRY, "REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT COMES FROM," THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE
PRESIDENT TOLD THE MEDIA THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IF HE WAS THE TARGET OF THE
ATTACK.

   GUTIERREZ CASTRO REPLACES FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO, WHO COMPLETED HIS
5-YEAR TERM.

   NO ORGANIZATION HAS YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.

   THE LAST ATTACK WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS OCCURRED IN JUNE, AND THE
AUTHORITIES ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN), BUT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION DENIED THE ACCUSATION.

   ON THAT OCCASION THREE UNIDENTIFIED MEN SHOT AND KILLED 65-YEAR- OLD
PRESIDENCY MINISTER ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH.

   BOGOTA, 4 JUL 89 (RUDE PRAVO) -- [ARTICLE] [MANUEL CEPEDA, MEMBER
OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE POLITBURO] [TEXT]
RECENTLY NEW PHENOMENA HAVE MADE THEIR WAY ONTO THE COLOMBIAN
POLITICAL SCENE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS
HAS BEEN FORCED TO ADOPT MEASURES AGAINST ULTRA RIGHT-WING
PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATIONS AND DIFFERENCES ARE BEGINNING TO APPEAR IN
THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THE ARMED FORCES.

   THESE ARGUMENTS ARE TAKING PLACE IN CONNECTION WITH DISCUSSIONS PRIOR TO
THE ELECTIONS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE IN COLOMBIA IN 1990.  AFTER
THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY [CCP] HAD DEMANDED FROM THE GOVERNMENT SECURE
GUARANTEES THAT IT CAN PARTICIPATE IN THEM, IT ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL BECOME
INVOLVED IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND NOW IT IS STRIVING TO CREATE A BROAD
DEMOCRATIC COALITION.

   THE APPROACHING ELECTIONS AS WELL AS THE WIDESPREAD INTERNATIONAL
CONDEMNATION OF THE "DIRTY WAR" IN COLOMBIA FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE
MORE DECISIVE STEPS IN A NUMBER OF SPHERES.  THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ARE:

   -- ISSUING PRESIDENTIALLY PROCLAIMED DECREES AGAINST HIRED ASSASSINS AND
CREATING AN ELITE MILITARY FORCE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THEM; ORGANIZING A
STRUGGLE AGAINST ULTRA RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS AND INCREASING PRISON
SENTENCES UP TO 20-30 YEARS FOR SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF
THEM;

   -- CONDUCTING A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE LEFTIST COALITION PATRIOTIC UNION
(WHICH THE CCP IS A MEMBER OF) AND THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WITH
THE PARTICIPATION OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE;

   -- CONDUCTING A PURGE IN THE ARMY DIRECTED AGAINST THE OFFICERS WHO ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH WITH GROUPS OF HIRED ASSASSINS.

   THE REASON FOR ACCELERATING THESE MEASURES WAS THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
AGAINST THE HEAD OF THE SECRET POLICE (DAS), GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ,
CARRIED OUT ON 30 MAY BY PARAMILITARY GROUPS WHICH ARE CONTROLLED BY DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.  A VEHICLE FILLED WITH 100 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS USED TO TRY TO
ASSASSINATE THE HEAD OF STATE SECURITY.  THE GENERAL ESCAPED WITHOUT INJURY
BUT DURING THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 7 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND MORE THAN 50
WERE WOUNDED.  BECAUSE OF THIS ACT DIFFERENCES IN THE ARMED FORCES AND IN
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT FURTHER INTENSIFIED.

   MAZA MARQUEZ HAS BEEN THE SWORN ENEMY OF THE MAFIA AND THE OBJECT OF
THEIR THREATS SINCE HE REVEALED THAT THE GANGS WHICH CARRY OUT ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPTS AGAINST THE CCP AND THE PATRIOTIC UNION ARE TRAINED MERCENARIES
FROM THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL, THE FRG, AND GREAT BRITAIN.  AFTER ESCAPING
FROM AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON 3 MAY, GENERAL MAZA MARQUEZ SENT A LETTER
TO THE STATE PROSECUTOR.  IN IT HE SAID THAT CERTAIN GROUPS IN THE ARMY KNEW
ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED AGAINST HIM.  

   DURING THE SAME PERIOD CAPTAIN WANUMEN [NAME AS PUBLISHED] WAS
IMPRISONED; HE HAD SECRET DOCUMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, THE
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BOGOTA, THE DAS, AND THE
AMERICAN CIA WHICH LIST HIGHLY PLACED INDIVIDUALS IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO WORK
AS "SPIES" FOR THE BENEFIT OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM THE MEDELLIN AND CALI
CARTELS.  ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT BARCO VARGAS DENIED THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE
DOCUMENTS, REPORTS ARE GENERALLY DISSEMINATED THAT THE RULING ELITE HAS BEEN
INFILTRATED WITH MAFIA AGENTS.

   IN THIS SITUATION SPACE OPENS UP FOR THE CCP'S PROPOSAL TO INTRODUCE
PEACE TO THE COUNTRY BY WAY OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL
PARTISAN GROUPS, NOT JUST WITH THE M-19 MOVEMENT, AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS
PRACTICED TO DATE.  ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA IS STILL SERIOUS,
THERE ARE DEFINITE SIGNS OF A TURNAROUND FOR THE BETTER.

FEELING OF REGRET CONCERNING THE INCIDENT AND ASSURED THAT ALL NECESSARY
STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN TO LOCATE GUILTY PERSONS AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF
SOVIET PEOPLE.

   THE SOVIET TRAWLER SHIPS WERE IN CALLAO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
INTER-GOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE USSR AND PERU ON COOPERATION IN

   TEGUCIGALPA, 5 JUL 89 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FOREIGN MINISTRY] [TEXT] THE HONDURAN FOREIGN RELATIONS MINISTRY,
BASED ON REPORTS FROM AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF SECURITY MATTERS
RELATED TO THE INTERROGATION OF CAPTAIN ADAN SOLORZANO MARTINEZ -- AN
INTELLIGENCE AGENT OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT -- INFORMS THE NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OF THE FOLLOWING:

   IT IS A KNOWN FACT THAT WITH THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE ARMS RACE BY THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT AND THE USE OF NICARAGUAN TERRITORY AS A POLITICAL AND
MILITARY BASE FOR SUBVERSIVE GROUPS, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES, ASSASSINATIONS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, AND
OTHER FORMS OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION IN THE REGION.

   OVER THE PAST 9 YEARS, EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY TARGET OF
INTERNATIONAL SUBVERSION AND TERRORISM.  HONDURAS, HOWEVER, HAS ALSO BEEN
AFFECTED BY THESE ACTIONS ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS.

   WE RECALL THE DEPLORABLE KIDNAPPING OF 100 PERSONS AT THE CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES IN CORTES IN 1982; THE ILLEGAL HIJACKING OF
TAN-SAHSA AIRCRAFT BY TERRORIST COMMANDOS WHO ALWAYS ENDED UP SEEKING REFUGE
IN MANAGUA OR HAVANA; THE PLANTING OF TWO BOMBS THAT DESTROYED POWER PLANTS
IN TEGUCIGALPA, AS WELL AS OTHER TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST HONDURAS BOTH INSIDE
AND OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY; CLANDESTINE ARMS TRAFFICKING, ETC.

   ON 27-28 JUNE, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED BY A
STATEMENT MADE IN SAN PEDRO SULA BY A NICARAGUAN CITIZEN WHO, ACCORDING TO
HIS STATEMENTS, IS AN ARMY CAPTAIN AND INTELLIGENCE AGENT FOR THE SANDINIST
REGIME.  HE DISCLOSED THAT, IN AUGUST 1988, HE WAS ASSIGNED THE MISSIONS OF
PLANNING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE
BEHEADING OF THE HONDURAN SPIRITUAL AND POLITICAL LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE
PHYSICAL ELIMINATION OF HONDURAN ARCHBISHOP MSGR HECTOR ENRIQUE SANTOS AND
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CARLOS ROBERTO FLORES AND RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS
ROMERO, OF THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL PARTIES RESPECTIVELY.

   THE SANDINIST FOREIGN MINISTRY RESPONDED TO THESE REPORTS BY ISSUING A 29
JULY 1989 COMMUNIQUE, IN WHICH IT OPENLY ADMITTED THAT NICARAGUAN CITIZEN
ORLANDO ADAN SOLORZANO MARTINEZ WAS AN ARMY LIEUTENANT -- NOT A CAPTAIN --
AND THAT HE HAD WORKED FOR THE NICARAGUAN INTERIOR MINISTRY FOR 7 AND 1/2
YEARS, FROM 20 AUGUST 1979 TO 28 JANUARY 1987.

   THE COMMUNIQUE ADDED THAT ON 28 JANUARY 1987, SOLORZANO HAD BEEN FIRED
AND THAT HIS RECORD SHOWED A LONG LIST OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. THIS
EXPLANATION VERY CONVENIENTLY ALLOWS NICARAGUA TO DISASSOCIATE ITSELF FROM
THE ESPIONAGE AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENT IN THE
EVENT HE WAS CAUGHT OR DESERTED.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT,
BECAUSE OF ITS IDEOLOGY AND BECAUSE IT HAS CLOSE TIES TO THE FINANCING AND
TRAINING -- BOTH POLITICALLY AND MILITARILY -- OF CENTRAL AMERICAN
TERRRORIST GROUPS, HAS BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED AT VARIOUS LEVELS IN THESE
GROUPS' CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, WHICH VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL NORMS ON PEACEFUL
COEXISTENCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  THIS SITUATION HAS GIVEN RISE TO THE
DIFFERENT PEACE EFFORTS THAT HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE REGION TO ATTEMPT TO
PUT AN END TO THESE ACTIONS.  THE HONDURAN SECURITY AUTHORITIES HAVE KNOWN
FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES AGAINST HONDURAS AND THE LINKS
BETWEEN NICARAGUAN EMBASSY PERSONNEL IN TEGUCIGALPA AND HONDURAN REBEL
GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN SPECIAL CAMPS IN NICARAGUA AND OTHER
TOTALITARIAN COUNTRIES.  [CONTINUED]

THIS IS THE CHALLENGE WE ARGENTINES ARE FACING -- THE CHALLENGE OF
BEING ABLE TO TRANSFORM THIS CRISIS INTO A FERTILE SCENARIO.

   THIS IS THE TIME FOR REFLECTION AND IMAGINATION.  THIS IS THE TIME FOR
IDEAS, AS WELL AS FOR CREATIVITY AND BOLDNESS. THIS IS THE TIME TO ELIMINATE
WHAT IS DECREPIT AND WELCOME WHAT IS BEGINNING.  THIS IS THE TIME FOR
CREATIVE BOLDNESS, INNOVATION, AND COURAGE.

THEREFORE, OURS IS A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY. IN OUR OPINION, NATIONAL
UNITY IS NOT STRENGTHENED BY HEGEMONIC PROJECTS, PATERNAL ATTITUDES,
PASSIONATE FITS, OR FLEETING EMOTIONS.

   GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE CANNOT DEPEND
ON THE MANDATE OF A SINGLE MAN, THE WHIM OF A PARTY, OR THE IMPOSITION OF A

   THE GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY IS THE PROPERTY OF ALL ARGENTINES.  NO
ONE CAN FEEL UNINTERESTED.  NO ONE CAN FEEL UNINVITED.

   IF ARGENTINA IS NOT OCCUPYING ITS PROPER PLACE, IT IS NOT THE COUNTRY'S
BUT ALL ARGENTINES RESPONSIBILITY.  IT SHOULD BE BLAMED ON OUR DIVISIONS,
HISTORIC BURDENS, IDEOLOGICAL PREJUDICES, AND SECTARIANISMS.

   WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FORMULATE AN HONEST BALANCE OF OUR COUNTRY'S
VICTORIES AND FAILURES, ITS WEAK AND STRONG POINTS, AND ITS MISTAKES AND
ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

   THIS IS THE FIRST LESSON WE HAVE ALREADY LEARNED TOGETHER BECAUSE THE
TIME OF THE WORST UNDERDEVELOPMENT, THE UNDERDEVELOPMENT OF CONSIDERING
THOSE WHO THINK DIFFERENTLY AN ENEMY, HAS ENDED IN THIS COUNTRY.  APPLAUSE

   THANK GOD, THE COUNTRY WHERE THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE PREVAILED HAS ENDED.

ANTHROPOLOGIST BRUCE OLSON WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THE ELN HAD
KIDNAPPED AND SENTENCED OLSON TO DEATH. ELN MILITARY COMMANDER NICOLAS
RODRIGUEZ ANNOUNCED THIS DECISION TO REPORTERS FROM THE SPANISH NEWS
AGENCY EFE.

   OLSON, A PHILOSOPHER AND ANTHROPOLOGIST, ARRIVED IN COLOMBIA 30 YEARS AGO
AND WAS WORKING WITH THE MOTILONES INDIANS IN THE CATATUMBO JUNGLE AT THE
TIME OF HIS CAPTURE.  HE HAD BUILT 14 SCHOOLS AND SEVERAL HEALTH CENTERS IN
THE AREA.  HE HAD ALSO WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS ON THE MOTILO INDIAN LANGUAGE.
THE ELN, HOWEVER, ACCUSED HIM OF BEING A CIA AGENT AND AN EXPLOITER OF THE
INDIAN PEOPLE.  THE ELN KIDNAPPED OLSON, DECLARED HIM A PRISONER OF WAR, AND
SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH.  HOWEVER, THIS NIGHTMARE IS NOW OVER.  THE ELN HAS
PROMISED TO TURN OLSON OVER SAFE AND SOUND TO THE RED CROSS IN THE NEXT FEW
DAYS.

   IN ADDITION, THE ELN SENT A LETTER TO PRESIDENT BARCO.  PARLIAMENTARIANS
GUILLERMO ALBERTO GONZALEZ AND ORLANDO GOMEZ WILL DELIVER THE LETTER TO THE
PRESIDENT TOMORROW.  IN THIS LETTER, THE ELN LISTS ITS DEMANDS, WHICH, IF
MET, WOULD LEAD THEM TO HALT THE BLOWING UP OF OIL PIPELINES.  

   ACCORDING TO GONZALEZ, THE GUERRILLA GROUP DEMANDS THE DISMISSAL OF MINES
MINISTER OSCAR MEJIA AND ECOPETROL [COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE]
PRESIDENT ANDRES RESTREPO.  THE ELN ALSO CONDITIONED THEIR SUSPENSION OF
ATTACKS AGAINST THE PIPELINES ON THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL PETROLEUM
COUNCIL AND A FORUM FOR A DEBATE TO REVIEW THE CURRENT OIL POLICY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GONZALEZ] MY IMPRESSION DURING MY 2 DAYS OF

   MOSCOW (USSR), 9 JUL 89 (IZVESTIYA) -- [REPORT] [A. CHEREPANOV,
MEXICO CITY CORRESPONDENT] [TEXT] AS IZVESTIYA HAS ALREADY REPORTED,
ON 5 JULY AT 1000 HOURS LOCAL [PERU] TIME, A BUS WITH SOVIET SEAMEN ON
BOARD WAS BLOWN UP BY A BOMB.  AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION 20 PEOPLE
WERE INJURED, OF WHOM 17 WERE HOSPITALIZED, 3 OF THEM IN A SERIOUS
CONDITION.

   OUR MEXICO CITY CORRESPONDENT A. CHEREPANOV CALLED EMBASSY AND MINISTRY
OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES IN LIMA.  HERE ARE THE ADDITIONAL
DETAILS HE MANAGED TO OBTAIN.  ON THE MORNING OF 5 JULY A GROUP OF 52 PEOPLE
IN TWO BUSES VISITED THE "ALBATROS" STORE, AS IS THE CUSTOM AMONG OFF-DUTY
CREWS FROM SOVIET FISHING VESSELS WORKING IN PERUVIAN COASTAL WATERS.  THE
EXPLOSION OCCURRED ON ONE OF THE BUSES AS IT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE.

   FORTUNATELY, THE BOMB WAS HOMEMADE AND NOT THAT POWERFUL.  AND IT HAD
OBVIOUSLY BEEN HASTILY PLANTED (ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, FOUR SUSPICIOUS
CHARACTERS HAD BEEN HANGING AROUND THE BUS).  THE PASSENGERS WERE INJURED
MAINLY BY PIECES OF BROKEN GLASS.

   THE POLICE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE ON THE SCENE IMMEDIATELY.  NEARLY
ALL THE CASUALTIES WERE IMMEDIATELY HOSPITALIZED.  IT IS TRUE THAT AT FIRST
THERE WAS A MIXUP IN THE HOSPITAL OVER RUSSIAN NAMES -- IT TOOK THE DOCTORS
A WHILE TO WORK OUT WHICH PHOTOGRAPH BELONGED TO WHOM.  REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE SOVIET EMBASSY AND CONSULATE CAME TO THEIR AID.  ON THE SAME DAY SKILLED
OPERATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT ON ALL THOSE WHO REQUIRED THEM.  THE IZVESTIYA
CORRESPONDENT WAS OFFICIALLY INFORMED THAT THE SERIOUSLY INJURED SOVIET
SEAMEN WERE OUT OF DANGER.  THEIR FAMILIES HAD BEEN INFORMED.

   THE PERUVIAN PRESS BELIEVES THAT THE TERRORIST ACT CARRIED OUT AGAINST
SOVIET CITIZENS WAS THE WORK OF THE MAOIST-INCLINED LEFTIST ARMED GROUPING
"SENDERO LUMINOSO."  BUT THERE IS ANOTHER VERSION:  IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
CARRIED OUT BY ULTRARIGHTISTS OPPOSING THE FISHING AGREEMENTS SIGNED BETWEEN
PERU AND THE USSR.

THIRTYTHREE SOVIET SEAMEN HAVE BEEN INJURED IN THE PERUVIAN PORT OF
CALLAO AS A RESULT OF AN EXPLOSION CAUSED BY A BOMB PLANTED UNDER A
BUS STANDING IN THE STREET.

   OUR CORRESPONDENT TELEPHONED THE USSR MINISTRY OF THE FISH INDUSTRY AND
ASKED FOR INFORMATION ON THE INCIDENT.

   "IT HAPPENED ON 5 JULY AT 1010 HOURS LOCAL TIME," S. SVINARENKO, DEPUTY
CHIEF OF THE USSR MINISTRY OF THE FISH INDUSTRY FOREIGN RELATIONS
ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT, SAID.  "SIXTEEN SEAMEN HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED.
FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY HURT.  THE SEAMEN MAINLY SUFFERED
FRACTURES, CUTS, AND BURNS.  THE VICTIMS WERE MEMBERS OF THE CREWS OF TWO
LARGE, AUTONOMOUS TRAWLERS -- THE 'VLADIMIR KURASOV' AND THE 'LAZURNYY' --
WHO WERE ON SHORE LEAVE THAT DAY.

   "OUR SEAMEN ARE WORKING IN THIS REGION ON THE BASIS OF AN AGREEMENT ON
COOPERATION BETWEEN PERU AND THE SOVIET UNION.  WE ASSIST THE PERUVIANS IN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR FISHING INDUSTRY, GET OUR SHIPS REPAIRED IN LOCAL
PORTS, AND FISH WITHIN A 200-MILE ZONE OF THAT COUNTRY...."

   REUTER AND AFP HAVE REPORTED THAT, IN THE OPINION OF THE CALLAO POLICE,
THE EXPLOSION WAS ORGANIZED BY THE "SENDERO LUMINOSO," A REBEL GROUP OF
MAOIST PERSUASION.  "THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT THIS ACT, WHICH
DESERVES TO BE CONDEMNED, WAS DIRECTED AGAINST TOTALLY INNOCENT CITIZENS,"
PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX SAID.

   THE SOVIET SEAMEN WERE ON A BUS WHICH HAD STOPPED AT A STORE WHEN THE
BOMB, PLANTED UNDER AN EMPTY BUS STANDING NEARBY, WAS DETONATED.

   ACCORDING TO EYE WITNESSES, FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WEARING SCHOOL UNIFORM WERE
SEEN AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THE EXPLOSION,
PLACING A PACKAGE UNDER THE BUS.  

   "SENDERO LUMINOSO" IS AN EXTREME LEFT-WING REBEL ORGANIZATION WAGING A
GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.  

   "SENDERO LUMINOSO" HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.  IT
BEGAN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980.  SINCE THEN, PERU HAS KNOWN NO PEACE.
REPORTS OF MURDERS AND ACTS OF SABOTAGE COMMITTED BY THIS ORGANIZATION ARE
APPEARING WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN THE WORLD PRESS.  THE TERRORISTS'
VICTIMS ARE POLITICIANS, MEMBERS OF THE POLICE FORCE, SOLDIERS,
PEASANTS....  THE TERRORISTS OFTEN INVOLVE JUVENILES IN THEIR ACTS OF
SABOTAGE.

   THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORCED TO RELY MORE AND MORE EXTENSIVELY
ON THE ARMED FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.

   BOGOTA, 10 JUL 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] AFTER SPENDING 130 DAYS ABROAD,
BERNARDO JARAMILLO, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFT-WING PATRIOTIC UNION (UP),
RETURNED TO COLOMBIA TODAY TO URGE THE CASTROITE ARMY OF NATIONAL
LIBERATION (ELN) TO JOIN THE PEACE PROCESS BEING PROMOTED BY THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT.  

   JARAMILLO, A 35-YEAR-OLD LEGISLATOR, REPLACED JAIME PARDO LEAL AS UP
PRESIDENT AFTER PARDO LEAL WAS ASSASSINATED IN OCTOBER 1987.  JARAMILLO HAD
LEFT THE COUNTRY AFTER RECEIVING MANY DEATH THREATS.

   THE ELN IS THE ONLY COLOMBIAN SUBVERSIVE GROUP THAT REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE
PEACE PROPOSALS FORMULATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO
AND INSTEAD HAS INCREASED ITS ATTACKS ON THE COUNTRY'S PETROLEUM
INSTALLATIONS TO DEMAND THE NATIONALIZATION OF THAT INDUSTRY.

   JARAMILLO ASKED THE ELN TO STOP ITS VIOLENT ACTIONS, WHICH, HE SAID, DO
NOT IN ANY WAY BENEFIT COLOMBIA.  

   THE LEFTIST LEADER SAID HE IS WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL
DEVELOPMENT AND ADDED THAT "THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS
IMPROVED."

   THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION, HE SAID, HAS BEGUN TO TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT
CITIZENS.

   "MORE SECURITY MEASURES ARE NEEDED, BUT SOME MEASURES ARE BEING ADOPTED,"
JARAMILLO SAID.  HE STRESSED THAT IF ALL THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS DECIDE TO
HOLD A SINCERE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE, IT WOULD BE VERY POSITIVE FOR THE COUNTRY.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 13 JUL 89 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
COLONEL ERIC SANCHEZ, COMMANDER OF 4TH INFANTRY BATTALION, BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [SANCHEZ] GOOD MORNING, HRN [VOZ DE
HONDURAS] LISTENERS.  I AM A BIT CONCERNED OVER WHAT I HAVE HEARD ON
THIS RADIO STATION.  THE TRUTH IS THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 0030 TODAY,
THERE WAS AN ATTACK WITH A HOMEMADE BOMB IN LA CEIBA, AND, AS A
RESULT, SEVEN U.S.  SOLDIERS -- NOT SIX -- WERE WOUNDED.  FOUR
SUSTAINED VERY MINOR INJURIES, WHILE THREE WERE SOMEWHAT SERIOUSLY
WOUNDED, BUT THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER OF DYING.  NINE SOLDIERS WERE IN
THAT GROUP.  THEY WERE NOT ON LEAVE; THEY WERE ON A MISSION FROM THE
ENRIQUE SOTO CANO HONDURAN AIR BASE AT PALMEROLA.

   THEY PROVOKED...  [CHANGES THOUGHT].  INSTEAD, I SHOULD SAY THAT
THEY WENT TO HAVE SOME FUN AT THE DILIDO DISCOTEQUE. OUR MILITARY POLICE
PATROLS WERE IN THE AREA AND SAW THE ATTACK.  WE CAPTURED TWO SUSPECTS.  OUR
MEN WERE ABOUT 100 METERS AWAY WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED, AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
THE TWO SUSPECTS ARE U.S.  CITIZENS.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WERE IN THE
AREA AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.  THIS IS AN OFFICIAL REPORT; THIS
IS WHAT TOOK PLACE IN LA CEIBA.  THE TWO SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED, AND THEY
MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE SEVEN WHO WERE WOUNDED, WHO ARE AT THE [WORD
INDISTINCT] HOSPITAL.  WHAT YOU REPORTED OVER THE RADIO IS CORRECT.  THERE
IS NO NEED TO BE ALARMED.  IT WAS A HOMEMADE BOMB, AND THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED
BY THE SHRAPNEL, CEMENT, AND STONES THAT WERE THROWN INTO THE AIR BY THE
EXPLOSION.  

   HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO DENY A REPORT BY THE MILKMAN FROM [WORD
INDISTINCT], WHO SAID THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN AND IS BEING HELD
HOSTAGE.  THAT IS NOT TRUE.  WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, [WORDS INDISTINCT]
THE PATROLS WERE ALREADY ON THE STREETS AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT.  FUSEP
[THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCE] WAS INSTRUCTED TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS, AND
THEREFORE VEHICLES ENTERING OR LEAVING LA CEIBA WERE STOPPED AND SEARCHED.
THAT IS ALL; STANDSTILL MERELY BECAUSE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
WOUNDED, OR BECAUSE TWO OR THREE ARE CRITICALLY WOUNDED.

   THE CITY MUST FUNCTION NORMALLY.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE INTERESTED IN THE
CONTINUATION OF PRODUCTION.  SO THE MAN FROM [WORD INDISTINCT] WHO CALLED
AND SAID THAT HE WAS LOSING 100,000 LEMPIRAS [AS A RESULT OF THE VEHICLE
SEARCHES] THIS MORNING WAS TELLING A LIE.  WE GAVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
THAT THE INSPECTION OF VEHICLES SHOULD BE CARRIED UNTIL 0500, AND THAT THE
VEHICLES SHOULD NOT BE DETAINED.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, IT WAS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PRESIDENT WHO PROVIDED
THE REPORT AND SAID THAT THE DELIVERY OF MILK HAD BEEN STOPPED.

   [SANCHEZ] WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR HIM -- WHOM I DO NOT KNOW PERSONALLY
-- I MUST SAY THAT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT WE ARE STOPPING VEHICLES [AS HEARD].
WE STOPPED A VERY SMALL WHITE VAN WITH SOME LABORERS IN IT TO SEARCH THE
VAN.  I WAS THERE ON THE HIGHWAY.  THERE WAS NO MILK ON THAT BUS; THERE
WERE PEOPLE ON THAT BUS, AND I MYSELF ALLOWED THEM TO CONTINUE.  I AM
SORRY THAT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS BEEN MISINFORMED.  WE ARE NOT
PARALYZING ACTIVITIES, NOR ARE WE HOLDING THE CITY HOSTAGE.  AS I SAID, WE
ARE TRYING TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND WE HAVE ARRESTED TWO PEOPLE.
WE ARE NOT SURE IF THEY WERE THE ONES WHO PERPETRATED THE ATTACK; WE ARE
NOT SURE OF ANYTHING.  WE ARE MERELY CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND TAKING
PREVENTIVE MEASURES.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, ARE THE TWO MEN YOU HAVE IN CUSTODY THE SAME U.S.
CITIZENS YOU MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS REPORT?

   [SANCHEZ] YES.  THE LIEUTENANT IN CHARGE OF THE PATROL [WORDS INDISTINCT]
THE PANTS, CLOTHES, AND THE COLOR OF WHAT THEY WERE WEARING INDICATED THAT
THEY WERE CIVILIANS.  LIEUTENANT SALGADO OF THE 4TH BATTALION WAS 50 METERS
AWAY WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED.  TWO PERSONS WERE CAPTURED.  HOWEVER, THEY
HAVE DENIED THAT EITHER OF THEM WAS INVOLVED.  THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  WE
HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES FOR THE ARMED FORCES INVESTIGATIVE
PERSONNEL TO ARRIVE TO LEARN THE IDENTITIES OF THE TWO MEN WHO ARE BEING
HELD.  THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE COMPLETELY PROFESSIONAL.  WE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] TWO OR THREE PERSONS WERE INJURED.  WE ARE NOT PARALYZING
PRODUCTION; I WANT TO MADE THIS CLEAR.

   [REPORTER] YES, OF COURSE.  COLONEL, GIVEN THE SITUATION, DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT THE SITUATION IN THE ARMED FORCES IS COMPLETELY NORMAL?

   [SANCHEZ] OF COURSE IT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL.  WE ARE NOT RESTRICTING
ANYONE'S FREEDOM.  WHEN IT GETS DARK, WE WILL PROCEED TO ASK FOR
IDENTIFICATION PAPERS; WE WILL STOP AND CHECK VEHICLES, WHICH IS NORMAL IN
THIS TYPE OF SITUATION.  HOWEVER, AT NO TIME WILL WE PARALYZE PRODUCTION OR
NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES.  WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE CULPRITS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS ATTACK.  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST U.S.  CITIZENS,
IT WAS CERTAINLY AN ATTACK AGAINST PEACE AND ORDER.  WE THEREFORE HAVE TO
INVESTIGATE IT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT INVOLVED U.S.  CITIZENS.  IN
THIS CASE, AND IN VIEW OF THIS SITUATION, I PERSONALLY ISSUED ORDERS AND
FOLLOWED THE INVESTIGATION UNTIL 0500, WHEN I SUSPENDED ALL OPERATIONS.  I
PERSONALLY ORDERED THESE MEASURES.  I AM AMAZED THAT THE CATTLEMEN DO NOT
TRANSPORT MILK BEFORE 0500.

   [REPORTER] ONE LAST QUESTION ON THIS MATTER:  IS THE SITUATION IN LA
CEIBA RELATED TO THE LATEST VIOLENT INCIDENTS IN SAN PEDRO SULA?

   [SANCHEZ] I BELIEVE SO.  A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS HAS BEEN LAUNCHED
AGAINST SOCIAL PEACE IN HONDURAS.  THIS STATION'S LISTENERS AND LISTENERS OF
ALL OTHER HONDURAN RADIO STATIONS KNOW THE HIGH - CALIBER OF THE ARMED
FORCES PERSONNEL, BEGINNING WITH THE TOP COMMANDERS AND CONTINUING WITH
OFFICERS DOWN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.  WE ARE SENSITIVE TO SOCIAL ISSES AND
ARE NOT MOTIVATED BY VESTED INTERESTS OF ANY KIND.  I BELIEVE THAT THESE
ACTS OF BLOODSHED, WHICH ARE [WORDS INDISTINCT], ARE PART OF A SERIES OF
FULLY PLANNED, COLDLY CALULATED ACTIONS.

   I DO NOT WANT TO SOUND LIKE A COMIC STRIP CHARACTER, BUT I BELIEVE THAT
THESE ACTIONS ARE CONNECTED AND OVERLAP.  I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  WE ARE WITNESSING THE EMERGENCE OF THE SO-CALLED WHITE HANDS
AND BLACK HANDS [DEATH SQUADS], WHICH CONCERN US VERY MUCH.  WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT HONDURANS KILLING HONDURANS.  

   [REPORTER] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO THIS STATION.  WE
WILL BE CONTACTING YOU DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO LEARN THE RESULTS OF THE
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS HOMEMADE BOMB ATTACK IN LA CEIBA.

   [SANCHEZ] WE ARE COMPLETELY AT YOUR SERVICE.  WE ARE WILLING TO OFFER YOU
INFORMATION AS IT COMES IN.  WE ARE A COMPLETELY OPEN, NOT CLOSED,
ORGANIZATION.  WE WILL GIVE YOU TRUTHFUL, FACTUAL INFORMATION FOR THE
BENEFIT OF ALL HONDURANS.  

   [REPORTER] THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING, COLONEL.

PATIOTIC UNION COUNCILMAN GONZALO ALVAREZ HENAO IN MEDELLIN.  THE
ATTACK TOOK PLACE IN THE EL PEDREGAL NEIGHBORHOOD, BELLO MUNICIPALITY,
IN THE NORTHERN PART OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT'S CAPITAL CITY.
AUTHORITIES REPORT THAT ALL THOSE KILLED BELONGED TO A GROUP OF HIRED
ASSASSINS.  TWO POLICEMEN WERE AMONG THOSE KILLED.  OUR REPORTER LAYS
VARGAS HAS THIS REPORT:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VARGAS] THE ASSAILANTS ARRIVED AT THE COUNCILMAN'S

BODYGUARDS REPELLED THE ASSAILANTS AND THE COUNCILMAN ESCAPED UNHARMED.  A
POLICE PATROL IN THE AREA HEARD THE SHOOTOUT AND HELPED SEARCH FOR THE
ASSAILANTS.  THE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN THE AREA BETWEEN THE EL PEDREGAL
AND LA CABANA NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE AREA BETWEEN MEDELLIN AND BELLO.

   THE PAID ASSASSINS CLASHED WITH AUTHORITIES FOR ALMOST 3 HOURS IN
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE NORTHWESTERN COMMUNITY.  SOME OF THE ASSAILANTS
SOUGHT REFUGE IN A LA CABANA NEIGHBORHOOD HOME.  THE POLICE ARRIVED AT THE

BENI PEOPLE ARE PERIODICALLY SUFFERING RETALIATORY ATTACKS BY UMOPAR
[MOBILE UNITS FOR RURAL AREAS] AND DEA AGENTS, WHO ARE ACTIVELY
ENGAGED IN REPRESSIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POLULATION, NOT
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS."  ANEZ MADE THESE REMARKS WHILE COMMENTING
ON LAST WEEK'S INCIDENTS IN SANTA ANA DE YACUMA.

   ANEZ CHARGED THAT THE ATTACKS ARE PERPETRATED AGAINST "OPEN, PEACEFUL
CIVILIANS; THAT IS, AGAINST CITIZENS WHO ARE IN NO WAY INVOLVED IN THE DRUG
TRADE.  NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE MURDERED OR HARASSED IN WAYS NOT IN KEEPING
WITH THE DEMOCRATIC ATMOSPHERE THAT SHOULD PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY."

   ANEZ SAID THE PEOPLE OF SANTA ANA ARE RESTLESS AND THAT ALL BENI
DEPARTMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALERT TO DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT ASSUME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RECENT INCIDENTS.

   ANEZ ANNOUNCED THAT, AS LEADER OF THE BENI CONGRESSIONAL BLOC, HE SENT A
LETTER TO PRESIDENT VICTOR PAZ ESTENSSORO IN WHICH HE OUTLINES THE ISSUE THE
GOVERNMENT MUST ADDRESS TO PREVENT FURTHER CLASHES BETWEEN CIVILIANS AND
SECURITY FORCES.

   ANEZ SAID THE GOVERNMENT MUST ADDRESS THE ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE IN BENI
DEPARTMENT FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND INTERNATIONAL
STANDPOINTS BECAUSE THE DRUG TRADE GOES BEYOND BENI BORDERS; IT IS AN
INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY THAT HAS BUILT AN ECONOMIC EMPIRE FAR MORE POWERFUL
THAN THE BENI PEOPLE, ALL BOLIVIANS, AND THAN THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT ITSELF.

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 JUL 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [EXCERPTS] THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BANNED ENTRANCE INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF EL
SALVADOR CAMPUS AND ARE THREATENING TO FIRE ON ANYONE WHO DISOBEYS
THIS ORDER.  THIS AFTERNOON, THE ARMY ALLOWED NEITHER VEHICLES NOR
STUDENTS TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.  ACCORDING TO MILITARY
OFFICIALS, ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SHOOT ANYONE WHO DISOBEYED BY
ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.  THE MEASURE WENT INTO
EFFECT AT 1730.  THE SITUATION GREW TENSE WHEN PRIVATE CARS ATTEMPTED
TO ENTER THE CAMPUS GROUNDS.

   UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS MET WITH THE MILITARY.  ACCORDING TO THE ARMED
FORCES HIGH COMMAND, SINCE 23 DECEMBER 1988, THE MILITARY HAS NOT ALLOWED
WEAPONS TO BE INTRODUCED INTO OR TAKEN OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.  THE
DISCUSSION ON WHETHER TO ALLOW THE ENTRANCE OF STUDENTS AND VEHICLES BECAME
HEATED.  UNIVERSITY GENERAL MANAGER MARIO ALFREDO CABRERA SAID THAT THIS
MEASURE IS INTENDED TO SHUT DOWN THE UNIVERSITY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CABRERA] ALL OF THIS FALLS UNDER THE GENERAL CAMPAIGN
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AGGRESSION AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY TO MINIMIZE ITS AUTHORITY
IN LIGHT OF ITS ROLE AS THE GOVERNMENT'S AND THE NATION'S CONSCIENCE, WHICH
OFFICIALS -- WHO ARE NOT LEADING THE COUNTRY ALONG THE CORRECT PATH -- DO
NOT LIKE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE BASIC REASON BEHIND THIS AND OTHER
MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES INCLUDE HELICOPTERS OVERFLYING THE CAMPUS AT VERY
LOW ALTITUDES AND SOLDIERS THREATENING TO SHOOT TO KILL IF THE ORDER IS
DISOBEYED.  [END RECORDING]

   SINCE THE MILITARY BLOCKADE WENT INTO EFFECT, SALVADORAN AIR FORCE
HELICOPTERS HAVE BEEN OVERFLYING THE CAMPUS.

   CLANDESTINE, 15 JUL 89 (RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION,
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THIS IS OUR WAR BULLETIN FROM THE MODESTO RAMIREZ
CENTRAL FRONT IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.

   ON 15 JULY, GUERRILLAS BEGAN THE OPERATION CALLED WE WILL DEFEAT ARENA'S
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] DICTATORSHIP BY HITTING THE PUPPET
ARMY.  THIS OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT AGAINST TWO POSITIONS OF THE 4TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE'S AZMITIA BATTALION STATIONED IN CHALATENANGO,
SPECIFICALLY AGAINST AN IRA [INSTITUTE OF SUPPLY REGULATION] CENTER IN SAN
JOSE EL CARAO, EL PARAISO.  THIS IS HOW THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT:

   SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT ON THREE OF THE ARMY'S FORTIFIED
PERIPHERAL DEFENSE POSITIONS.  ONE OF THESE POSITIONS WAS COMPLETELY
DESTROYED, RESULTING IN 11 OF THE ENEMY KILLED.  FOUR ADDITIONAL CASUALTIES
WERE INFLICTED ON THE ENEMY IN THE THREE OTHER DEFENSE FORTIFICATIONS, WHICH
WERE ALSO DESTROYED.

   WE ALSO ATTACKED THE MAIN SUPPLY CENTER FACILITIES AND STORMED THREE
DEFENSIVE POSITIONS IN THE INTERIOR.  AS A RESULT OF THIS ATTACK, FOUR OF
THE ENEMY WERE KILLED AND FIVE WERE WOUNDED.  IN ADDITION, WE DESTROYED THE
OFFICES AND A GRAIN DRYER AND DAMAGED THE STORAGE BINS AND GRAIN STORAGE
AREAS.  WE CONCLUDED THE ATTACK BY SETTING THE ENTIRE FACILITY ON FIRE.

   THE FOLLOWING MILITARY EQUIPMENT WAS SEIZED FROM THE ENEMY DURING THIS
VICTORIOUS OPERATION:  3 M-16 RIFLES, 3 FULL SETS [NOT FURTHER
IDENTIFIED], 1 M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHER WITH 9 GRENADES, 550 5.56-MM ROUNDS OF
AMMUNITION, 2 100-CARTRIDGE M-60 AMMUNITION BELTS, UNIFORMS, BOOTS, AND
OTHER MILITARY SUPPLIES.

   ONE HOUR AFTER THE ATTACK BEGAN, THE ENEMY WAS REINFORCED BY A
ROCKET-FIRING HELICOPTER, ONE PUSH-PULL O-2 AIRCRAFT, AND ONE C-47
AIRCRAFT.  IN ADDITION, THE ENEMY RECEIVED ARTILLERY SUPPORT FROM THE AREAS
ABOVE THE INSTALLATIONS UNDER ATTACK, BUT THIS FIRE AND THE AIR SUPPORT WERE
INEFFECTIVE.  THE C-47 AIRCRAFT STRAFED LAS PENAS, WITH COMPLETE DISREGARD
FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, A REPRESSIVE ACTION WE VEHEMENTLY DENOUNCE.

   LATER, AT 0300, THE ENEMY TROOPS WERE REINFORCED BY TWO ARMORED PERSONNEL
CARRIERS AND FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS, WHICH TOOK TROOPS TO A PLACE NEAR THE IRA
INSTALLATION.  THESE REINFORCEMENTS WERE QUICKLY NEUTRALIZED BY OUR RIFLE
FIRE.  IN ADDITION, THE OPERATION INCLUDED A LARGE NUMBER OF MILITIAMEN AND
REBEL TROOPS, WHO ERECTED ROADBLOCKS ON THE STREETS OF NUEVA CONCEPCION,
BLEW UP SIX TELEPHONE POSTS, PLACED A LARGE BANNER ACROSS THE STREET, AND
DISTRIBUTED PROPAGANDA.  OTHER PROPAGANDA ACTIVITIES OCCURRED IN SAN JOSE
PATARES, LA SIEMBRE, GUAYABITO, AND HORCONES IN LA PALMA JUSRISDICTION.

   IN ALL, WE INFLICTED 24 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING DEAD AND WOUNDED, ON THE
4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE; HOWEVER, WE LOST COMRADE OTONIEL IN THE ATTACK.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ABOUT A RANSOM?  HAS THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT BEEN
CONTACTED?

   [LOPEZ] THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT.  WE ARE HOPING THERE WILL BE A CONTACT
SO THAT WE CAN PROCEED FROM THERE.

   [REPORTER] IS IT TRUE A RANSOM HAS BEEN DEMANDED?

   [LOPEZ] I HAVE NO PROOF OF THAT.  I DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT
HAS RECEIVED?

   [LOPEZ] WE WERE BRIEFED ON THE WORK BEING COORDINATED WITH THE COLOMBIAN
AUTHORITIES.  WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM, LIKE BROTHERS.  THE TWO
ARMIES AND THE AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER.

   [REPORTER] IF A RANSOM IS DEMANDED, IS THE GOVERNMENT WILLING TO PAY IT?

   [LOPEZ] I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION; THAT WOULD DEPEND ON RODRIGUEZ'
FAMILY.

   [REPORTER] THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH
KIDNAPPINGS.  WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT THIS CASE?  WHAT DO THEY THINK THE
OUTCOME WILL BE?

   [LOPEZ] WE ALWAYS WORK BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR CASES.  THIS
KIDNAPPING COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE REBELS, AND WE ALREADY KNOW
HOW THE REBELS OPERATE.  HE ALSO COULD HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY COMMON
CRIMINALS.  EVEN THOUGH IT MAY SEEM THAT THE CASE WOULD BE HANDLED SIMILARLY
IN BOTH INSTANCES, IT IS NOT SO.  WE ARE GOING TO WAIT A BIT LONGER.  WE
BELIEVE WE MAY GET MORE INFORMATION TODAY.

   [REPORTER] IT IS NOT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT POLICY TO PAY RANSOM IN CASES
SUCH AS THIS ONE.  WILL AN EXCEPTION BE MADE IN THIS CASE?

   [LOPEZ] I BELIEVE WE SHOULD FOLLOW OUR POLICY.  THERE ARE MEANS THAT CAN
BE USED TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING; THIS WOULD HAPPEN ONCE WE HAVE SPECIFIC
INFORMATION.

   ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, THE STUDENTS HELD A DEMONSTRATION LATE IN THE

AREA AND RELEASE STUDENTS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED.

   AFTER THE DEMONSTATION ENDED, EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD AND SOLDIERS BEGAN

[TEXT] INTERIOR MINISTER CARLOS CACERES TODAY STATED THAT THE
GANG-STYLE ACTION AKEN YESTERDAY BY SOME PEOPLE TO OCCUPY PRIVATE
PROPERTY WILL NOT INTIMIDATE THE GOVERNMENT.

   [BEGIN CACERES RECORDING] YESTERDAY, A WELL-ORGANIZED GROUP OF
APPROXIMATELY 300 PEOPLE ATTEMPTED TO USURP PRIVATE PROPERTY USING MOLOTOV
COCKTAILS, STONES AND FIREARMS.  THEIR ACTION CAUSED ONE UNFORTUNATE DEATH,
INJURIES, AND DAMAGE -- WHICH WERE REPORTED EARLIER -- TO THE DETRIMENT OF A
LARGE NUMBER OF POOR FAMILIES.

   IT IS PUBLICLY EVIDENT THAT THE COMMUNISTS AND THEIR CLOSEST ALLIES WERE
BEHIND THE PREPARATION, COORDINATION AND EXECUTION OF THESE CRIMINALS
ACTIONS.

   UNFORTUNATELY, ONE CANNOT FAIL TO LINK THESE ACTIONS TO THE THREATENING,
VIOLENT SPEECHES -- FOLLOWING THE STYLE USED BY THE POPULAR UNITY MEMBERS --
WITH WHICH SOME LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION COALITION OPENED THE ELECTORAL
CAMPAIGN OF THEIR CANDIDATE PATRICIO AYLWIN.

   IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE TO REGARD THESE AGGRESSIONS AS SIGNALS AND WARNINGS
OF THE INCONSISTENCIES AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN SOME POLITICAL
UMBRELLA GROUPS.  THESE GROUPS CONSIST OF SECTORS ADVOCATING A PEACEFUL
DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE ON THE ONE HAND, AND OTHER SECTORS THAT FOLLOW THE
LINE OF THOSE WHO IN THE PAST DESTROYED OUR TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE ON THE
OTHER HAND.

   ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS STATED ITS DECISION NOT TO GET INVOLVED IN
THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, IT CANNOT FAIL TO ANNOUNCE ITS POSITION AND TO STATE
ITS OUTRIGHT REJECTION OF A MALICIOUS AND DEMAGOGICAL RHETORIC THAT POSES A
THREAT TO PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE GOVERNMENT YIELD TO THOSE WHO TIME AND
AGAIN SEEK AND PROMOTE SUBVERSION AND TO DISRUPT OUR DEMOCRATIC
INSTITUTIONAL ORDER. [END RECORDING]

   2. THE CLASHES THAT OCCURRED NEAR THE UNIVERSITY WERE CARRIED OUT BY

THIS PLAN IS BEING CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER
OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE.  THE PLAN INVOLVES THREATS, ARRESTS, MURDERS,

   4. IT IS PREDICTABLE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE TOP COMMAND OF

RESULT OF A CLASH BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE FMLN, AND THIS IS COMPLETELY
FALSE.  CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
