   SAN SALVADOR, 2 APR 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE
REPORTED THAT FIVE POLICEMEN AND A CIVILIAN WERE KILLED, AND AT LEAST
24 SOLDIERS INJURED WHEN A VEHICLE LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES EXPLODED ON
2 APRIL NEAR A POLICE PRECINCT LOCATED ON THE SOUTHWESTERN OUTSKIRTS
OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) CONFIRMED THAT THE
TERRORIST ATTACK OCCURRED AT 0615 (1315 GMT) [AS RECEIVED] ON MONDAY
IN SANTA TECLA, 12 KM FROM THE CAPITAL.

   THE OFFICIAL REPORT REVEALS THAT A COMPANY OF POLICEMEN FROM THE
TECHNICAL POLICE INSTRUCTION CENTER, AN AGENCY OF THE NATIONAL POLICE,
WAS EXERCISING NEAR THE PRECINCT WHEN A POWERFUL EXPLOSIVE CHARGE IN A
PICK-UP TRUCK WENT OFF AS THE POLICEMAN WENT BY.  A COPREFA SPOKESMAN
HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PROBABLY ACTIVATED BY REMOTE
CONTROL BY A GUERRILLA UNIT.

PRESIDENTS DANIEL ORTEGA SAAVEDRA, OSCAR ARIAS SANCHEZ, RAFAEL
LEONARDO CALLEJAS, MARCO VINICIO CEREZO AREVELO, ALFREDO CRISTIANI:

   IN EL SALVADOR A SERIOUS DIALOGUE-NEGOTIATION PROCESS HAS BEGUN
THANKS TO THE MEDIATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS THROUGH ITS SECRETARY
GENERAL MR. JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR.  THIS IMPLIES THAT ANY PEACE
FORMULA MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THIS NEGOTIATION PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT
IT IS BASED ON OUR PARTICULAR REALITY AND THE GUARANTEES OFFERED BY
THIS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THE NEGOTIATION'S MAIN OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE THE
COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION, BECAUSE WHILE PEACEFUL CENTRAL AMERICAN AND
WORLD DEVELOPMENTS ARE MARKED BY A CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY, EL
SALVADOR IS QUITE FAR FROM EXPERIENCING THIS.

   THE ARMY HOLDS SOCIETY'S REAL POWER.  THIS PREVENTS JUSTICE BEING
APPLIED IN THE HORRENDOUS ASSASSINATIONS OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, JESUIT
PRIESTS, FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION]
MEMBERS, AND DR. HECTOR OQUELI.  UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS, IMPUNITY
CONTINUES TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ENFORCE
RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.

   DAILY LIFE IS MARKED BY REPRESSION AGAINST THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AN
FREQUENT MURDERS, WHILE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]
APPLIES PRESSURES AND FORCES, BY VARIOUS MEANS, THE RESTRICTION OF
INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA BY LIMITING FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

   IT IS THEREFORE EVIDENT THAT EL SALVADOR IS THE COUNTRY THAT HAS
FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE MAIN GOALS OF ESQUIPULAS II -- THE
ACHIEVEMENT OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND A
NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   THIS SITUATION, WHICH IS ACCOMPANIED BY A PERMANENT STATE OF SIEGE
IS WORSENED BY GREAT RESTRICTIONS ON THE POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT PREVENT
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILIAN SOCIETY.

   IT SUFFICES TO MENTION THE CASE OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM: IN
NICARAGUA, A COUNTRY WITH HALF OF OUR COUNTRY'S POPULATION, THE
SUPREME ELECTORAL COUNCIL REGISTERED 1.9 MILLION CITIZENS IN ONLY FOUR
SUNDAYS; IN EL SALVADOR, IN EIGHT YEARS, THE ELECTORAL REGISTRY
REGISTERED 1.6 MILLION CITIZENS FOR THE RECENT ELECTIONS AND ONLY 1
MILLION ACTUALLY VOTED.  [CONTINUED]

MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] IN CONTRAST, EL SALVADOR, WHICH HAS THE SECOND LARGEST
POPULATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS THE SMALLEST PARLIAMENT WITH ONLY
60 DEPUTIES.

   THE SOCIAL CONFLICT IS WORSENED BY A WAR THAT NO ONE HAS WON.  THE
TIME HAS COME TO LET CIVILIAN SOCIETY WIN.  TO ACHIEVE THAT WE
REQUIRE:

   -- THE PURGING, RESTRUCTURING, AND REDUCTION OF THE ARMY AND
MOVEMENT TOWARD A CIVILIAN SOCIETY, AN ABSOLUTELY DEMILITARIZED
SOCIETY.

   -- THE END OF IMPUNITY THROUGH THE TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF THE
MASTERMINDS AND PERPETRATORS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR ROMERO,
FENASTRAS MEMBERS, JESUIT PRIESTS, AND DR. OQUELI.  THESE TRIALS ARE
THE FOUNDATION THAT WILL ENSURE THAT REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS
CREDIBLE.

   -- GUARANTEES OF THE FRAMEWORK OF DEMOCRATIC LIBERTIES.

   -- VIA A PLESBICITE IN THE 1991 ELECTIONS, THAT THE NEXT ASSEMBLY
IMPLEMENT AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION, SUCH AS THE EXPANSION OF THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY AND THE CREATION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
FOR THE DEMILITARIZATION OF SOCIETY.

   -- REFORM OF THE ELECTORAL SYTEM TO REGISTER, BY MAY THIS YEAR AT
THE LATEST, NEARLY 3 MILLION ELIGIBLE SALVADORAN VOTERS TO ALLOW THEM
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 1991 ELECTIONS.

   -- THE CARRYING OUT OF THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS WITHOUT A MILITARY
PRESENCE AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AT
LEAST SIX MONTHS BEFORE AND UNTIL THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW
ASSEMBLY.

   THE FMLN IS WILLING TO REACH ACCORDS ON ALL THESE ISSUES AND TO
IMPLEMENT SIMULTANEOUS STEPS FROM A DE-INTENSIFICATION OF THE WAR AND
AN END OF HOSTILITIES TO ACCORDS TO END THE ARMED CONFLICT AND THE
REINCORPORATION OF OUR FORCES INTO POLITICAL LIFE IN KEEPING WITH AND
PARALLEL TO THE AFOREMENTIONED MEASURES TAKING PLACE.

   WE EXPRESS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FULLY SUPPORT A NATIONAL REGISTRATIO
DRIVE TO GIVE ALL ELIGIBLE SALVADORAN VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE
AND CONTRIBUTE TOWARD ENSURING THAT THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS, AS WAS THE
CASE IN NICARAGUA, WILL HELP ESTABLISH THE BASES FOR LASTING PEACE.

   PRESIDENTS: THE FMLN'S OBJECTIVES ARE DEMOCRATIZATION, RESPECT FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS, ESTABLISHMENT OF A GENUINE LEGAL STATE,
DEMILITARIZATION, AND ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY AS
THE ONLY MEANS TO ENSURE THAT OUR PEOPLE WILL PEACEFULLY MOVE UP TO
BETTER LEVELS OF WELL-BEING AND DEVELOPMENT.  IN THIS REGARD, WE
BELIEVE THAT YOUR BEST CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE TO HELP PROMOTE
DEMOCRATIZATION IN EL SALVADOR AND TO ADVOCATE A NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS
THAT IS BEGUN AT THE UNITED NATIONS.

FRANCISCO JOVEL, SHAFICK JORGE HANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, AND JOAQUIN
VILLALOBOS.

   BOGOTA, 31 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [REPORT] [JUAN JORGE FAUNDES] [TEXT]
KIDNAPPING IS ONE OF COLOMBIA'S MOST PROFITABLE INDUSTRIES TO THE
EXTENT THAT, ACCORDING TO POLICE STATISTICS, FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
KIDNAPPED EVERY DAY SO FAR IN 1990, A FIGURE DOUBLE THAT OF THE SAME
PERIOD IN 1989.  THE JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS DIRECTORATE
[DIJIN] THIS WEEK REPORTED THAT 326 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED FOR
EXTORTION PURPOSES SO FAR THIS YEAR.

   DIJIN SAID THAT THE NUMBER OF KIDNAPPINGS IN THIS PERIOD DOUBLED
THE NUMBER OF KIDNAPPINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 1989.

   ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY [DAS], IN
1989, CATTLEMEN PAID 2 BILLION PESOS ($5 MILLION) TO KIDNAPPERS AND
BLACKMAILERS WHO THREATENED CAPTURING OR ASSASSINATING THEM IF THEY
FAILED TO PAY.

   ACCORDING TO DAS, GUERRILLAS OR CRIMINALS STOLE 10,000 HEAD OF
CATTLE IN 1989 AND HAVE STOLEN 1,500 OF THE ANIMALS SO FAR IN 1990.

   SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE, BOTH POLICE SOURCES AND THOSE WHO STUDY
THE COLOMBIAN REALITY, HAVE POINTED OUT THAT GUERRILLAS PARTICIPATE IN
20 TO 30 PERCENT OF THE KIDNAPPING BUSINESS AND COMMON CRIMINALS IN 70
TO 80 PERCENT.

   THESE PERCENTAGES OF PARTICIPATION IN THE INDUSTRY OF KIDNAPPING
ARE ONLY ESTIMATES NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CHECK BECAUSE IN MANY CASES
GUERRILLAS KIDNAP PEOPLE TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES AND DO NOT CLAIM
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

   IN ADDITION, MANY PEOPLE ARE KIDNAPPED BY COMMON CRIMINALS, BUT THE
CRIME IS REPORTED AS BEING PERPETRATED BY GUERRILLAS IN AN ATTEMPT TO
COVER UP THE MALEFACTOR'S ACTIONS.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS, CORDOBA, IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTHEAST, IS THE
DEPARTMENT MOST AFFECTED BY THIS KIND OF CRIME.  OTHER HARD HIT
DEPARTMENTS ARE ANTIOQUIA IN THE NORTHWEST, SANTANDER IN THE
NORTHEAST, AND CAUCA IN THE SOUTHWEST.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS REPORT, THE SITUATION HAS BECOME SO UNTENABLE
THAT ITS SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESTORE SOCIAL BALANCE IN CORDOBA ON A
MID-TERM BASIS BECAUSE THE POPULATION HAS ACCUSTOMED ITSELF TO
COEXISTING WITH THESE IRREGULARITIES OR REPULSING THEM WITH MECHANISMS
OTHER THAN THOSE STIPULATED BY LAW.

   MECHANISMS OTHER THAN THOSE STIPULATED BY LAW REFERRED TO BY THE
DAS ARE USUALLY CATTLEMEN ORGANIZING THEMSELVES INTO SELF-DEFENSE
PARAMILITARY GROUPS OR DEATH SQUADS.

   THESE PARAMILITARY GROUPS DEFEND THEIR PROPERTIES OR MOUNT RAIDS
AGAINST PEASANTS CONSIDERED ACCOMPLICES OR INFORMANTS OF LEFTIST
GUERRILLAS OR COMMON CRIMINALS WHO BLACKMAIL THEM.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS, ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THIS SITUATION IS SOCIAL
DISRUPTION AND THE PRECARIOUS ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THE COMMUNITIES
LOCATED IN MUNICIPALITIES AND LOCALITIES THAT LACK THE MOST BASIC
SERVICES, A REALITY THAT IS MOST GLARING IN CORDOBA.

   FIVE GUERRILLA GROUPS ARE ACTIVE IN COLOMBIA.  THE MOST BELLIGERENT
AND THE ONE THAT HAS USED KIDNAPPING TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IS THE
PRO-CASTRO NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY [ELN].

   THE OTHER GROUPS ARE THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF
COLOMBIA [FARC], THE MAOIST PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY [EPL], THE
INDIGENIST QUINTIN LAME, AND THE TROTSKYIST REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS'
PARTY [PRT].

   MADRID (SPAIN), 2 APR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE
GUATEMALAN VICE PRESIDENT ARRIVED IN MADRID THIS AFTERNOON.  ON HIS
ARRIVAL HE SPOKE TO OUR CORRESPONDENT, HECTOR ARENAS, AT BARAJAS
AIRPORT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARENAS] GUATEMALAN VICE PRESIDENT ROBERTO CARPIO
WHO IS NOW IN SPAIN SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT SUPORTS THE CONCILIATION
COUNCIL MEETING TAKING PLACE IN OSLO, WHERE TALKS ARE BEING HELD WITH
THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS TO PUT AN END TO THE CLIMATE OF VIOLENCE
WHICH THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING FOR YEARS;
SCORES OF PEOPLE ARE DEAD OR MISSING.  ACCORDING TO VICE PRESIDENT
CARPIO THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION TODAY IN NO WAY JUSTIFIES TERRORIST
ACTIONS OR ARMED MOVEMENTS.

   [CARPIO, IN PROGRESS] ...THIS IS GOOD PROGRESS AND IN THIS
CONNECTION TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR COUNTRIES HAVE CHANGED.  IT IS NOT
THE GUATEMALA OF FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO, WHEN THERE WERE AUTOCRATIC AND
MILITARY REGIMES.  TODAY WE ARE IN A PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND IN
THIS CONNECTION WE ALL OUGHT TO INVOLVE OURSELVES IN IT.  THEREFORE, I
THINK, THIS IS THE BEGINING OF SOMETHING WHICH COULD END THE ARMED
STRUGGLE IN GUATEMALA, AS IT SHOULD ALSO END THROUGHOUT ALL CENTRAL
AMERICA.  [END RECORDING]

   BOGOTA, 3 APR 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] DURING THE
SEARCHES TODAY IN MEDELLIN, THE CAPITAL OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, THE
AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED WHAT THEY HAVE TERMED AS A VERY IMPORTANT
COMMUNICATIONS CENTER OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.

   AS PART OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE OPERATIONS, IN RESPONSE TO THE
ATTACKS AGAINST ARMY MEMBERS IN MEDELLIN, THE AUTHORITIES TODAY
DISMANTLED A COMMUNICATIONS CENTER BELONGING TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.
IN A RESIDENCE LOCATED IN EL POBLADO NEIGHBORHOOD, THE AUTHORITIES
FOUND 15 PORTABLE COMMUNICATION RADIOS; TWO CORDLESS TELEPHONES; TWO
MAGNETIC ANTENNAS FOR RADIOS; THREE ICOM RECEIVERS; SEVEN BATTERIES;
12 ANTENNAS FOR PORTABLE RADIOS; FIVE VOLTAGE REGULATORS; AND FOUR
ADAPTERS.

   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE REPORT, DOCUMENTS LINKING SEVERAL PEOPLE
WITH THE ASSASSINATIONS OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO, BERNARDO
JARAMILLO OSSA, AND OF COLONEL VALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO WERE FOUND
AT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL COMMUNICATIONS CENTER, AS WELL AS DOCUMENTS
ABOUT THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ATTACK ON THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] HEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA, AND AGAINST THE
AVIANCA HK1803 PLANE.  POLICE SOURCES REPORTED THAT NO ARRESTS WERE
MADE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS
OF STAFF, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [EXCERPTS] [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE
POSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES CONCERNING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN
NICARAGUA AND THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE TO BE HELD IN GENEVA BETWEEN THE
REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT?  WILL THE ARMED FORCES SEEK SUPPORT FOR THE
DIALOGUE AND A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT?

   [PONCE] LAST WEEK THE ARMED FORCES RELEASED A PUBLIC MESSAGE TO THE
PEOPLE EXPLAINING THEIR STAND AND MENTIONING THREE BASIC POINTS:

   FIRST, THE ARMED FORCES SUPPORT A DIALOGUE THAT SEEKS PEACE IN THE
COUNTRY THROUGH MECHANISMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT.

   SECOND, THE ARMED FORCES EXPRESS THEIR LOYALTY TO THE PRESIDENT OF
THE REPUBLIC IN THESE EFFORTS AND OTHER EFFORTS HE MAY UNDERTAKE TO
FIND THE PEACE WE ALL CHERISH IN THIS COUNTRY.

   THIRD, WE POSSESS THE MORAL CONVICTION AND THE OBEDIENCE -- AS
ORDERED BY THE CONSTITUTION -- AS WELL AS THE HUMANISTIC AWARENESS TO
PROMOTE AND PROTECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL SALVADORANS.

   THOSE ARE THE BASIC POINTS INCLUDED IN OUR MESSAGE TO THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT WE ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK.

   AS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT BEING HELD IN NICARAGUA, THE ARMED
FORCES WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY OUR GOVERNMENT
TO FIND THE MECHANISMS THAT WILL LEAD US TO PEACE IN THE REGION.  THAT
IS WHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS OUR FULL SUPPORT IN THIS
ENDEAVOUR FOR FINDING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY THROUGHOUT CENTRAL AMERICA.

   CONCERNING THE DIALOGUE IN GENEVA, I BELIEVE THAT TOMORROW THERE
WILL BE A BRIEFING WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF DELEGATES FROM THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
TOGETHER WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO WILL ANNOUNCE THE
MECHANISMS TO BE FOLLOWED IN THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE FMLN.

   [REPORTER] WHAT DO THE ARMED FORCES THINK ABOUT THE EIGHT BOMBS
THAT WERE DETONATED YESTERDAY AND KILLED SIX SOLDIERS AND ONE
CIVILIAN?  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NOW, SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT
EXPLOSIVES ARE AGAIN BEING USED AGAINST THE PEOPLE?

   [PONCE] WE, THE ARMED FORCES, FEEL THAT THESE EVENTS ARE CARRIED
OUT BY THE TERRORISTS WITHIN THE FMLN WHO DO NOT BELIEVE DIALOGUE IS A
MECHANISM FOR ACHIEIVING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.  THESE INDIVIDUALS
BELIEVE THAT VIOLENCE IS WHAT WILL LEAD THEM TO POWER.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1208 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS
OF STAFF, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [EXCERPTS] [CONTINUED] [PONCE]
THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT IN HISTORY.  THEY HAD CLEARLY
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NOT USE CAR BOMBS FROM NOW ON, BUT THEY USED
ONE YESTERDAY NEVERTHELESS.  THIS ACTION IS CONDEMNABLE FROM EVERY
VIEWPOINT BECAUSE THE MEMBERS, RATHER THE ALUMNI, OF CETIPOL [POLICE
INSTRUCTION CENTER] WHO WERE VICTIMS OF THIS ATTACK WERE UNARMED.
THEY WERE SIMPLY DOING SOME PHYSICAL EXERCISES.  IT IS ALSO DEPLORABLE
THAT A BAKER WAS KILLED AND THAT A 12-YEAR-OLD YOUTH GOING TO SCHOOL
WAS INJURED.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EVENTS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE AT ALL TO THE
CREATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE FOR SEEKING PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY.  THIS AND MANY OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH HAVE RECENTLY
OCCURRED CONTRADICT THE IMAGE THAT THE FMLN HAD PREVIOUSLY TRIED TO
CREATE WITH ITS DECISION NOT TO CONTINUE SABOTAGING THE PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS SECTORS, AS WELL AS BUSINESSES.  ALL
THESE ACTIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO OCCUR.  WE WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THESE
ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY TERRORISTS WHO ARE OUT OF THE FMLN
LEADERS' CONTROL, BECAUSE, AS I SAID, THIS DOES NOT HELP AT ALL TO
CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, REFERRING TO THE STATE OF SIEGE, WILL THE ARMED
FORCES INSIST ON KEEPING IT OR NOT?  THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
PRESIDENT COMMENTED ON THIS YESTERDAY.

   [PONCE] THIS IS A POLITICAL DECISION ANYWAY, AND IT IS ADOPTED BY
THE ASSEMBLY -- SOMETIMES UPON REQUEST FROM...

   [REPORTER, INTERRUPTING] THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, YOU SAID.

   [PONCE] WE, AS AN ARMED CORPS AND WITH THE INTENTION OF HELPING
CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE FOR PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY, WILL MAKE
NO REQUEST TO EXTEND THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE ARMED FORCES DECIDED THIS
BECAUSE THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE HAS DISAPPEARED?

   [PONCE] TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT CURRENT VIOLENT ACTIONS
MIGHT COME FROM GROUPS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF FMLN LEADERS, WE BELIEVE
THAT THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION IS NOT NORMAL ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THERE IS
NO VIOLENCE.  HOWEVER, AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THAT PROPITIOUS ATMOSPHERE
FOR THE DIALOGUE, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS ADVISABLE TO LIFT IT.

   [REPORTER] I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS: WHAT IS THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION
REGARDING [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [PONCE] AS FOR THE FIRST QUESTION, YOU ARE REFERRING TO STATEMENTS
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC.  I BELIEVE THAT IN DUE TIME HE WILL
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THOSE STATEMENTS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT
THE NEWSMAN DISTORTED HIS WORDS, BUT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF WILL HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE RESPECTIVE CLARIFICATION.

   I WILL, HOWEVER, STATE THAT ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN
ISSUED BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL POLICE AS TO WHETHER AT
ANY TIME COLONEL BENAVIDES HAS LEFT THE HANDS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE,
HE CLEARLY SAID THAT AT NO TIME HAS BENAVIDES DONE THIS.  HE IS UNDER
THE ORDERS OF THE 4TH PENAL JUDGE, AND AT NO TIME HAS THE 4TH PENAL
JUDGE AUTHORIZED COL. BENAVIDES TO LEAVE THE CONFINES OF THE JAIL.

   THE PERSON WHO MADE THE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD PRESENT SOME EVIDENCE, A
PHOTOGRAPH FOR EXAMPLE.  OTHERWISE, THIS IS ALL MERE SPECULATION.
THAT IS A VERY DELICATE CASE, AND SPECULATIONS CAST A NEGATIVE IMAGE
ON THE ARMED FORCES AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF, AND EVEN ON THE
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY.

   CONCERNING WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE TRIAL OF THE MURDER OF THE
JESUITS, THE JUSTICE AUTHORITIES WILL DETERMINE WHAT WILL BE DONE.  WE
WILL RESPECT THAT DECISION.  [CONTINUED]

APPROXIMATELY 800 HEAVILY ARMED COLOMBIANS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS
WERE DISCOVERED CONDUCTING ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES AT THE BORDER BETWEEN PANAMA
AND COLOMBIA, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT AND JUSTICE MINISTER RICARDO ARIAS
CALDERON.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARIAS CALDERON] THERE ARE COLOMBIANS WITHOUT
IDENTIFICATION AT THE BORDER.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN
ENGAGED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.  THERE WAS AN ATTACK IN PUERTO OBALDIA,
IN WHICH A NATIONAL POLICEMAN WAS KILLED BY SOME COLOMBIAN NATIONALS.
THIS IS BEING INVESTIGATED.  THE COLOMBIAN NATIONALS HAVE NOT YET BEEN
IDENTIFIED.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH INCIDENTS ARE LINKED.  WE ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND THE GOVERNMENT AND JUSTICE MINISTRY WILL TAKE
THE PROPER MEASURES AT THE PROPER TIME.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES THEY ARE
CONDUCTING THERE NOW?

   [ARIAS CALDERON] THEY ARE PROBABLY CONDUCTING CONTRABAND- RELATED
ACTIVITIES. [END RECORDING] 


DEV-MUC3-1210 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 MAR 90 (DIARIO LATINO) -- [TEXT] INTERNATIONAL NEWS
DISPATCHES HAVE REPORTED ON PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S REMARKS ABOUT WHY
THE NEFARIOUS DEATH SQUADS HAVE APPEARED AND STILL THRIVE IN THE COUNTRY.

   CRISTIANI'S REMARKS, MADE IN CARACAS, HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF
CONCERN FOR LOCAL AND FOREIGN OBSERVERS BECAUSE HE USES A STRANGE AND
TWISTED LOGIC TO ANALYZE THE SALVADORAN SOCIAL REALITY.  HE HAS SAID
THAT THE DEATH SQUADS APPEARED IN RESPONSE TO THE FORMATION OF THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  EVEN WORSE, HE SAID
THAT THESE SQUADS WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN OUR COUNTRY AS LONG AS
THE FMLN CONTINUES TO CARRY OUT POLITICAL AND MILITARY ACTIVITIES.

   CRISTIANI'S REMARKS HAVE CALLED THE ATTENTION OF UDN, WHICH CANNOT
HELP BUT REJECT AND REFUTE ASSERTIONS DESIGNED TO CONFUSE THE LOCAL
AND FOREIGN PUBLIC OPINION ON THE TRUE CAUSES OF VIOLENCE IN THE
COUNTRY AND THE FMLN'S APPEARANCE AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE NATIONAL
SCENARIO.

   FIRST, CRISTIANI'S ASSERTIONS REPRESENT MORAL SUPPORT FOR THE
GROUPS AND BANDS OF ASSASSINS WHO, EMBEDDED IN AND PROTECTED BY THE
STRUCTURES OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POWER, HAVE ASSASSINATED WITH
IMPUNITY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOWLY SALVADORANS.

   SECOND, CRISTIANI MISTAKES THE CASE FOR THE EFFECT BY SAYING THAT
"VIOLENCE ENGENDERS VIOLENCE" AND THAT, THEREFORE, THERE WILL BE DEATH
SQUADS AS LONG AS THERE ARE GUERRILLAS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE DEATH
SQUADS WERE ACTIVE EVEN BEFORE THE FMLN WAS ORGANIZED.  HAS CRISTIANI
PERHAPS FORGOTTEN THE ASSASSINATIONS PERPETRATED BY THE WHITE HAND [LA
MANO BLANCA], THE WHITE WAR UNION [LA UNION GUERRA BLANCA], AND OTHER
GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN SPREADING TERROR FOR MANY YEARS?

   THIRD, VIOLENCE AND HOSTILITY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT IN EL
SALVADOR SINCE THE SPANISH INVASION AND CONQUEST AND WORKERS HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN FAVORITE VICTIMS.

   WE HEREBY STATE THIS, FULLY COGNIZANT OF THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY.
THE VIOLENCE OF THE PEOPLE HAS RESPONDED, AS A LAST DITCH RESORT, TO
THE GENERALIZED VIOLENCE OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND STATE.

   LET US KEEP IN MIND OUR FOREBEARS' RESISTANCE TO THE SPANISH
INVADERS; THE PEASANTS' AND INDIANS' PERSISTENT REBELLION AGAINST THE
SOCIAL INJUSTICE OF COLONIAL TIMES; THE HEROIC ACTIONS AND THE
PATRIOTIC ATTEMPTS THAT CULMINATED IN INDEPENDENCE; ANASTASIO AQUINO'S
REBELLION; THE PEASANTS' AND INDIANS' RESISTANCE TO WORKING FOR THE
NEW LANDOWNERS WHO DISPOSSESSED THEM OF THEIR COMMON LANDS DURING THE
1881 AGRARIAN REFORM; THE REBELLION OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS IN 1932;
THE HISTORIC ACTION AGAINST DICTATOR MARTINEZ IN 1944; THE RANK AND
FILE STRUGGLE AGAINST TYRANT LEMUS; THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE AGAINST THE
ELECTORAL IMPOSITION IN THE 1970'S; AND THE UNYIELDING STRUGGLE OF AN
ENTIRE PEOPLE FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE, WHICH IS
CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1211 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN
COMMANDER SANCHO BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[REPORTER] COMMANDER, THE FIGHTERS, EVEN SALVADORAN CITIZENS IN
GENERAL, DO NOT UNDERSTAND CERTAIN ATTITUDES OF THE FMLN OR SOME OF
THE COMMUNIQUES ISSUED BY THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND.  WE SPENT EIGHT OR
NINE YEARS FIGHTING THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] AND JOSE
NAPOLEON DUARTE.  WE REMEMBER [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ASSASSINATION OF
HERBERT ANAYA SANABRIA.  HOWEVER, WHEN DUARTE DIED, A COMMUNIQUE WAS
ISSUED DECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT THE FUNERAL COULD TAKE PLACE
PEACEFULLY.  HOW SHOULD WE VIEW ALL OF THESE APPARENT CHANGES OF
POSITION BY THE FMLN?

   [SANCHO] AS FOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WE HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT
ADDITION TO BEING A POLITICAL FORCE, THE FMLN HAS HUMAN SENSITIVITY.
WE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO TAKE THIS HUMANE ACTION BY
DECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT MR. DUARTE COULD BE BURIED.  WE ALSO HAVE TO
MENTION THAT THE PDC AND ALL OF THE LEFTIST FORCES OF THE COUNTRY CAN
CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE DEPOLARIZATION OF SOCIETY.  THE TRUCE WAS A
GESTURE, IT WAS TO MAKE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SEE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE
TO DEPOLARIZE SOCIETY AND THAT EACH OF US CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION.

   THAT IS WHY WE INSIST THAT ONE MUST NOT RETURN TO ONE'S ELECTORAL
OR POLITICAL HEGEMONIC PLANS, BECAUSE THAT WOULD OBSTRUCT THE UNITY OF
THE PEOPLE, WHICH IS NEEDED TO ISOLATE THE FASCISTS.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER, THERE WAS A DISCUSSION AT THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY WHEN DUARTE DIED BECAUSE THE PDC LEGISLATORS MOTIONED TO NAME
HIM THE FATHER OF DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT
IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WHO WAS IN POWER FOR
ALMOST 10 YEARS, AND ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON?  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THESE TWO POLITICIANS?

   [SANCHO] WE BELIEVE THAT DUARTE WAS A FIGHTER FOR DEMOCRACY.  HE
HAD HIS OWN BELIEFS, HE HAD HIS OWN PERSONALITY, AND HE REALLY HAD
CHARISMA; WE CANNOT DENY THAT.  OF COURSE, WE CANNOT COMPARE HIM TO A
CRIMINAL WHO IS BEING SOUGHT BY JUSTICE.  I WOULD SAY THAT D'AUBUISSON
IS A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE, WHO HAS SOUGHT SHELTER FROM HIS IMMUNITY
AS A DEPUTY.  HIS IMMUNITY AS A DEPUTY DOES NOT PRECLUDE HIS CRIMES.
THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN DUARTE AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHO IS
WELL-KNOWN, BUT IS VIOLENT AND UNPOPULAR.

   [REPORTER] TO END THE FIRST PART OF THE INTERVIEW, ARE YOU
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A POSSIBLE CONCERTED EFFORT BY POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC
FORCES IN THE COUNTRY OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EACH WILL GO HIS OWN WAY.
ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A CONCERTED EFFORT?

   [SANCHO] A CONCERTED EFFORT IN A POLITICAL STRUGGLE OF ALL THE
FORCES IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD NOT ONLY BE SEEN AS A POSSIBILITY, BUT
MUST BE SEEN AS A POLITICAL NECESSITY FOR THE UNITY OF ALL POPULAR AND
NATIONAL SECTORS, BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY FORMULA TO REBUILD
THE COUNTRY, TO REUNITE THE COUNTRY, AND TO RECONCILE THE COUNTRY.
THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH A CONCERTED POLITICAL EFFORT.  I BELIEVE
THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS FOR CONCERTED
POLITICAL EFFORTS, WHICH WILL REALLY GIVE NEW HOPE TO THE LARGE
MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE MUST NOT FORGET ABOUT THE LARGE
MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE SPEAK ON
BEHALF OF CERTAIN GROUPS OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT ON BEHALF OF THE
MAJORITIES.

PART OF THE COUNTRY, MILITARY SPOKESPERSONS HAVE REPORTED.

   THE SOURCES INDICATED THAT THE REBEL ATTACK BY RIFLE FIRE BEGAN AT
0120 TODAY AND LASTED FOR FOUR HOURS.  AFTER THIS, THE ARMY WAS IN
CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.  THE NUMBER OF REBEL CASUALTIES IS NOT

DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS (DIJIN).

   ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINALS, WHO AGAIN DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS A
"POLITICAL-MILITARY" ORGANIZATION, "THE PROBLEM OF THE EXTRADITION HAS
BEEN RELEGATED TO A SECONDARY STATUS, SINCE OUR MAIN MOTIVE FOR THE
WAR WILL BE THE TORTURE, ASSASSINATION, AND DISAPPEARANCE OF OUR
COMRADES."

   A FEW DAYS AGO, IN A SIMILAR MESSAGE, THE CRIMINALS SAID THAT THEY
WOULD PLACE 5-TON DYNAMITE BOMBS IN "NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE BOGOTA
OLIGARCHY," IN REPRISAL FOR OFFENSIVE ACTIONS BY THE AUTHORITIES.

   YESTERDAY, A CAR-BOMB WITH 800 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS LEFT BY DRUG
TRAFFICKERS IN AN EXCLUSIVE SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL.  HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR A DEFECT IN THE DETONATOR, IT WOULD HAVE KILLED AT LEAST 5,000
[NUMBER AS RECEIVED] PEOPLE.

   ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINALS, THE RESURGENCE OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IS
DUE TO THE "DISAPPEARANCE" LATE LAST MONTH OF JOSE RETAVISTA GARZON,
FREDDY LOPEZ OSPINA, AND BROTHERS OMAR AND GUILLERMO PEREA RIVERA, WHO
REPORTEDLY WERE ARRESTED BY THE POLICE IN THE NORTHWESTERN TOWN OF
ENVIGADO.

   HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO AN INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT YESTERDAY BY THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, THESE PERSONS ARE NOT CONFINED IN ANY
GARRISON OF THE ELITE FORCE, A POLICE ANTITERRORIST CORPS.

   "THE EXTRADITABLES" NOTED THAT "THE GOOD FAITH OF THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL'S OFFICE IN NO WAY SATISFIES OUR DEMANDS, BECAUSE THE MISSING
COMPANIONS WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE SCHOOL (POLICE HEADQUARTERS) AND
EXECUTED BY ORDER OF DIJIN DIRECTOR OSCAR PELAEZ CARMONA, WHOM THEY
ACCUSE OF "MASTERMINDING" SEVERAL MASSACRES.

   THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA ALSO SAID THAT THE KILLINGS OF POLICEMEN
HAD BEEN SUSPENDED (14 UNIFORMED POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN
MEDELLIN SINCE LAST MONDAY) AND THAT THEY HAD NEVER PARTICIPATED IN
"TORTURE," BUT, THEY ADDED, "WE WILL INTENSIFY OUR STRUGGLE AGAINST
THE INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY, WHICH IS AN ACCOMPLICE TO THE
ASSASSINATIONS."

   THE WAR AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIAS IN COLOMBIA, WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE
EXPERIENCED A VIOLENT RESURGENCE, BEGAN LAST AUGUST AFTER MERCENARIES
AT THE SERVICE OF THE CRIMINAL GROUPS ASSASSINATED IN THE SPACE OF A
FEW HOURS A MAGISTRATE, A POLICE COLONEL, AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL
LUIS CARLOS GALAN.

   PARIS (FRANCE), 5 APRIL 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN LEADER
VIRGILIO BARCO BRIEFED FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS MITTERRAND HERE
WEDNESDAY ON THE EFFORTS MADE BY BOGOTA TO FIGHT THE COUNTRY'S
POWERFUL COCAINE TRAFFICKERS.

   MR. BARCO TOLD REPORTERS AFTER THE MEETING AT THE ELYSEE PALACE
THAT THE FRENCH LEADER, WHO VISITED BOGOTA IN OCTOBER 1989, HAD SAID
ONCE AGAIN THAT HE WAS "VERY INTERESTED" IN THE DRUG PROBLEM.

   FRENCH SOURCES SAID THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT HAD INFORMED MR.
MITTERRAND OF THE EFFORTS TAKEN BY HIS GOVERNMENT AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKERS AND DESCRIBED THEM AS ENCOURAGING.

   MR. BARCO WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT CONTROLLING IMPORTS OF CHEMICALS NEEDED BY TRAFFICKERS TO MAKE
COCAINE.  ASKED ABOUT BRINGING MEMBERS OF A POWERFUL GROUP OF DRUG
BARONS KNOWN AS THE "THE EXTRADITABLES" TO TRIAL, MR. BARCO SAID IT
WOULD "DEPEND ON EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE."

   THE TWO PRESIDENTS ALSO DISCUSSED THE COFFEE MARKET, FRENCH SOURCES
SAID.  COFFEE IS COLOMBIA'S MAIN LEGAL CASH CROP, AND PRICES HAVE
PLUNGED IN THE PAST YEAR WITH THE COLLAPSE OF A MARKET AGREEMENT
BETWEEN PRODUCER AND CONSUMER COUNTRIES.

   MR. BARCO VISITED STRASBOURG, EASTERN FRANCE, EARLIER WEDNESDAY
WHERE HE ADDRESSED THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY PARLIAMENT AND
APPEALED FOR EASIER ACCESS TO EUROPEAN MARKETS FOR COLOMBIAN GOODS.
IN AN ADDRESS TO THE BODY, MR. BARCO ASKED THE EEC TO REDUCE CUSTOMS
DUTIES ON COFFEE.  MR. BARCO, WHO HANDED OUT PACKETS OF COLOMBIAN
COFFEE TO EURO-MPS [MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT], ALSO ASKED THE COMMUNITY
TO LIFT TARIFFS ON FLOWERS, AND QUOTAS ON THE QUANTITY OF BANANAS
EXPORTED TO THE 12 EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY NATIONS.

   EARLY IN THE SPEECH, ECOLOGIST MPS HELD UP SIGNS LISTING VICTIMS OF
ALLEGED COLOMBIAN ARMY "ASSASSINATIONS."  THE PRESIDENT OF PARLIAMENT,
SPAIN'S ENRIQUE BARON CRESPO, SPOKE OF "CONCERN IN THE EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT OVER THE MANY INSTANCES OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE WHICH HAVE
CAUSED DEATHS IN COLOMBIA."  MR. BARCO ADMITTED "CERTAIN GROUPS HAVE
MANAGED TO CONTAMINATE SOME ELEMENTS OF THE STATE FORCES" BUT SAID
"THE GOVERNMENT HAD SEPARATED ITSELF FROM SUSPECT OFFICIALS," OR THAT
THEY WERE AT LEAST UNDER INVESTIGATION.

   MR. BARCO IS TO VISIT BELGIUM AND BRITAIN FOLLOWING HIS STAY HERE.

WATER IN THE CITY, AND EVERY ACTIVITY HAS BEEN SUSPENDED AS A RESULT
OF THE THREE-DAY "ARMED STRIKE" CALLED AS OF TODAY.  THERE IS NO
TRANSPORTATION EITHER, STORES ARE CLOSED, AND THE STREEETS ARE
PATROLLED BY THE ARMY AND THE MILITARY POLICE.  ROADS LINKING AYACUCHO
WITH THE DEPARTMENTAL PROVINCES OF CANGALLADO AND LA MAR WERE BLOCKED
BY SHINING PATH TERRORISTS WITH STONES AND TREE TRUNKS.  THE 55-KM
ROAD LINKING AYACUCHO WITH THE CITY OF HUANTA IS GUARDED BY 4,000
MEMBERS OF THE "PEASANT PATROLS," WHICH ARE OPPOSED TO THE "SHINING
PATH."  THERE ARE A FEW VANS ON THE ROAD, UNDER MILITARY SURVEILLANCE.
"SHINING PATH" TERRORISTS HAVE DESTROYED A SUSPENSION BRIDGE LINKING
AYACUCHO WITH THE PROVINCE OF JULCAMARCA, WHICH WAS THUS FORCED INTO
ISOLATION.

   CANDIDATES FOR DEPUTY FROM AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT FOR THE RULING APRA

   MEANWHILE, THE PEOPLE OF AYACUCHO ARE CHECKING THE VOTER LISTS TO
FIND OUT WHERE EACH VOTER WILL HAVE TO CAST HIS VOTE TOMORROW.

   THE SHINING PATH ALSO CALLED FOR AN "ARMED STRIKE" FROM TODAY UNTIL
MONDAY IN HUARAZ, CAPITAL OF THE ANCASH DEPARTMENT, BORDERING LIMA
DEPARTMENT TO THE NORTH.  THE CITY WAS PARALYZED AND IN THE DARK

CITY.  AS THE RESULT OF THAT ATTACK, FIVE PROVINCES OF ANCASH WERE
LEFT WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.

   THE SHINING PATH TERRORISTS HURLED EXPLOSIVES AT A MARKET IN
HUARAZ, INJURING 15 PEOPLE.  THE HUARAZ-LIMA ROAD WAS BLOCKED FOR 15
HOURS WHEN SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS SET TWO TRUCKS LOADED WITH MINERALS
ON FIRE.  ANCASH DEPARTMENT LIES OUTSIDE THE AREA UNDER THE STATE OF
EMERGENCY THAT ENCOMPASSES HALF OF PERU, INCLUDING THE METROPOLITAN
LIMA AREA.

   HUANCAYO, 415 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, IS COMPLETELY PARALYZED BY THE
"ARMED STRIKE" IMPOSED BY THE SHINING PATH. ALL ACTIVITIES-- BANKS,
COMMERCE, MARKETS, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION--HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. SINCE
FRIDAY THERE HAVE BEEN EIGHT BOMBINGS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
FACILITIES.  A CAR WAS DESTROYED BY A BOMB.  THE CITY'S ELECTRICITY
SUPPLY HAS BEEN CUT, FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF THREE HIGH-TENSION
PYLONS.  ALSO AFFECTED WAS THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY IN THE ENTIRE
MANTARO RIVER VALLEY, WHERE THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST HYDROELECTRIC PLANT
IS LOCATED. THIS PLANT SUPPLIES 80 PERCENT OF PERU'S ELECTRICITY.

   SINCE LAST YEAR, SHINING PATH TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN EXTENDING THEIR
ACTIVITIES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AYACUCHO TO THE STRATEGIC DEPARTMENT
OF JUNIN, BORDERING THE DEPARTMENT OF LIMA. JUNIN PROVIDES MOST OF
LIMA'S FOOD.

MONTANO, SALVADORAN DEPUTY SECURITY MINISTER, TODAY ADMITTED THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE SEIZURE OF AN ARMS SHIPMENT IN HONDURAS ON 7
APRIL MAY MEAN THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ARE PLANNING A NEW
MILITARY OFFENSIVE.

   ACCORDING TO MONTANO, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) MAY LAUNCH THE OFFENSIVE BEFORE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT- ELECT
VIOLETA CHAMORRO ASSUMES OFFICE ON 25 APRIL.

   "WE MUST NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SALVADORAN
TERRORISTS MIGHT PROMOTE TERRORIST ACTIONS BEFORE THE SANDINISTS
RELINQUISH POWER IN ORDER TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF ANTAGONISM AGAINST
THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN MANAGUA AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE
STRENGTH," THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID.

   ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE ARMS SHIPMENT SEIZED
BY HONDURAN AUTHORITIES ON SATURDAY CONSISTS OF 24 AK-47 RIFLES, 24
HANDLES AND 76 CLIPS FOR THOSE WEAPONS, 80 ROLLS OF "SLOW FUSE"
WEIGHING OVER 2 KG EACH, AND A "LARGE QUANTITY OF MATERIALS TO
MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES."

   THE MILITARY MATERIAL WAS BEING CARRIED IN A TRUCK BY SALVADORANS
VICTOR EMILIO DUBON AND FELICIANO GARCIA, WHO "WERE PART OF LOGISTICS
UNIT," OF THE FMLN, ACCORDING TO A PRESS COMMUNIQUE RELEASED BY THE
ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) TODAY.

   COPREFA ADDED THAT THIS FMLN "LOGISTICS UNIT" WAS IN CHARGE OF "THE
ARMS SMUGGLING TO EL SALVADOR."

   ON 8 APRIL, ANOTHER "LARGE QUANTIITY OF MEDICINE AND SURGICAL
SUPPLIES" WAS SEIZED IN THE HONDURAN DEPARTMENT OF COPAN, WHERE THE
ARMS CARGO HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THE DAY BEFORE, COPREFA REPORTED.

   "THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AGAIN CALL ON CITIZENS TO REPORT ALL
SORTS OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT MAY BE CARRIED OUT IN THEIR
COMMUNITIES AND THUS AVERT POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIONS BY THE FMLN,"
COPREFA SAID IN A COMMNIQUE RELEASED TONIGHT.

   THE CHARGES REGARDING THE SEIZURE OF WEAPONS AND MEDICINE HAVE BEEN
RAISED AT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ARE PREPARING TO
RESUME THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE UNDER UN SPONSORSHIP, PROBABLY EARLY
NEXT MONTH.

   THE DEPUTY SECURITY MINISTER NOTED THAT THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS
"ONGOING" BUT ADDED THAT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS "HINDER THE
NEGOTIATIONS."

   MONTANO MADE THE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS DURING THE FUNERAL OF OTTO
SORTO MILLA, SON-IN-LAW OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE CHIEF (GENERAL
RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA) WHO DIED YESTERDAY, 17 DAYS AFTER AN ATTACK IN

SPOKESMEN REVEALED TODAY THAT A REBEL CELL, IN WHICH TWO HONDURAN
WOMEN ARE MEMBERS, CLANDESTINELY INTRODUCED INTO THE COUNTRY, THROUGH
HONDURAS, SEVERAL PISTOLS, THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, SOVIET
RIFLES, MEDICINE, AND EXPLOSIVES FOR THE GUERRILLAS.

   IN THE FIRST REPORT, THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SAID DEFINITIVELY THAT
"THE WEAPONS CAME FROM NICARAGUA, THROUGH HONDURAS, DESTINED FOR
TERRORISTS IN EL SALVADOR."

   THE SECOND MILITARY REPORT ON THIS MATTER SAID THAT "THE NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS HAVE NOW MADE STEPPED-UP GUN-RUNNING
FROM THAT COUNTRY A SHORT TERM POSSIBILITY, NOT ONLY FOR OUR COUNTRY
BUT FOR OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REGION.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE, THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTRY SAID THAT THE ARMS
AND MEDICINE WERE INTRODUCED INTO EL SALVADOR IN 19 TRIPS OVER A
YEAR'S TIME FROM SAN PEDRO SULA (HONDURAS).

   THE MILITARY SOURCE SAID THAT THE REBEL CELL, CONSISTING OF
SALVADORANS TITO OLIVIO DUBON AND FELICIANO GARCIA SORTO AND HONDURAN
WOMEN ADILIA AND AMINTA DUBON RAMIREZ, "HAD THE MISSION" OF SECRETLY
TRANSPORTING ARMS AND MEDICINE INTO THE COUNTRY.

   ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY COMMUNIQUE, 155 AK-47 RIFLES, 45 PISTOLS,
60,000 ROUNDS FOR VARIOUS CALIBER RIFLES, 126 GRENADES FOR RPG-7'S,
MEDICINE, AND MATERIALS FOR MAKING EXPLOSIVES WERE CLANDESTINELY
BROUGHT INTO EL SALVADOR BETWEEN APRIL 1989 AND 7 APRIL 1990.

   TITO DUBON AND GARCIA SORTO WERE ARRESTED ON 7 APRIL IN COLOLACA
MUNICIPALITY, IN HONDURAS' LEMPIRA DEPARTMENT, WHILE TRYING TO
INTRODUCE THE ARMS SHIPMENT INTO THE COUNTRY INSIDE THE SECRET
COMPARTMENTS OF A TRUCK.

   ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY INFORMATION, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) CELL USED TWO DIFFERENT ROUTES FOR THE TRIPS,
DEPARTING FROM THE CITY OF SAN PEDRO SULA.

   "ON ROUTE 1, 12 TRIPS WERE MADE BETWEEN JUNE 1989 AND 7 APRIL 1990.
ROUTE 2 WAS USED FOR THREE TRIPS BETWEEN APRIL AND MAY 1989 TO A PLACE
LOCATED IN MERCEDES, OCOTEPEQUE DEPARTMENT, WHERE THE FMLN TERRORISTS
PICKED UP THE WEAPONS AND OTHER WAR MATERIEL," THE DEFENSE MINISTRY
REPORTED.

   THE REPORT DOES NOT SPECIFY THE ROUTE USED FOR THE REMAINING FOUR
TRIPS, IN WHICH THE SAME FOUR PEOPLE TOOK PART.

   THE TWO HONDURAN WOMEN, NOW UNDER DETENTION, GAVE THE SALVADORANS
FALSE DOCUMENTATION TO PASS AS HONDURANS, ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY
INVESTIGATIONS.  


DEV-MUC3-1225 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   HAVANA (CUBA), 5 APR 90 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [TEXT] VARIOUS
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS HAVE MADE POSSIBLE THE MEETING IN OSLO,
NORWAY'S CAPITAL.  AT THE END OF MARCH, A GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY
ARMY [URNG] DELEGATION, REPRESENTING ITS GENERAL COMMAND, MET WITH A
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION [CNR] DELEGATION, ACCREDITED TO SUPPORT
THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMY TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE VERY
GRAVE CRISIS THAT IS AFFECTING THE COUNTRY IN GENERAL.  IT IS WORTH NOTING
THAT THE POLITICAL WILL AND BROAD INITIATIVE REPEATEDLY DISPLAYED BY THE
URNG GENERAL COMMAND, WHICH SEEKS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE INTERNAL ARMED
CONFLICT WITH THEIR PARTICIPATION, HAS RECEIVED WIDESPREAD WELCOME AMONG THE
POPULATION AND HAS CAUSED GREAT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS
RESULTING IN THE APPROVAL AND SUPPORT OF A BROAD AND REPRESENTATIVE SEGMENT
OF GUATEMALAN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS.

   AS MAY BE RECALLED, IT HAS BEEN THE MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT WHO
HAVE OBSTINATELY REFUSED TO TALK TO THE GUATEMALAN ARMED INSURGENTS.
THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE WEAKNESSES, ISOLATION, AND CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN
THE ARMY AND THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  THE ARMY'S SECTOR
MOST RELUCTANT TO TALK WITH THE GUERRILLAS IS BENT ON RESOLVING
GUATEMALA'S ARMED CONFLICT BY WAY OF THE MILITARY, NOTWITHSTANDING
THAT IT CONTRADICTORILY REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR EXISTENCE.

   IT IS THIS SECTOR THAT THE TROOPS AND SOME OFFICERS -- NOT
PRECISELY THE SELF-NAMED MOUNTAIN OFFICERS -- BLAME FOR THE HARD
SETBACKS AND SEVERE BLOWS INFLICTED BY THE GUERRILLA FORCES, THE
FAILURE OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY, AND THE ARMY BEING BOGGED
DOWN.  FOR THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THE
SITUATION IS SOMETHING LIKE AN ALLEY, THE WAY OUT OF WHICH COULD BE
SEEN IF DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR GRAMAJO OPTED TO FOLLOW AND
RESPECT THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE OSLO AGREEMENTS.

   IN THE CASE OF GUATEMALA, HOWEVER, IT IS NOT JUST SIMPLY ENDING AN
UNDECLARED WAR THAT HAS LASTED NEARLY 30 YEARS.  IN THE OPINION OF THE
GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARIES, THE HELP OF ALL WHO FAVOR DEMOCRACY AND
PEACE IS NEEDED TO LAY DOWN THE BASIS FOR A GREAT NATIONAL ACCORD THAT
WILL ENSURE FOR GUATEMALA A SERIOUS PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND TALKS SO
AS TO RESOLVE THE HISTORIC AND ROOT STRUCTURAL CAUSES THAT HAVE
GENERATED THE DOMESTIC ARMED CONFLICT, WHICH STILL REMAINS INTACT.
THESE JUSTIFY AND GIVE VALIDITY TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROJECT, AND THE
PATRIOTIC AND POPULAR STRUGGLE BY THE ARMED GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT.

   COMPLIANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASIC AGREEMENT TO SEEK PEACE
THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS, SIGNED IN THE NORWEGIAN CAPITAL ON 30 APRIL,
DEPENDS THEN ON THE WILL AND POLITICAL ATTITUDE OF THE SIDES IN THE
CONFLICT.  THE GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARIES ARE PRECISELY THE ONES WHO
HAVE SHOWN THE MOST WILLINGNESS AND WILL, AND WHO HAVE MADE THE MOST
EFFORTS IN FAVOR OF PEACE IN GUATEMALA.  THEIR WIDESPREAD POLITICAL
AND DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES AND THEIR MEANINGFUL ADVANCES IN THE
BATTLEFIELD PERMIT THE INSURGENTS TO SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE
WITH ENOUGH RESOURCES AND CONDITIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE OSLO
AGREEMENTS ARE RESPECTED AND COMPLIED WITH; THAT GUATEMALA ENTERS INTO
A TRUE PROCESS OF DEMOCRACY IN ITS INSTITUTIONS AND STRUCTURES, WITH
BROAD NATIONAL SUPPORT AND INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY; AND THAT PEACE IS
REESTABLISHED -- AN HONORABLE PEACE WITH DIGNITY THAT GUARANTEES
SOCIAL JUSTICE AND INDEPENDENCE, PROGRESS, AND WELLBEING.

   SANTIAGO, 7 APR 90 (FORTIN MAPOCHO) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] THROUGH
HIS SPOKESMAN, U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL
VISIT CHILE IN SEPTEMBER.  THIS VERY IMPORTANT POLITICAL EVENT
DEMONSTRATES THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE COUNTRY
SINCE THE 14 DECEMBER 1989 ELECTIONS.

   THE ISOLATION HAS BEEN BROKEN AFTER A 16-YEAR PERIOD, AND IMPORTANT
WORLD PERSONALITIES ARE BEGINNING TO VISIT US.

   ITALY HAS CONSIDERED CHILE TO BE ONE OF ITS FIRST PRIORITIES FOR
ECONOMIC AID AND TRADE.  RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR COUNTRY AND BULGARIA
WERE RESUMED ON FRIDAY AFTER 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.  PREVIOUSLY,
OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES TOOK THE SAME PATH, AND IT WAS ONLY A FEW
DAYS AGO THAT THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT VISITED OUR CAPITAL TO CONFIRM
THAT LINKS HAD BEEN RESUMED BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS.

   IN GENERAL PINOCHET'S OPINION, CHILE WAS AT WAR FOR THE 16 YEARS OF
THE DICTATORSHIP.  CURIOUSLY, THE ALLEGED ALLIED CAMP, THE WESTERN
COUNTRIES THROUGH THEIR CHIEFS OF STATE, REFUSED TO TALK WITH HIM OR
EXTEND HIM INVITATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, IT WAS CONSIDERED DISGRACEFUL TO
HAVE ANY LINKS WITH THE REIGNING REGIME THAT HAD VIOLATED EVERY TYPE
OF HUMAN RIGHT ACCORDING TO 16 SENTENCES HANDED DOWN BY THE UNITED
NATIONS.

   FOR THE UNITED STATES, RELATIONS WITH CHILE WERE ANNOYING AND THAT
COUNTRY MADE IT KNOWN.  THE DICTATORSHIP'S COMMANDOS TRAVELLED TO
WASHINGTON TO KILL ORLANDO LETELIER.  FOR THIS OPERATION THEY VIOLATED
BORDERS AND LAWS WITH FALSE PASSPORTS TO CONDUCT THIS TERRORIST ACT
THAT IS STILL CONSIDERED A BLACK MARK AGAINST CHILEAN JUSTICE.

   NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF CHILEAN-U.S. RELATIONS HAVE THINGS BEEN SO
LOW AS DURING THE PAST 16 YEARS.

   ONLY IN LIGHT OF THIS BACKGROUND DATA CAN THE IMPORTANCE OF GEORGE
BUSH'S VISIT BE EVALUATED.  ALL THIS MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA
WITH THE RE-INSTATEMENT OF OUR NATION IN THE PLACE THAT IT HAS ALWAYS
HISTORICALLY OCCUPIED, THE RECOVERY OF OUR INFLUENCE, AND THE
IMPORTANCE OF THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE COMMITMENTS.

   BUSH'S VISIT IS THE MOST VISIBLE DEMONSTRATION THAT "THE WARS" HAVE
ENDED AND THAT INTERNATIONAL POLICIES ARE TODAY BUILT ON THE BASIS OF
UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.

ORGANIZATION HEADED BY FATHER JEAN BERTRAND ARISTIDE] IS GOING TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STREET URCHINS BEING HELD
23-30 APRIL IN BUENOS AIRES, CAPITAL OF ARGENTINA. THE REVEREND FATHER JEAN
BERTRAND ARISTIDE, WHO LEADS THIS LITTLE SOCIETY, WILL LEAVE HAITI ON 20
APRIL.  HE WILL BE HEADING THE HAITIAN DELEGATION TO THIS CONFERENCE.

   FATHER ARISTIDE SAID HE IS LEAVING WITH MUCH CHAGRIN IN HIS HEART
BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THE UNDERCOVER DETECTIVES STILL ARMED BUT THE
JUDICIARY HAS AS YET TO SHOW THAT CHANGE IS BLOWING OVER THE COUNTRY.

   FATHER ARISTIDE POINTED THE FINGER AT MRS. ERTHA PASCAL TROUILLOT,
WHO MUST SHOULDER HER RESPONSIBILITY BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD, WHICH
THINKS THE HAITIAN ARMY IS UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE NATION'S PRESIDENT,
LIKE THE HEAD OF THE ARMY DECLARED ON 13 MARCH 1990. FATHER ARISTIDE
FEELS ONE CANNOT COUNT ON THE HAITIAN ARMY TO PROVIDE SECURITY DURING
THE ELECTIONS. FATHER ARISTIDE SAYS THAT, EVEN THOUGH A PART OF THE
ARMY IS HONEST, THE TREND TODAY DICTATES ORGANIZED VIGILANCE BRIGADES
IN ADDITION TO THE HONEST PART OF THE ARMY, IF WE DO NOT WANT A REPEAT
OF 29 NOVEMBER 1987. FATHER ARISTIDE SAYS YES TO ELECTIONS BUT FIRST,
JUSTICE. IF NOT, THE OAS AND THE UNITED NATIONS CAN GO AHEAD AND COME
TO HAITI, BUT IT WILL BE LIKE WASHING ONE'S HANDS AND PATTING THEM ON
THE DUSTY GROUND TO DRY THEM.

   REGARDING THE WAY THE POPULATION IS PROVIDING ITS OWN JUSTICE BY
BURNING PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, FATHER ARISTIDE SAID THAT THE

THEIR DUTY; AND THAT IF THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE DOES NOT DECIDE TO
HURRY UP, THEY [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] MIGHT AS WELL SHUT IT DOWN AND
RE-OPEN IT WITH BRAND NEW PEOPLE.

   REGARDING THE RUMORS CIRCULATING TO THE EFFECT THAT FATHER ARISTIDE
IS PLANNING TO RUN IN THE FUTURE ELECTIONS IN HAITI, FATHER ARISTIDE
DECLARED: ARISTIDE HAS NEVER BEEN POWER-MAD. NOR HAS HE EVER HANKERED
TO BE PRESIDENT. FATHER ARISTIDE SAID, FURTHER, AND WE QUOTE: I HAVE
CHOSEN TO REMAIN AT THE SIDE OF THE MASSES. I WILL DO WHAT THE MASSES
ASK ME TO DO, AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE. [NO REFERENCE OF CLOSING OF
QUOTATION AS HEARD]

   LAST, FATHER ARISTIDE ASKED THE HONEST MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES
TO GO OVER AND STAND AT THE SIDE OF THE MASSES. BY SO DOING, THEY WILL
GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS PEOPLE WHO WORKED TO SET HAITI ON THE ROAD TO
DEMOCRACY.

   THUS, FATHER ARISTIDE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE THIS MORNING, TO
ANNOUNCE THAT HE WAS GOING ON A TRIP TO REPRESENT LA FANMI SE LA VI AT
THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STREET URCHINS THAT IS BEING HELD IN
ARGENTINA.

   BUENOS AIRES, 21 APR 90 (DYN) -- [TEXT] DEFENSE MINISTER HUMBERTO
ROMERO SAID TODAY THAT ARGENTINA HAS "SUSPENDED AND FROZEN" THE
"CONDOR" MISSILE PROJECT.  HE ALSO DENIED INTERNATIONAL PRESS REPORTS
THAT THE MISSILE WAS BEING BUILT IN SECRET WITH IRAQ FOR POTENTIAL USE
AGAINST ISRAEL.

   DURING A MEETING WITH REPORTERS THIS AFTERNOON, ROMERO SAID: "THE
PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF A POLITICAL DECISION, AND ALSO
BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE FUNDS TO FINANCE THIS TECHNICAL PROJECT."

   THIS IS HOW THE MINISTER IMPLICITLY ALLUDED TO THE REPEATED PRESS
REPORTS FROM EUROPE, THE UNITED STATES, AND THE MIDDLE EAST ABOUT
ARGENTINE PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ONE OF THE STAGES OF
THE IRAQI MISSILE SYSTEM.

   ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTION IRAQ, ISRAEL, OR THE
REPORT ON THE MISSILE, ROMERO SAID: "WE WANT TO PUT THIS TO REST IN
THE FACE OF PUBLICATIONS THAT APPEAR IN THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS EVERY
SO OFTEN."  HE ADDED: "WE ALWAYS SAID THE PROJECT NEVER REPRESENTED
ANY RISK OR DANGER FOR ANYONE, BUT AT ANY RATE THE PROJECT WAS
SUSPENDED, IT IS FROZEN."

   THIS WEEK IRAQI PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN SAID HIS COUNTRY CAN WAGE
A TOTAL WAR AGAINST ISRAEL THROUGH THE USE OF MEDIUM-RANGE STRATEGIC
MISSILES THAT CAN REPORTEDLY CARRY CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  HUSSEIN ALSO
SAID ANY ISRAELI EFFORT TO BOMB THE IRAQI MISSILE MANAUFACTURING
PLANTS WOULD BE FUTILE BECAUSE "OUR MISSILES ARE MADE IN PARTS IN
DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE WORLD."

   ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS THE
MANUFACTURER, IN COOPERATION WITH EGYPT AND IRAQ, OF MEDIUM-RANGE --
ABOUT 800 KM -- BALLISTIC MISSILES.  EACH TIME ARGENTINA HAS
CATEGORICALLY DENIED THIS.  THE ARGENTINE AIR FORCE SUCCESSFULLY
DEVELOPED THE "CONDOR I" AND "CONDOR II" PROJECTS.  IT HAS BEEN
ASSURED THAT THESE ARE FOR PUTTING A DOMESTIC SATELLITE IN ORBIT.

   THE LAST MISSILE TEST WAS MADE JULY L989 AT THE CHAMICAL AIRSPACE
BASE, LA RIOJA PROVINCE, WHERE A STAGE OF THE "CONDOR" MISSILE
TRAVELLED MORE THAT 160 KM.

FOLLOWING THE FOILED ATTACK ON SEVEN GENERALS, EIGHT COLONELS, AND OTHER TOP

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 90 (CANAL DOCE) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [COLONEL
SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ] [TEXT] 1. THE ATTITUDE OF CERTAIN BAD ARMED
FORCES MEMBERS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO CREATE A NEGATIVE IMAGE OF THE
ARMED FORCES IN GENERAL.  QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO
PURGE THE RANKS AND GET RID OF THOSE BAD MEMBERS, SO THAT THEY DO NOT
CONTINUE TO HARM THE REMAINING MEMBERS.

   2.  THIS PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR A PURGE IS SIMPLY THE
REPLY TO A HISTORICAL REQUIREMENT, BECAUSE WHOEVER REPORTS THE ISSUE
DOES NOT CAUSE THE DAMAGE.

   3. IN REFERENCE TO THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE
THE JESUITS, THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING THAT -- CARRYING OUT ORDERS.  I
HAVE ONLY SAID IN PUBLIC WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING AND
EXPRESSING IN A LOW VOICE.

   4.  THEREFORE, A NATIONAL COMMENTARY DOES NOT ENDANGER THE COUNTRY
OR THE ARMED FORCES.  THOSE WHO DECIDED TO ADOPT A DECISION, WHOSE
SUBSEQUENT CONSEQUENCES THEY SHOULD HAVE ASSESSED, ARE THE ONES WHO
ENDANGERED THE U.S. MILITARY AID AND -- IN THE PROCESS -- WITTINGLY OR
UNWITTINGLY PLAYED INTO THE FMLN'S [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] HANDS.

   5.  WE SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS INFORMATION ON THE ISSUE AND THAT IT
IS EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OF CERTAIN GROUPS WHICH, FOR ONE REASON OR
ANOTHER, HAVE FAILED TO TURN IT OVER TO THE APPROPRIATE PERSONS.

   6.  JUST AS THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND A VAST MAJORITY OF
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE EXPECTED, A FULL INVESTIGATION AND SOLUTION OF
THIS CRIME WHICH SHOOK THE WORLD, ALL GOOD SALVADORANS TRUST THAT
JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL AND THAT THOSE WHO VIOLATED THE LAW WILL ANSWER
FOR THE CRIME THEY HAVE PERPETRATED.

THE PEOPLE THAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ WAS
ADMITTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM THIS MORNING, AFTER HAVING BEEN SHOT
SEVERAL TIMES IN THE HEAD AND NECK A FEW MINUTES EARLIER.  THESE SHOTS
CAUSED VERY SERIOUS NEUROLOGICAL AND CEREBRAL WOUNDS AS WELL AS GRAVE
WOUNDS TO THE FACE AND NECK.

   DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF A TEAM OF DOCTORS, INCLUDING GENERAL
SURGEONS, NEUROSURGEONS, ANESTHESISTS, OPHTHALMOLOGISTS, DOCTORS FROM
THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, AND OTHER STAFF MEMBERS OF THE CNPS, IT WAS
NOT POSSIBLE TO SAVE HIS LIFE AND HE DIED [7-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] [END RECORDING]

   ...GOT INTO AN ALTERCATION WITH THE M-19 LEADERS WHO WERE THERE AT
THE TIME SHOUTING SLOGANS.  THEY DID NOT ALLOW THE CNPS SPOKESMAN TO
FINISH READING THE COMMUNIQUE.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE AGAIN CORDONED OFF THE AREA.  THE M-19 MEMBERS
ARE PROTESTING THE MURDER OF PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ [7-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE, THE F-2,
AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTAMENT OF SECURITY ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING
FOR AT LEAST TWO COLLABORATORS OF THE PAID ASSASSIN WHO MURDERED M-19
LEADER PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT AT LEAST TWO MEN COLLABORATED
WITH THE MURDERER INSIDE THE HK-1400 PLANE THAT WAS FLYING BETWEEN
BOGOTA AND BARRANQUILLA.  THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO REPORTED THAT THE
MACHINEGUN USED BY THE PAID ASSASSIN, WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS ALVARO

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A
TOTAL OFFENSIVE TO CAPTURE MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
FOLLOWING THE DEATH YESTERDAY OF NINE PEOPLE IN AN ATTACK BY THE
EXTRADITABLES IN MEDELLIN.

   THE OFFENSIVE WAS ANNOUNCED AT THE END OF AN URGENT MEETING OF THE
SECURITY COUNCIL CALLED BY GOVERNMENT MINISTER HORACIO SERPA URIBE,
WHO IS ACTING PRESIDENT BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S TRIP TO
NICARAGUA TO ATTEND THE INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT VIOLETA CHAMORRO.

   SERPA SAID THAT ESCOBAR HAS BECOME ENEMY NO. ONE AND NOTED THAT ALL
OF THE AUTHORITIES' EFFORTS ARE NOW CENTERED ON HIS CAPTURE. THE
MINISTER SAID THAT ESCOBAR IS BEHIND THE VIOLENCE ONSLAUGHT AND ASKED
THE POPULATION TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUTHORITIES' EFFORTS TO CAPTURE
HIM. "PABLO ESCOBAR IS BEHIND THE VIOLENCE ONSLAUGHT," THE GOVERNMENT
MINISTER SAID.

   NINE PEOPLE DIED AND APPROXIMATELY 50 WERE WOUNDED WHEN A CAR
LOADED WITH 200 KG OF DYNAMITE EXPLODED IN A HEAVILY POPULATED
DISTRICT IN MEDELLIN KNOWN AS LAS AMERICAS. POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT
THE CAR BOMB, WHICH WAS CAMOUFLAGED WITH CONSTRUCTION WASTE, WAS SET
OFF BY REMOTE CONTROL AT A PASSING ELITE POLICE PATROL.

   THE EXPLOSION SERIOUSLY DAMAGED OVER 10 PRIVATE VEHICLES AND AT
LEAST THREE BUSES WITH PASSENGERS AS WELL AS A DOZEN BUSINESS
ESTABLISHMENTS AND PRIVATE RESIDENCES.

   DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL OSCAR BOTERO RESTREPO SAID THAT THE ATTACK WAS
THE WORK OF THE EXTRADITABLES, THE ARMED WING OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, ONE OF
THE BIGGEST DRUG PROCESSING AND DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD.
MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA'S SECOND LARGEST CITY, IS THE HOME OF THE CARTEL AND OF
ITS ARMED WING--THE EXTRADITABLES--WHICH DESCRIBED THEMSELVES IN MARCH AS A
POLITICAL-MILITARY ORGANIZATION AND DECLARED WAR ON THE COLOMBIAN STATE.

   THE EXTRADITABLES ANNOUNCED AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE RELEGATING
THEIR STRUGGLE TO PREVENT THE EXTRADITION OF COLOMBIANS TO THE UNITED
STATES TO SECOND PLACE AND THAT THEIR TOP PRIORITY WOULD BE TO FIGHT
THE STATE, THE OLIGARCHY AND THE MEMBERS OF THE POLICE WHO KIDNAP,
TORTURE AND MURDER THE MEMBERS OF THEIR ORGANIZATION AND THEIR
FAMILIES.

   YESTERDAY'S ATTACK WAS THE SECOND TO BE CARRIED OUT AGAINST
COLOMBIA'S SPECIAL ANTIDRUG AND COUNTERINSURGENCY ELITE POLICE CORPS.
ON 11 MARCH ANOTHER CAR BOMB LOADED WITH OVER 100 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS
EXPLODED AGAINST A POLICE VEHICLE ON THE FREEWAY SOUTH OF MEDELLIN.
EIGHT POLICEMEN AND NINE CIVILIANS WERE KILLED IN THE EXPLOSION.

INSTITUTE, HAS DENOUNCED CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ' ASSASSINATION.  HE ADDED
THAT NO THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SUSPENDING THE ELECTIONS IN THE WAKE OF
THIS DEVELOPMENT, AND ADDED THAT THE COUNTRY MUST NOT BE LEFT IN VIOLENT
HANDS.

   THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER COMMENTED FURTHER ON THE TOP M-19 [19 APRIL
MOVEMENT] LEADER'S ASSASSINATION:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SERPA] THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH SAD AND CRIMINAL
DEVELOPMENTS IS TRULY A DISGRACE.  IT HAS SADDENED EVERYBODY VERY
MUCH.  I FEEL THAT THIS WAS NOT ONLY AN ATTACK AGAINST FORMER
CANDIDATE PIZARRO BUT AN ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY, DEMOCRACY, AND
THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  I FEEL THAT WE MUST RESPOND TO AGGRESSIVENESS
AND CRIME WITH FEELINGS OF CONCILIATION AND PEACE.

   [REPORTER] HAS ANY THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN TO SUSPENDING THE ELECTIONS
AFTER THIS ASSASSINATION, BEARING IN MIND THAT PIZARRO WAS ONE OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT CANDIDATES?

   [SEPRPA] HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CANDIDATES.
THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS THOUGHT SO.  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT HIGHLY
REGARDS THE PEACEMKING PROCESS IT HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT WITH THE M-19,
IN WHICH PIZARRO WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A KEY PLAYER.  WE HAVE ADOPTED SOME
DECISIONS IN THIS REGARD.  I AM GOING TO MEET WITH THE HEAD OF STATE
AND ALL OF US WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHING THE SAD DEVELOPMENTS WHICH
COLOMBIA IS EXPERIENCING WITH A DESIRE TO MEET THE NEED FOR
TRANQUILLITY AND COEXISTENCE WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE NOT HAD
THUS FAR.

   [REPORTER] MR. MINISTER, WHAT DOES THE FACT THAT TWO PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED IN LESS THAN 40 DAYS REPRESENT TO
THE GOVERNMENT?  HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT LOOK BEFORE THE NATION AND
THE WORLD?

   [SERPA] WELL, I REPEAT, THIS IS A VERY SAD CIRCUMSTANCE.  THIS IS
EXTREMELY WORRISOME, OF COURSE.  LIKE ALL COLOMBIANS, WE ARE TROUBLED
OVER THE FACT THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FLOODED WITH CRIME AND
BLOODSHED.  THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROTECT ALL
CITIZENS AND TO GUARANTEE THE ELECTIONS AND THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF
COLOMBIANS' LIVES.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE DELUDED MINDS AND THERE ARE
CRIMINALS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DAMAGING THE COUNTRY.  THIS IS AN
ATTACK AGAINST COLOMBIA, AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.

   [REPORTER] MR. MINISTER, HAVE YOU AT ANY TIME THOUGHT OF ADOPTING
SPECIAL MEASURES?  WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION IN
COLOMBIA AT THIS TIME?  WHAT REPORTS DO YOU HAVE?

   [SERPA] NO, THERE IS CALM IN GENERAL. THE GOVERNMENT IS VERY
WORRIED, OF COURSE.  WE ARE GOING TO MEET NOW TO DISCUSS THIS TERRIBLE
CASE.

   [REPORTER] HOWEVER, DO YOU NOT THINK THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
GO ON CAMPAIGNING IN PUBLIC AT THIS MOMENT?

   [SERPA] I WOULD NOT DARE MAKE ANY ASSERTION IN THIS REGARD. WHAT I
FEEL IS THAT WE MUST NOT YIELD A SINGLE CENTIMETER TO THE VIOLENT
PEOPLE AND THE CRIMINALS.  [END RECORDING]

   SERPA MADE THESE STATEMENTS A FEW MINUTES AGO AS HE LEFT THE
NATIONAL SOCIAL WELFARE INSTITUTE, WHERE AN AUTOPSY IS BEING PERFORMED
AT THIS MOMENT ON PIZARRO'S BODY.

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THIS IS THE
GOVERNMENT'S CLARIFICATION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE GOVERNMENT'S STAND.

   [MODERATOR] DAVID RIVAS OF AFP.

   [RIVAS] MR. PRESIDENT, YOUR REPLIES TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS HAVE
ALREADY ANSWERED MY FIRST QUESTION.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING, HOWEVER.  NOW THAT THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS ABOUT TO START,
THE TWO SIDES HAVE APPARENTLY HARDENED THEIR POSITIONS.  THE FMLN
COMMANDERS HAVE SAID THAT, TO END THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR, THERE MUST
BE A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF INJUSTICE AND LACK OF DEMOCRACY.  THE
MINISTER OF JUSTICE, IN TURN, SAID RECENTLY THAT THE FMLN MUST RETURN
TO CIVILIAN LIFE AND THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO NEGOTIATE.  I WOULD LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT WILL BE NEGOTIATED AND WHAT WILL BE DONE TO END THE WAR
THROUGH A DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN.

   [CRISTIANI] I AM SURPRISED BY THE REMARKS THAT YOU ARE ATTRIBUTING
TO DR. SANTAMARIA, BECAUSE HE IS VERY WELL INFORMED ABOUT WHAT HAS
HAPPENED SO FAR.  HE IS VERY MUCH AWARE THAT THERE IS POINT TWO OF THE
GENEVA AGREEMENT, WHICH NOTES THAT POLITICAL AGREEMENTS MUST BE
REACHED IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO ARMED CONFRONTATION AND THE VIOLENCE
THAT IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THERE WILL
BE A PROCESS FOR DISARMAMENT AND DEMOBILIZATION, REFERRED TO AS THE
TOTAL SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES IN THE AGREEMENT.  I BELIEVE THAT IT
IS A MATTER OF REACHING AGREEMENTS.  WE, AS A GOVERNMENT, ARE INVOLVED
IN THIS BECAUSE WE SEE THE SUFFERING OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE
BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT FAIR FOR THEM TO LIVE IN A CLIMATE OF VIOLENCE
IN WHICH THERE ARE SO MANY KILLED, SO MUCH DESTRUCTION, AND SO MANY
PROBLEMS.

   AS A GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE ALWAYS ASKED: WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS
BARRING THEIR RETURNING TO CIVILIAN LIFE?  THEY ARE THE ONLY GROUP
THAT HAS NOT JOINED THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  WHAT DO THEY
WANT?  LET US SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING REASONABLE THAT CAN BE DONE.
THE POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER ALL THAT
COULD FOSTER OR CONSOLIDATE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN OUR COUNTRY.  WE
BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEMS. I CANNOT SEE ANY HARDENING BY
THE GOVERNMENT.  I BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN FLEXIBLE.  WE HAVE SAID THAT
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTING AS ITS OWN ANY CONSENSUS
REACHED BY THE PARTIES.  IN OTHER WORDS, AT LEAST YOUR REMARK ON THE
GOVERNMENT IS NOT TRUE.  I REPEAT, PERHAPS IN THE STYLE OF THE
PREVIOUS QUESTION, THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO BE BIASED.  IN DUE TIME, WE
WILL SEE WHETHER THE FMLN HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN INFLEXIBLE OR HARDENED
OR WHATEVER.  IT WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER THE FMLN'S PROPOSALS ARE
REASONABLE OR NOT.

   [MODERATOR] PABLO YACU OF [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [YACU] MR. PRESIDENT, CONCERNING THE ECONOMY, SOME OF THE
OPPOSITION POLITICIANS I TALKED WITH OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE TOLD
ME THAT THEY ARE A LITTLE CONCERNED.  THEY THINK THAT, BECAUSE
DIFFICULTIES HAVE ARISEN, BECAUSE THERE IS A NEW SITUATION IN THE
COUNTRY, AND BECAUSE THE VOLUME OF THE U.S. AID HAS DIMINISHED, THE
COUNTRY IS RAPIDLY TAKING STEPS THAT OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES
HAVE ALREADY TAKEN, TO MEET WITH THE SO-CALLED CONSULTING GROUP FORMED
BY THE LEADING WORLD CREDIT INSTITUTIONS AND REQUEST LARGE LOANS TO
STABILIZE THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.  THESE POLITICIANS TOLD ME THAT
THEY ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS WOULD IMPOSE A HEAVY BURDEN ON THE NEW
GOVERNMENT, WHICH WOULD ASSUME OFFICE AFTER 1994.

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I THINK THE OPPOSITION POLITICIANS SHOULD TRY TO
UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF THE MEASURES, WHICH CERTAINLY ENTAIL A
SACRIFICE FOR THE VARIOUS NATIONAL SECTORS, ARE RESPONSIBLY TAKEN
BECAUSE OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  MANY PEOPLE
WILL SAY IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO THIS OR THAT.  I WOULD ONLY LOOK AT
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH, EVEN WITHOUT THE
DESTRUCTION AND VIOLENCE CAUSED BY AN IRREGULAR FORCE, SUCH AS THE
FMLN, HAVE EXPERIENCED MUCH MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAN THOSE
ENCOUNTERED BY EL SALVADOR AT PRESENT.  WE WOULD ALSO ENCOUNTER THOSE
PROBLEMS IF WE FAIL TO TAKE MEASURES.  NEARBY IS NICARAGUA, THE
INFLATION RATE OF WHICH HAS REACHED 1,700 PERCENT, ITS FOREIGN DEBT IS
ENORMOUS, AND IT IS IMMERSED IN DRAMATIC PROBLEMS.  NO MEASURES WERE
TAKEN IN DUE TIME IN BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA, ALTHOUGH THESE MEASURES
WERE PAINFUL.  IF THEY ARE NOT TAKEN ON TIME, THEY WILL BE MUCH MORE
PAINFUL LATER, BECAUSE EVENTUALLY SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE TO
CHECK THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN CREATED.  AT THIS TIME, WE ARE
TRYING TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY TO START ITS EFFECTIVE RECOVERY.  IT
IS BASED ON THIS RECOVERY THAT WE WILL AVOID FOREIGN INDEBTEDNESS,
WHICH FOR MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HAS BEEN AN EASY WAY OUT AND AN
ALTERNATIVE, WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE ACTED RESPONSIBLY CONCERNING
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] YES, I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TELL THIS TO THE
JUDGE AT THE 4TH PENAL COURT.  FRANKLY, AS I SAID, THIS CASE IS NOW IN
THE HANDS OF THE COURT.  THE JUDGE IS THE ONE WHO CAN ORDER FUTURE
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CASE.  YOUR QUESTIONS RELATE TO DOUBTS AND
CONCERNS THAT THE JUDGE HAS BEFORE HIM.  HE CAN SUMMON ANYONE TO
TESTIFY.  I UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS ALREADY SUMMONED SOME TOP OFFICERS.

   I CAN ONLY SAY THIS: YOU HAVE JUST MENTIONED A MEETING IN WHICH
SUPPOSEDLY I WAS PRESENT.  YOU ALSO SAID THAT IT WAS AT THAT MEETING
THAT THE MURDER WAS PLANNED.  THERE IS MUCH SPECULATION, THEREFORE I
THINK THAT WE MUST REMAIN COOL-HEADED.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE ARE
SPECULATING WHEN THEY SAY THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN, THIS COULD HAVE
HAPPENED, OR THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  FOR EXAMPLE, SOME HAVE
SAID THAT THERE IS A COVER UP, BUT COLONEL RIVAS HIMSELF WAS THE ONE
WHO DISCOVERED WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME.

   THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS, WHICH IS NATURAL.  HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT
MEAN THAT ...[CHANGES THOUGHT] FOR EXAMPLE, I MADE A STATEMENT FOR THE
PROGRAM "60 MINUTES;" I WAS INTERVIEWED FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF, BUT
OBVIOUSLY MY REPLIES WERE NOT AIRED FOR SOME REASON.  HOWEVER, I SAID
THAT IT IS NO SECRET IN OUR COUNTRY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PEOPLE,
A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE, WHO FEEL THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER SOME OF
THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE IN FACT LINKED TO THE FMLN.  THEREFORE, IN
THIS CASE, ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT WOULD HAVE
TO BE INVESTIGATED.  WOULD THAT BE CALLED FOR?  WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IT
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON SPECULATION.

   FURTHERMORE, DURING THE INVESTIGATIONS -- CONDUCTED BY THE
INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS, AN AUXILIARY LEGAL ORGAN
-- WE THOUGHT IT WAS CONVENIENT AT A GIVEN TIME, SINCE WE HAD ENOUGH
EVIDENCE ON A GROUP OF PEOPLE WE BELIEVE COMMITTED THE CRIME, THAT THE
CASE SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.

   THEREFORE, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TODAY CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE
CASE AND DECIDES WHETHER TO INTERROGATE SOMEONE OR NOT.  IF THERE IS
ANY DOUBT, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CAN ORDER THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE
THIS OR THAT.  WHETHER SOMEONE IS INTERROGATED BY A JUDGE OR BY THE
COMMISSION IS IRRELEVANT; THE JUDGE MUST DECIDE.  I BELIEVE THAT IN
THIS CASE THE JUDGE SHOULD INVESTIGATE.  AS I SAID BEFORE, I THINK
THAT THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THE HONOR COMMISSION
WILL BE SUMMONED, AND THAT ANOTHER MAY BE SUMMONED AFTERWARD.

   [REPORTER] COULD YOU TELL US IN ENGLISH.  YOU SAID THAT YOU DO NOT THINK
THAT IT IS NECESSARY, THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED THE JESUITS, AND IF
YOU ARE GOING TO START INVESTIGATING PEOPLE, WHY NOT INVESTIGATE EVERYONE
WHO HAS CRITICIZED THE JESUITS.  THE FACT REMAINS, HOWEVER, THAT NOT
EVERYBODY IS IN A POSITION TO REPROVE THE JESUITS, NOT EVERYONE WAS IN THE
MILITARY HIERARCHY, NOT EVERYONE WAS INVOLVED IN THE ALTO MANDO [PRECEDING
WORDS IN SPANISH].  THERE ARE [WORD INDISTINCT] PEOPLE IN THE ALTO MANDO WHO
ARE KNOWN TO HATE THE JESUITS, WHO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE CRITICIZED THEM IN THE
PAST.  WHY DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE CORRECT FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO BE
INVESTIGATED DIRECTLY?

   [CRISTIANI] FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD SAY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OFFICERS
IN THE ARMED FORCES AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER, WHETHER LATELY OR EARLIER, THAT
THERE WAS A WIDESPREAD BELIEF OF SOME SORT OF PARTICIPATION BY THE
...[CORRECTS HIMSELF] SOME OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WITH THE FMLN.  THIS IS NOT
FOR US AT THIS POINT AND TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER IT IS TRUE OR UNTRUE.  IT IS
SIMPLY SOMETHING THAT WAS BELIEVED OUT THERE, AND THEREFORE, IT IS UP TO THE
JUDGE TO DECIDE WHETHER HE WILL ONLY INTERVIEW ONE PERSON WHO BELIEVED THIS,
OR WHETHER HE IS GOING TO INTERVIEW MANY PEOPLE.

   THERE HAS BEEN ALSO THE FACT THAT IT WELL COULD HAVE BEEN THE ACT
OF THE FMLN, THE ACT OF INDIVIDUAL GROUPS.  THERE WERE ALSO
SPECULATIONS AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THE ASSASSINATION WAS COMMITTED AS
TO WHO COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME.  SO THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS THAT
COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME, AND THEREFORE, THERE COULD BE OTHERS
THAT WE COULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE [WORD INDISTINCT] INVESTIGATING.  BUT,
I THINK IT IS ALL UP TO THE JUDGE NOW [TO DECIDE] WHO WILL HE CALL TO
TESTIFY, WHO WILL HE CALL TO INTERROGATE, AND IF HE FINDS ANY NEED, HE
HAS ALL THE POWER TO INSTRUCT THE INVESTIGATIVE UNIT TO FOLLOW THROUGH
ON ANYTHING THAT HE REACHES.  IT IS NOT UP TO EXECUTIVE BRANCH RIGHT
NOW TO DECIDE WHO IS GOING TO COME UP WITH TESTIMONY WITH THE JUDGE.
IT IS UP TO THE JUDGE TO DECIDE.  [CONTINUED]

PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [MODERATOR] ROLANDO GONZALEZ, LOS ANGELES TIMES.

   [GONZALEZ] MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO MAKE A QUESTION THAT WAS MADE IN
SPANISH BEFORE AND IT'S RELATED ABOUT COLONEL OCHOA PEREZ.  HE HAS BEEN A
HARD-LINE MILITARY AND DON'T YOU THINK THAT HIS [WORDS INDISTINCT] GOT TO BE
POSSIBLE?  THIS IS ONE AND I GOT A SECOND ONE.  CAN YOU TELL US IN ENGLISH
WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE RELATION WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND WHAT
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT RECENT MACHINEGUN TRAFFIC OF THE GUERRILLAS?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, WITH THE FIRST CASE MY OPINION IS THAT ANYBODY THAT HAS
ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS
SHOULD -- INSTEAD OF SPECULATE WITH IT PUBLICLY -- SHOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE
COURT THAT IS IN CHARGE OF THE CASE AND GIVE ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE
TO HIM OR THAT HE IS KNOWLEDGEABLE OF, AND THEN HAVE THE JUDGE DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

   I THINK THAT MERE SPECULATION IN PUBLIC IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT
GOOD FOR THE JUDICIAL PROCESS BECAUSE IT CREATES PROBLEMS FOR IT.
SECONDLY, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A HIGH-RANKING OFFICER, IN CASES LIKE
THIS, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE OPINION OF A SPECIFIC MEMBER OF THE
ARMED FORCES IS ONE WHICH IS TOTALLY TRUE OR TOTALLY FALSE [SENTENCE
AS HEARD].  YOU CANNOT SIMPLY GO BY THAT AS A WAY TO SIMPLY STATE THAT
HIS STATEMENTS ARE TRUE.

   IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THAT WHEREAS BEFORE NO ONE REALLY
WOULD BELIEVE COL. OCHOA, ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYONE WANTS TO GIVE HIM
ALL THE CREDIBILITY IN THIS CASE.  I AM NOT SAYING THAT WHAT HE SAID
IS TRUE OR UNTRUE.  MY POINT IS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DEBATED
PUBLICLY; THAT ANYBODY -- COL. OCHOA, MEMBERS OF THE JESUIT COMMUNITY,
OR ANYBODY ELSE -- WHO HAS ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE TRIAL
SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE AND GIVE HIM THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT
WOULD BE HELPING THE PROCESS AND NOT MERE SPECULATIONS IN PUBLIC.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA, WE DISCUSSED THIS
WITH ONE OF THE ADVISERS OF MRS. CHAMORRO DURING OUR VISIT AND WE
DECIDED TO INITIATE [32-SECOND BREAK IN TRANSMISSION] PLANS AND,
THEREFORE, WE ARE WILLING TO REINITIATE THE PROCESS.  HER ADVISER WAS
VERY CLEAR TO STATE THAT THEY WILL BY NO MEANS AID THE FMLN IN THAT
RESPECT.

   WE THINK THAT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING BETWEEN THE 25TH OF FEBRUARY
AND THE 25TH OF APRIL IS THAT THE FMLN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TIME TO GET
ALL THAT WAS LEFT IN NICARAGUA....[CORRECTS HIMSELF) OUT OF NICARAGUA
BECAUSE THEY KNEW OF THE PROBLEMS THEY WOULD FACE WITH THE NEW
GOVERNMENT, AND THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER GO ABOUT FREELY IN NICARAGUA
WITH THEIR WEAPONS AND THEIR LOGISTIC SUPPORT.  THEREFORE, THEY HAVE
BEEN TRYING TO BRING THEM IN.  IN THAT CASE THERE WAS A GROUP OF FMLN
MEMBERS WHO WERE DETAINED IN HONDURAS WITH THE HELP OF THE HONDURAN
AUTHORITIES, AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAD BEEN SHIPPING WEAPONS BY
LAND THROUGH HONDURAN TERRITORY, BUT THAT GROUP WAS DETAINED.

   [MODERATOR, IN SPANISH] THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT; THANK YOU, MR.
FOREIGN MINISTER.  JOURNALISTS, THANK YOU.

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[GOVERNMENT MINISTER HORACIO SERPA URIBE] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING.  WE
COLOMBIANS HAD NOT GOTTEN OVER YESTERDAY'S CRUEL ATTACK IN MEDELLIN
WHEN WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH ANOTHER DISGRACE THAT TOOK THE LIFE OF
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO.  IN A MESSAGE FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, THE GOVERNMENT VOICED ITS DEEP ANGER AND
SADNESS OVER THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK AND IT RATIFIED ITS DETERMINATION TO
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITHOUT DISMAY AGAINST ALL FORMS OF CRIMES AND
THE CRIMINALS WHO ARE SO INFAMOUSLY ATTACKING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.

   THIS IS NO TIME TO ABANDON ANY ATTITUDE THAT IS DEEMED ADVISABLE
FOR THE NATION.  IN THE FACE OF THE FRATRICIDAL AND ANTI-PATRIOTIC
VIOLENCE, WE MUST ANSWER WITH ACTIONS OF UNDERSTANDING AND
CONCILIATION, WITH DECISIONS THAT WILL DISMANTLE THE BANDS OF
CRIMINALS WHO ARE DOING SUCH SERIOUS HARM TO THE PEOPLE AND WITH THE
DETERMINATION THAT WILL RENEW FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND IN
THE PURPOSE TO ACHIEVE THE BEST LEVELS OF COEXISTENCE.  THE GOVERNMENT
IS DETERMINED TO DO THAT.

   HOWEVER, THIS RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH ALL COLOMBIANS OF GOODWILL.
FROM EACH OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN, WE DEMAND POSITIVE ACTIONS AND A
GREAT SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
SAFEGUARDING THE CITIZENS' SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE NATION.  THE PEACE,
UNDERSTANDING, AND CONCILIATION TO WHICH CARLOS PIZARRO WAS COMMITTED
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE BASIC GOALS OF THE COUNTRY AND OF ITS
CITIZENS.

   ALL THE NECESSARY MEASURES THAT WILL LEAD TO CLARIFYING THAT
TREACHEROUS CRIME ARE BEING TAKEN TO DETERMINE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AND
THEN PUNISH THEM.  TO THIS EFFECT, THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION WILL BE
VERY SEVERE, AND THE INVESTIGATING AUTHORITIES ARE ALREADY BEING
PROVIDED VERY AMPLE COOPERATION.

   THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT [M-19] LEADERS, AND IT HAS BEEN ATTENTIVE TO ITS DEMANDS,
CHARGES, AND CONCERNS.  THERE IS A MARKED INTEREST BECAUSE THERE
CONTINUES TO BE DIRECT RELATIONS WITH ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, THE
VARIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND THE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SECURITY
AND INDISPENSABLE GUARANTEES SO THAT WE WILL HOLD THE ELECTIONS ON 27
MAY, AS THE PEOPLE WANT.

   NATIONAL COEXISTENCE, TOGETHER WITH THE CITIZENS' DEMANDS FOR
REFORMS, WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BASIC GOAL OF THE GOVERNMENT OF DR.
VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO WILL TOMORROW ADDRESS THE COLOMBIANS.  M-19 HAS
ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW IT TO MAKE PUBLIC ITS FEELINGS AND
OPINIONS IN THE FACE OF THIS GREAT TRAGEDY.

   THROUGH ME, AND ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF LAW 42 OF 1985, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS REQUESTED THIS AIR TIME SO THAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF,
SPOKESMAN OF THE POLITICAL PARTY WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS
BRUTALLY MURDERED TODAY, WILL BE ABLE TO FREELY EXPRESS HIS IDEAS.

   THOSE WHO SEEK TO EXCLUDE FROM THE ELECTORAL PROCESS A POLITICAL
PARTY -- REGARDLESS OF WHICH ONE IT MAY BE -- WILL NOT ACHIEVE IT,
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT ITS VOICE WILL CONTINUE TO
BE HEARD.  DESPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES, COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL WIN.


DEV-MUC3-1242 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 24 APR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION (UP)
TODAY ASKED COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TO BE ADMITTED TO THE
NEGOTIATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS HOLDING WITH DIVERSE POLITICAL
GROUPS TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF
NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.

   THE UP NATIONAL DIRECTORATE MET TODAY WITH BARCO AND GAVE HIM A
LETTER NOTING THAT THE EXCLUSION OF SOCIAL FORCES IN THE NEGOTIATIONS
MAY AGAIN BE A MOCKERY OF THE PEOPLE.  IT AGAIN ASKED FOR PROTECTION
FOR THE LIVES OF ITS MILITANTS.

   SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1985, MORE THAN 1,000 UP MEMBERS HAVE BEEN
KILLED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   THE UP EXPLAINS IN ITS LETTER THAT THE ASSASSINATION ON 22 MARCH OF
BERNARDO JARAMILLO, ITS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FORCED IT TO WITHDRAW
FROM THE 27 MAY ELECTIONS.  THIS DID NOT DETER IT, HOWEVER, FROM ITS
STRUGGLE FOR A PLEBISCITE AND FROM CALLING FOR A NATIONAL, POPULAR AND
DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.

   THE UP ADDED THAT A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, WHICH WILL REPRESENT ALL
POPULAR SECTORS, WILL BE CHARGED WITH DRAFTING CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.
THE REFORMS MUST THEN BE SUBMITTED TO A PLEBISCITE.

   A WEEK AGO, THE LIBERAL PARTY, SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY, 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT (M-19), AND NATIONAL SALVATION MOVEMENT MET TO TRY TO REACH
AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL PERMIT HOLDING A NATIONAL PLEBISCITE ON 27 MAY
TO APPROVE SUBSTANTIAL REFORMS TO THE STATE.

   GOVERNMENT MINISTER HORACIO SERPA URIBE STATED THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT AND DOES NOT SEEK TO IMPOSE ITS CRITERIA ON THE
WILL TO EFFECT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM.  HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
POSITION IS VERY CLEAR AND SEEKS TO RESPOND TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.

   ALSO, THE UP CONVENED POLITICAL PARTIES, SOCIAL FORCES, STUDENTS,
AND COLOMBIANS IN GENERAL WHO WERE EXCLUDED FROM THESE NEGOTIATIONS,
TO UNITE A PROPOSAL ON THE 27 MAY PLEBISCITE.

   FINALLY, THE UP DIRECTORATE ASKED, AS A CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE IN
THE COUNTRY, TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH THE REBEL FORCES.

   BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [STATEMENT]
[LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO] [TEXT]
COLOMBIANS, DURING THESE MONTHS OF NATIONAL TRAGEDY WE HAVE BEEN HIT
BY EVENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  VIOLENCE STRIKES THE HEARTS OF OUR
INSTITUTIONS, VALUES, DEMOCRACY, AND OUR BEST MEN.  THE ULTIMATE GOAL
OF THOSE ENGAGED IN VIOLENCE IS TO PREVENT DEMOCRACY FROM FUNCTIONING.
THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE UNLEASHED THEIR EVIL AGAINST OPTIONS FOR CHANGES
THAT COULD STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY AND PREVENT VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA.
BRAVE COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN MURDERED, ONE BY ONE.  THEIR EXISTENCE WAS
A THREAT TO THE SURVIVAL OF VIOLENT PRACTICES.  IT IS NOT A
COINCIDENCE THAT DURING THE CURRENT ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THREE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN MURDERED.  IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE
EITHER THAT OTHER BRAVE MINDS THAT ADVOCATED REFORM HAD BEEN KILLED
BEFORE IN THAT STRUGGLE.

   RODRIGO LARA, WHO WAS MURDERED SIX YEARS ON 23 APRIL, WAS THE FIRST
TO DENOUNCE THE GRAVE EFFECTS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ON THE STABILITY OF
OUR INSTITUTIONS.  THOSE WHO KILLED HIM WANTED TO OPEN PATHS FOR THE
SO-CALLED CRIME TOLERANCE.

   GUILLERMO CANO, A BRAVE NEWSMAN, REPRESENTED A FREE, CRITICAL
PRESS, SUCH AS IS NEEDED IN A TRUE DEMOCRACY.  HIS KILLERS THOUGHT
THAT BY DROWNING OUT HIS VOICE THEY WOULD INTIMIDATE THE DEFENDERS OF
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

   LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS KILLED EIGHT MONTHS AGO.  BY KILLING HIM,
THEY SOUGHT TO ASSASSINATE A HOPE OF RENOVATION AND CHANGE AND A DEEP
CONVICTION FOR THE NEED TO RADICALLY TRANSFORM POLITICAL HABITS AND
THE CLIMATE OF CORRUPTION, IMMORALITY, AND INDIFFERENCE IN THE FACE OF
CRIME.  THIS INDIFFERENCE LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF THE GREAT EVILS THAT
ARE CAUSING BLOODSHED IN THE COUNTRY.

   BERNARDO JARAMILLO STRUGGLED FOR A PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC LEFT THAT
REJECTED ARMED STRUGGLE AND THAT WANTED TO BUILD A MORE JUST SOCIETY.
BY KILLING HIM, THE CRIMINALS SOUGHT TO BLOCK THE PATHS TO LEGITIMATE
PROTEST WITHIN THE LAW.

   CARLOS PIZARRO, THE LAST LINK IN THIS MACABRE CHAIN THAT INCLUDES
SO MANY OTHERS, REPRESENTED THE POSSIBILITY FOR GUERRILLA GROUPS TO
LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN INSTITUTIONAL POLITICS, OR FOR WEAPONS
TO BE REPLACED BY LEGAL INSTRUMENTS TO STRUGGLE FOR LEGITIMATE IDEALS.
BY KILLING HIM IN A DASTARDLY AND COWARDLY MANNER YESTERDAY, THEY
SOUGHT TO DESTROY THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION AND REINCORPORATION OF
ARMED GROUPS INTO CIVIL LIFE.

   THE DEATH OF OUR COUNTRYMEN SHOULD NOT BE IN VAIN.  IT STRIKES DEEP
IN OUR HEARTS.  IT AFFECTS THE SPIRIT PROFOUNDLY.  IT MUST, THEREFORE,
AWAKEN THE NATIONAL CONSCIENCE, BECAUSE THOSE CRIMES ARE NOT MERELY
VILE CRIMES AGAINST UNARMED GREAT MEN WHO BELIEVED IN THE STRENGTH OF
IDEALS.  THESE HAVE BEEN CRIMES AGAINST OUR BASIC VALUES, AGAINST THE
CLEAN IDEALS OF PROGRESS AND PEACE THAT THESE MEN REPRESENTED.  WE
MUST NOT BE MISTAKEN.  THOSE WHO KILLED OUR LEADERS DID NOT EXTINGUISH
THE NOBLE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY GAVE THEIR LIVES.  THEIR VALUES WILL
PREVAIL.  THEY ARE OUR VALUES.  THEIR HOPES STILL LIVE.  THOSE HOPES
BELONG TO ALL COLOMBIANS.  THEIR DREAM WILL NEVER DISAPPEAR.  IT IS
THE DREAM WE ALL HAVE OF ATTAINING PEACE AND PROSPERITY.  THAT IS WHY
I PRAISE WHAT ANTONIO NAVARRO SAID LAST NIGHT: "I INVITE THE M-19 [19
APRIL MOVEMENT] TO CONTINUE WALKING ALONG THE PATH THAT PIZARRO
CHARTED.  TERRORISM'S GOAL HAS BEEN TO CLOSE THE PATHS TO CHANGE,
RENOVATION, AND REFORM.

   OUR PATH, ON THE CONTRARY, IS TO MAKE PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC
REVOLUTION VIABLE.  IT IS A REVOLUTION OF HOPE.  THIS DEEP CRISIS WILL
NOT BE SOLVED BY RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON THE
INSTRUMENTS OF DEMOCRACY, BUT BY UNITING EFFORTS OF ALL GOOD
COLOMBIANS TO REPAIR THE ROADS TO CHANGE, RENOVATION, AND REFORM.

   BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 [INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] I AM HAPPY
THAT NAVARRO, OVER THE TELEVISION, CALLED FOR COMMON SENSE AND FOR
PIZARRO'S FUNERAL TO BE CONDUCTED IN PEACE TOMORROW.  IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAW, THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE
SO THAT THE M-19 AND THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES CAN CARRY ON THEIR
CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES.  THE GOVERNMENT AND I HAVE FULLY SUPPORTED THE
ARMY, THE POLICE, THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY], AND
ALL OF THE AUTHORITIES CHARGED WITH MAINTAINING ORDER.  THESE AGENCIES
ARE AWARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND ARE MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO
CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES EFFICIENTLY.

   AT THIS TIME, THERE IS A TENDENCY TO OVERLOOK THE RESULTS ACHIEVED
IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE VIOLENT ONES AND THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS
ACHIEVED.  I UNDERSTAND THE IMPATIENCE AND THE DESIRE FOR DEFINITIVE
RESULTS AGAINST NOT ONLY DRUG TRAFFICKING BUT ALL OTHER EXPRESSIONS OF
VIOLENCE AS WELL.

   I WILL NOW MENTION SOME OF THE MEASURES THAT COMPLEMENT THOSE THAT
HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED THE CREATION OF
A HIGH-LEVEL COMMISSION, IN WHICH THE POLITICAL PARTIES ARE
REPRESENTED, TO FOLLOW UP THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND TO ASSESS THE
SECURITY MEASURES THAT THE PUBLIC FORCE AND THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE BEEN PROVIDING FOR ALL CANDIDATES.  THIS COMMISSION CAN BY ITSELF
PROPOSE NEW MEASURES TO REINFORCE THE ELECTORAL GUARANTEES IN VARIOUS
AREAS.  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND THOSE IN CHARGE OF
SECURITY WILL MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH OF THE POLITICAL
CAMPAIGNS TO CONSIDER THE EXISTING PROTECTION MEASURES.  THE
COMMISSION MET WITH THE M-19 AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY AND WILL
MEET WITH THE OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

   THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE
PROTECTION FOR ALL OF THE CANDIDATES.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO
WORK TO REDUCE THE RISK OF EACH OF THE CANDIDATES TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL.
FOR THIS REASON, THE GOVERMENT WILL REVISE THE EXISTING SITUATION
REGARDING MOBILIZATION AND LOCATION OF THE CANDIDATES.  ALSO, THE
GOVERNMENT WILL DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF ELITE POLICEMEN, WHO HAVE
DEMONSTRATED THE GREATEST EFFICIENCY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TERRORISM AND THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  THE 1ST ARMY DIVISION
COMMANDER HAS BEEN ASSIGNED THE SPECIFIC TASK OF COORDINATING ALL
FORCES, SECURITY AGENCIES, AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE MEDELLIN
AREA.

   THE COUNTRY KNOWS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS ENCOURAGED A BROAD,
PARTICIPATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROCESS.  TWO YEARS AGO, THE
GOVERNMENT PROPOSED A PLEBISCITE AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE CONGRESS A
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS BILL.  IN THIS WAY, THE GOVERNMENT
INTERPRETED THE NATIONAL FEELING, WHICH DEMANDS A MORE EFFICIENT
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND EVEN MORE STRINGENT ANTITERRORIST
MEASURES, FOR WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION.  THE
GOVERNMENT ALSO ECHOED THE PEOPLE'S CALL FOR STRONGER INSTITUTIONS AND
A MORE EFFICIENT AND REPRESENTATIVE CONGRESS.  COLOMBIANS KNOW THAT
THE CURRENT EVILS WILL BE DEFINITIVELY OVERCOME BY EXPANDING AND
STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY EVEN FURTHER, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR
THE CITIZENS' PARTICIPATION IN THE DECISIONS THAT CONCERN THEM MOST.

   I WANT TO REAFFIRM THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO DO
EVEYTHING NECESSARY SO THAT IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS WE CAN PAVE THE WAY
FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1245 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 [INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: THE
MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO SOUGHT BOTH TO DISRUPT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
ELECTORAL PROCESS, AS WELL AS TO DESTROY THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION
THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND M- 19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] HAD CAREFULLY BUILT,
SURPASSING NUMEROUS OBSTACLES.  IT ALSO SEEKS TO WEAKEN THE STATE AND
MAKE COLOMBIANS LOSE FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  HOWEVER, THOSE
WHO FOMENT VIOLENCE WILL NOT MANAGE TO WEAKEN A STRONG DEMOCRACY THAT
IS SUPPORTED BY ALL COLOMBIANS OR TO DESTROY THE PATH OF PEACE THAT WE
HAVE BUILT AFTER SO MANY DIFFICULTIES.

   TWO OF THESE DIFFICULTIES STEM BACK MORE THAN FIVE DECADES.  THE
FIRST DIFFICULTY WAS TO BUILD AN ATMOSPHERE OF PEACE IN A COUNTRY
WHERE THE VIOLENCE WE HAVE INHERITED FLARED UP IN THE FIFTIES, AND
AFTER HAVING EVOLVED, IT HAS TAKEN ON DIFFERENT FORMS, SUCH AS
NARCO-TERRORISM AND BANDS OF HIRED ASSASSINS ENCOURAGED BY GROUPS OF
THE EXTREME RIGHT.

   THE SECOND OBSTACLE, ALONG WITH THE PREVIOUS ONE, IS THE LACK OF
TOLERANCE FOR POLITICAL PLURALISM.  EVEN PROGRESSIVE IDEAS ARE MANY
TIMES CONSIDERED DANGEROUS BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT REALIZE THAT THE COLD
WAR IS OVER.  A PLURALIST DEMOCRACY IS NOT AFRAID OF COMMUNISM.  ON
THE CONTRARY, IT ACCEPTS COMMUNISM, BUT IT DOES NOT ACCEPT VIOLENCE,
REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE.  THE USE OF WEAPONS BOTH TO DEFEND AN
IDEOLOGY, AS WELL AS TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, IS UNACCEPTABLE IN A
PLURALIST DEMOCRACY.

   THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAGIC MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO
WILL NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY WHAT HAS BEEN BEEN ACHIEVED, THAT IS, A
CLEAR, VIABLE, AND DEFINED PATH TO PEACE.  THE OBLIGATION WE HAVE
AHEAD OF US AND THAT WE WILL CARRY OUT UNITED IS TO KEEP THAT PATH OF
PEACE OPEN.

   ALL COLOMBIANS ADMIRE THE PEACE INITIATIVES OF THE M-19, AND WE
SHARE THE GRIEF OF THE RELATIVES AND FOLLOWERS OF CARLOS PIZARRO,
BECAUSE THEIR SADNESS AND ANGER IS SHARED BY ALL COLOMBIANS WHO LOVE
PEACE.  FACTS SHOW THAT THE M-19 MEMBERS WISELY ADOPTED THE DECISION
TO REJOIN DEMOCRACY AND REMAIN IN DEMOCRACY, TO STRUGGLE FOR PEACE,
AND TO PROMOTE LEGALLY THE REFORMS THEY CONSIDER NECESSARY.

   WHEN THEY ABANDONED THEIR WEAPONS, THEY DID NOT ABANDON THE
STRUGGLE FOR THEIR IDEALS.  THEY HAVE ALL THEIR RIGHTS, BECAUSE THEY
ARE NO LONGER A GUERRILLA GROUP.  M-19 IS NOW A POLITICAL PARTY, WITH
ALL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF A POLITICAL PARTY AND WHOSE IDEAS SHOULD BE
TOLERATED.  THOSE WHO, THROUGH VIOLENCE, ARE TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE
M-19 FLAG AND TO PREVENT ITS CANDIDATES FROM RUNNING IN THE ELECTIONS
AND TO STOP THEM FROM CONDUCTING POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING, ARE NOT JUST
THE ENEMIES OF THAT MOVEMENT, THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF PEACE.  THEY ARE
TRYING TO DESTROY THE PATH THAT WAS BUILT FOR THE REINCORPORATION OF
THE GUERRILLA GROUPS INTO CIVILIAN LIFE.

   THE MATERIAL AND INTELLECTUAL AUTHORS OF CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER
ARE THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE THEY HOPE TO SABOTAGE THE
ELECTIONS AND PREVENT NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLITICAL PARTICIPATION.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ALLOW THE VOICE OF M-19 TO BE SILENCED.
THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY REQUESTED AIRTIME ON TELEVISION SO
THAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, LEADER OF THAT PARTY, COULD EXPRESS HIS
OPINIONS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.  [CONTINUED]

[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] WHEN THE
CONVERGENCE OF OPINIONS ON THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE CREATION OF
A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS MADE PUBLIC, THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRIBUTE
TOWARD THE COUNTING OF THE RELEVANT BALLOT PAPERS.

   THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE THE RISK FOR EACH OF THE CANDIDATES.  DESPITE THE STRICT
SECURITY MEASURES TAKEN BY CARLOS PIZARRO, THE SUICIDAL CALLING OF A
HIRED ASSASSIN AT THE SERVICE OF EVIL INTERESTS ENDED HIS LIFE.

   IN VIEW OF THESE TOTALLY IRRATIONAL METHODS, LARGE NUMBERS OF
BODYGUARDS, BULLETPROOF VESTS, AND PRACTICAL SECURITY MEASURES COULD
HELP, BUT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH.

   IT IS NECESSARY FOR AUTHORITIES AND CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS TO TAKE
MAXIMUM PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES.  THERE MUST BE MORE MODERN AND DIRECT
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PEOPLE.

   I ADMIRE THE COURAGE OF THE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE GONE TO PUBLIC
SQUARES, BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THE HEALTH OF DEMOCRACY AND THE
STABILITY OF INSTITUTIONS DEPENDS ON THE LIVES OF THE CANDIDATES.

   SO THIS CAMPAIGN CAN TAKE PLACE UNDER THE BEST OF CONDITIONS
WITHOUT THE NEED FOR CANDIDATES TO RUN THE RISKS INVOLVED IN
TRADITIONAL FORMS OF PROSELYTISM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO
INCREASE TELEVISION TIME FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OF THE
PARTIES AND MOVEMENTS THAT ARE REPRESENTED IN CONGRESS, ON BOTH
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL CHANNELS.

   IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALLOW THE FREE USE OF RADIO
STATIONS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AND WILL GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
ADVERTISEMENTS.  WE ARE TRYING FOR A MORE MODERN CAMPAIGN IN WHICH NEW
TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO EXPLAIN THE PROGRAMS OF THE CANDIDATES SO
THAT THEY CAN DIRECTLY MAKE CONTACT WITH CITIZENS AND THEIR FAMILIES
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

   BESIDES, THE GOVERNMENT WILL INTENSIFY ITS CIVIC CAMPAIGN BY
INVITING ALL CITIZENS TO VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS.  THEIR VOTE FOR
ANY OF THE CANDIDATES OR EVEN A BLANK VOTE IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE
PEOPLE'S REJECTION OF VIOLENCE.  IT IS A WAY OF RESOLVING CONFLICTS BY
PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC MEANS.

   TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS IS TO VOTE FOR PEACE,
FOR DEMOCRACY AND TOLERANCE.  AMID THE SITUATION IN WHICH THIS COUNTRY
IS LIVING, VOTING IS AN OBLIGATION.  NO CITIZEN WITH A RIGHT TO VOTE
CAN AFFORD TO REMAIN AT HOME AND REMAIN INDIFFERENT.  [CONTINUED]

CALLEJAS BY MODERATOR VALLADARES AND REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[CALLEJAS] WHAT I HAVE TO SAY THIS EVENING IS THAT WE MADE A CORRECT
DECISION.  THE ARMED FORCES' BUDGET WAS REDUCED BY 10 PERCENT; TO ASK
FOR A GREATER REDUCTION IS NOT TO KNOW OUR COUNTRY'S REALITY AND TO
DESTROY THE ARMED FORCES.  TO REDUCE THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' BUDGET
BY 50 PERCENT IS TANTAMOUNT TO DISMANTLING IT, AND I FOR ONE AM NOT
WILLING TO MAKE THAT DECISION.  I AGREED TO TAKE THE CORRECT PATH AT
THE RIGHT MOMENT; TO REDIRECT THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND TO SEE
THEY ALSO ACT WITH AUSTERITY AND IN THE BEST NATIONAL INTEREST.

   IT IS EASY TO CRITICIZE AND SAY THINGS, BUT WHEN THESE PEOPLE HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THIS, NOTHING WAS DONE.  I HAVE ACTED.

   [VALLADARES] GERMAN REYES OF ACAN-EFE.

   [REYES] GOOD EVENING.  BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE I THINK WE SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO THE HOUSEWIVES FOR HAVING RUINED THEIR SOAP OPERA.
REGARDING THE GREEN BATTALIONS YOU MENTIONED, MR. PRESIDENT, WHICH ARE
GOING TO BE INSTALLED IN YAMALES -- WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BEFORE
THE CONTRAS ENTERED -- HOW ARE THE ONUCA [UNITED NATIONS OBSERVER
GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA] OFFICERS GOING TO VERIFY THAT THE CONTRA
WITHDRAWAL FROM HONDURAN TERRITORY?

   [CALLEJAS] THERE IS NO PROBLEM.  THE YAMALES CAMP IS INSIDE
HONDURAN TERRITORY.  THERE ARE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW ONUCA AND CIAV
[INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION] FORCES TO
CONTROL THESE PERSONS.  ONCE MORE I WOULD LIKE TO REFER TO THE
POSITION YOU ARE TAKING: WHY NOT SEE THINGS POSITIVELY?  INSTEAD OF
SAYING WE HAD CONTRAS HERE FOR 10 YEARS, SAY THAT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE
ANY.  I THINK THIS IS THE TYPE OF OPTIMISM WE SHOULD IMPRESS UPON THE
COUNTRY.  LET US NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT YESTERDAY, INSTEAD BUILD ON
TODAY'S REALITY.  I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE AT THIS NEWS CONFERENCE
AND TO BE ABLE TO TELL MY FELLOW CITIZENS AND YOU THAT NO LONGER ARE
WE TO HAVE CONTRAS IN HONDURAS -- A POSITIVE STEP.  IN THIS REGARD THE
GREEN BATTALIONS AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE TAKING ACTION TO ADMINISTER
A TERRITORY THAT ONLY YESTERDAY WAS RELATIVELY OUT OF CONTROL OF THE
GOVERNMENT.

   [VALLADARES] [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THESE $247
MILLION -- IT SEEMS LIKE A LARGE SUM -- WHICH TELLS OF THE SUCCESS OF
YOUR TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES.  THIS, HOWEVER, IS TO BE USED TO PAY
DEBTS.  DO YOU KNOW OF ANY SPECIFIC AMOUNTS YOU MAY BE RECEIVING IN
THE FUTURE, OR IS IT A QUESTION OF HAVING TO WAIT THERE WITH A LITTLE
PAPER BAG TO THEN HAND IT OVER TO [CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT] DON RICARDO
MADURO?  WHAT ARE THE RESOURCE FORECASTS AND WHAT DEFINITE INVESTMENT
PLANS ARE THERE FOR THESE RESOURCES?  ONE MUST ESPECIALLY TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON THE CENTRAL BANK CURRENCY
RESERVES SINCE INFLATION CAN BE A TIME BOMB.  LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO
ASK YOU IF YOU.... [CHANGES THOUGHT] APPARENTLY MY COLLEAGUE REGINA
HAS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION BEFORE YOU END THE CONFERENCE WITH ME. THANK
YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

   [CALLEJAS] NO PROBLEM.  I WOULD CONTINUE THIS CONFERENCE ALL NIGHT
LONG, ALTHOUGH I DO NOT WISH TO KEEP THE HOUSEWIVES FROM THEIR
PROGRAMS.  HOWEVER, EVERYTHING HAS A TIME FRAME AND OUR INTEREST IS
THAT ALL REPORTERS HERE TONIGHT SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING
PART IN THIS NEWS CONFERENCE.  GETTING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, THE
TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE ARMED FORCES WAS ESTABLISHED
THIS WAY: THE 1989 BUDGET APPROVED BY CONGRESS WAS 150 MILLION
LEMPIRAS.

   [REPORTER] PERHAPS I DID NOT MAKE MYSELF CLEAR.  I WAS REFERRING TO
THE FUNDS THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE AVAILABLE ONCE LOANS WERE PAID OFF
WITH THESE STOPGAP LOANS.

   [CALLEJAS] YOU ARE RIGHT.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE STOPGAP
FINANCING FOR $247 MILLION.  THIS STOPGAP LOAN OPENS THE PATH SO THAT
FRIENDLY COUNTRIES AND BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL FINANCIAL
ORGANIZATIONS CAN RESUME THEIR LOANS TO THE COUNTRY.  THESE FUNDS WILL
GIVE US THE RIGHT TO DRAW ON SPECIAL IMF ACCOUNTS, FUNDS FROM SPECIAL
WORLD BANK PROGRAMS SUCH AS SAL-1 AND SAL-2, OR FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN
WITHHELD FROM JAPAN AND GERMANY.  THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THESE FUNDS IS
ENOUGH TO PAY THE $247 MILLION STOPGAP LOAN IN FULL AND STILL HAVE
SOME CASH LEFT OVER FOR SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY GENERATE
FUNDS FOR THE COUNTRY.  THE PRECISE AMOUNTS WILL BE GIVEN BY THE
CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT; HOWEVER, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THE AMOUNT
OF FUNDS TO BE RECEIVED WILL BE NO LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING LOANED,
PLUS SOME SURPLUSES FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND FRIENDLY
COUNTRIES, WHICH HAVE WITHHELD THEIR LOANS OR DONATIONS BECAUSE OF
HONDURAS' INELIGIBILITY WITH THE IMF.  [CONTINUED]

   NAVARRO WOLFF, WHO IS A FORMER GUERRILLA LIKE THE SLAIN LEADER,
RECEIVED THE NOMINATION WHEN PIZARRO'S FUNERAL PROCESSION STOPPED AT
THE HOME OF LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR IN BOGOTA.

   IN A SPEECH MADE TO THE THOUSANDS AT THE FUNERAL, NAVARRO ACCEPTED
THE NOMINATION AND SAID THAT HE WAS PICKING UP THE BANNERS OF THE
SLAIN LEFTIST LEADER.


DEV-MUC3-1249 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 29 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
OF M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] PRESIDENT CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ, THE GROUP'S
NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF SAID THAT HIS GROUP WILL
CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE.  THE M-19, THE ORGANIZATION THAT SIGNED A
PEACE AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT ON 8 MARCH AND
LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY, SAID THAT IT
WILL NOT PICK UP ITS WEAPONS AGAIN AS A RESULT OF THE MURDER OF THE
39-YEAR-OLD PIZARRO.  PIZARRO WAS BURIED YESTERDAY.  ONLY 50 DAYS AFTER
REJOINING CIVILIAN LIFE FOLLOWING MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF ARMED STRUGGLE,
PIZARRO BECAME A SYMBOL FOR PEACE, ALTHOUGH, ACCORDING TO COMMENTATORS, WITH
HIS DEATH HIS KILLERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY.

   WHEN ACCEPTING THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION, ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF,
A 42-YEAR-OLD ENGINEER, FORMER DEAN OF A UNIVERSITY, REBEL, AND THE
OLDEST OF SEVEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS, SAID THAT HE WAS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT FOR THAT COLOMBIA WHICH WANTS DEMOCRACY AND WISHES TO LIVE
IN PEACE.  THE NEW M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS FORCED TO SPEAK AND
ACCEPT THE NOMINATION WHEN PIZARRO'S FUNERAL PROCESSION MADE A STOP AT
THE HOME OF THE LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR.  HE SAID THAT THE COLOMBIAN
PEOPLE MUST UNITE TO MAKE HARMONY POSSIBLE, AND HE URGED EVERYONE TO
CONTRIBUTE TO A FUTURE OF PEACE, A BETTER FUTURE FOR COMING
GENERATIONS.  SPEAKING BEFORE PIZARRO'S CASKET, WHICH WAS DRAPED WITH
THE COLOMBIAN FLAG, NAVARRO, WHO IN 1985 SURVIVED AN ATTACK DURING
WHICH HE LOST A LEG, SWORE TO FIGHT FOR PEACE AS PIZARRO HAD DONE.

   THE THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO ATTENDED SATURDAY'S FUNERAL CARRIED
PLACARDS WITH SLOGANS THAT READ: COMMANDER PIZARRO, WE CONTINUE
FORWARD, AND COMRADE PIZARRO, WE ARE FOR PEACE, WE SWEAR.  OTHERS WHO
JOINED THE THOUSANDS OF VOICES ASKING NAVARRO TO ACCEPT THE
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION BROKE THE SILENCE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO
CHANT: PIZARRO PRESENT, NAVARRO PRESIDENT.

   PIZARRO'S MOTHER MARGOT DE PIZARRO, ALONG WITH HIS LADY FRIEND
LAURA, SPOKE AT THE GRAVE SITE AND ASKED THE CROWD TO FIGHT FOR PEACE
AS HE HAD ALWAYS DONE.

   AT THE CEMETERY THE NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AGAIN ADDRESSED THE
CROWD, WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE MORE THAN SEVEN-HOUR-LONG FUNERAL
PROCESSION FROM THE CATHEDRAL TO SIMON BOLIVAR'S HOME AND THEN TO THE
CEMETERY.  HE SAID: TOGETHER WITH ALL THE GOOD COLOMBIANS, WE ARE
GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY.  HE ADDED THAT PIZARRO'S MURDER
WAS USELESS BECAUSE THE M-19 WILL CONTINUE ITS STRUGGLE FOR PEACE.

   PIZARRO'S FUNERAL WAS HELD IN BOGOTA.  THE AUTHORITIES PRAISED THE
FACT THAT NO INCIDENTS OR PUBLIC DISORDERS DEVELOPED DURING THE

   BUENOS AIRES, 29 APR 90 (CLARIN) -- [ARTICLE] [DANIEL E. ARIAS]
[TEXT] EVERYBODY IS PRAISING AND JUSTIFYING THE ARGENTINE CONDOR II
PROJECT -- THE ONLY ONE WE HAD -- NOW THAT IT HAS OFFICIALLY DIED,
HOWEVER, A MORE TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE DEFUNCT PROJECT WILL
REVEAL THE GAP LEFT BY OUR FLIMSY SPACE PROJECT.

   ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF FUEL USED, MISSILES ARE CLASSIFIED AS
SOLID, LIQUID, AND CRYOGENIC-FUELED MISSILES.  THE SOLID-FUELED
MISSILES CARRY THEIR FUEL (THAT BURNS) AND THE COMBURENT (THAT
SUPPLIES THE OXYGEN TO TRIGGER THE COMBUSTION) ON A STICKY ROD, THE
COMBUSTION OF WHICH CANNOT BE REGULATED.  THE CAKE BURNS COMPLETELY
ONCE THE COMBUSTION STARTS.  THEREFORE, SOLID-FUELED MISSILES ARE
DIFFICULT TO CONTROL ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MUCH SIMPLER AND CHEAPER.
MOREOVER, THEY PUT UP WITH ROUGH HANDLING AND CAN BE EASILY FIRED.
THE MILITARY PREFER THIS TYPE FOR MANUFACTURING SHORT-RANGE MISSILES.

   THE LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES CARRY THE FUEL AND THE COMBURENT IN
COMPLETELY SEPARATE TANKS.  THE TWO ELEMENTS MEET IN A COMBUSTION
CHAMBER WHERE THEY IGNITE AFTER TRAVELLING THROUGH PIPES.  VALVES MAKE
IT POSSIBLE TO REGULATE THE POWER OF THE ENGINE.  GROUND PERSONNEL ARE
ABLE TO STOP THE ENGINE AND RESTART IT IN FULL FLIGHT, IN SHORT, TO
CONTROL THE MISSILE AS THEY WISH THROUGH RADIO MESSAGES.

   THE CRYOGENIC-FUELED MISSILES WERE DEVELOPED DURING THE 70'S AND
80'S.  THEY CARRY HYDROGEN AND LIQUID GAS WHICH ARE LIGHTER THAN ANY
OTHER PROPELLANT ELEMENT BUT WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO REFRIGERATE
AND TO ISOLATE.  THIS TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD VERY FAST
VEHICLES BECAUSE OF THEIR POWER TO WEIGHT RATIO.

   THEY ARE USED TO PLACE HUGE COMMUNICATION SATELLITES IN SPACE SOME
36,000 KM ABOVE THE EQUATOR, OR TO ATTACK A CITY FROM THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE WORLD.

   LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES REPRESENT THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED DURING
THE 50'S AND 60'S AND, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, EXPLAINS SOVIET LEADERSHIP
IN SPACE RESEARCH.  THESE OLD, HEAVY, CUMBERSOME, AND UNBREAKABLE
MISSILES DO NOT HAVE FRAGILE EQUIPMENT AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PLACE
CARGO INTO OUTER SPACE AT A REASONABLE COST.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE
LARGE FAMILY OF U.S. AND EUROPEAN CRYOGENIC- FUELED MISSILES CONTINUE
AT AN EXPERIMENTAL STAGE AND ARE UNPREDICTABLE (AS THE CASE OF THE
SPACE SHUTTLE AND THE ARIANE IV AND V).  MOREOVER, THEY ARE INCREDIBLY
COSTLY.

   TOO POOR TO EVEN THINK OF DEVELOPING LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES, BRAZIL
AND ARGENTINA HAVE TRIED TO PLACE SOLID-FUELED VEHICLES INTO ORBIT FOR
DECADES.  THIS IS NOT ALL THAT EASY BECAUSE THESE MISSILES ARE REALLY
LITTLE MORE THAN FLYING RODS [CANITAS VOLADORAS], BUT THE CASTOR,
WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY ARGENTINA IN 1978, THE SONDA IV DEVELOPED BY
BRAZIL, AND THE JAPANESE LAUNCHING DEVICES DEVELOPED BY ISAS (A
UNIVERSITY SPACE RESEARCH AGENCY) HAVE PROVED TO BE REASONABLY
MANAGEABLE BEASTS.

   THE CASTOR REPRESENTED THE PHASE PREVIOUS TO DESIGNING A SPACESHIP
AND THIS MUST BE THE REASON WHY IT MYSTERIOUSLY DIED IN 1978 AFTER A
SERIES OF INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL TESTS AND AFTER HAVING ALLOWED US TO
REACH AN AGREEMENT FOR A "JOINT-VENTURE" WITH THE FRG TO STUDY THE
ATMOSPHERE.  THE ABSENCE OF MISTAKES BY A DEBTOR COUNTRY MAY BE FATAL.

   WHEN ARGENTINA ONCE AGAIN STARTED TO DISCREETLY THINK ABOUT OUTER
SPACE (1982/83), IT ALREADY HAD ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO CONSIDER LARGER
PROJECTS.  IN FACT, WITH ITS ONE METER DIAMETER TUBE, THE CONDOR COULD
PLACE A 200 KG CARGO IN A LOW POLAR ORBIT OF ONLY 200 KM.

   THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ARGENTINA TO HAVE ONE OR MORE PAIRS
OF EYES IN SPACE SO THAT COULD ASSESS ITS NATURAL RESOURCES, PREDICT
THE WATER FLOW OF RIVERS ON WHICH HYDROELECTRIC DAMS COULD BE BUILT,
DETERMINE WHERE IT COULD FIND OIL AND URANIUM, AND CHEAPLY STOP
ILLEGAL FISHING ON THE CONTINENTAL PLATFORM.  THIS POSSIBILITY COULD
NOT BE ACCEPTED BY SOME PEOPLE.

   BRAZIL, WHICH IS LESS HARD UP, IS ABOUT TO PROGRESS FROM THE SONDA
IV TO THE SONDA V AND HAS OPENLY INVITED US TO JOINTLY DEVELOP THE
SPACESHIP.  WHAT WILL ARGENTINA ANSWER?  "WE WILL"?  OR WILL IT HAVE A
CHAUVINIST ATTITUDE?  WHAT A PITY IT DID NOT ADOPT THAT ATTITUDE NOW
THAT IT IS LETTING THE CONDOR PROJECT DIE IN ITS FIRST STAGE -- IT WAS
NEVER TESTED -- WHEN THE PRESSURE IS NOT AS GREAT AS IT HAS BEEN.
WORST OF IT ALL IS THAT IT IS NOT RECEIVING ANYTHING IN EXCHANGE.

   VERY WELL THEN, IT IS ACCEPTED, THE CONDOR WILL GO NO FURTHER.
WHAT IS LEFT?  VERY LITTLE.  SHOULD WE DEVELOP SATELLITES EXCLUSIVELY
FOR SPACE RESEARCH TO DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE SUN, OR STUDY THE
COSMIC EXPLOSIONS OF X-RAYS.  THESE ISSUES, IF UNAFFECTED BY ECONOMIC
AND POLITICAL FACTORS, DO NOT DISTURB ANYBODY.  THE NASA IS QUITE
WILLING TO GIVE US ROOM, FREE OF CHARGE, ON THEIR ROCKETS FOR THIS
TYPE OF SATELLITES.  THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT WE WILL GAIN EITHER
MONEY OR SPACE SOVEREIGNTY.  THERE IS NO NEED TO POINT OUT THAT ANY
SIMILARITY BETWEEN THIS POSSIBILITY AND AN INDEPENDENT SPACE RESEARCH
PROGRAM, SUCH AS BRAZIL'S, IS MERE COINCIDENCE.

   IN THE 80'S ARGENTINA ALLOWED ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM, WHICH AT THAT
TIME WAS THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE THIRD WORLD, TO BE HINDERED.  NOW IT
IS ALLOWING ITS WINGS TO BE CLIPPED AND, WITH A STUPID SMILE, IS
YIELDING EVERY ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE SOVEREIGNTY IN SPACE.  EACH ATTEMPT
TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY IS LABELLED ARMS ESCALATION BY THOSE CHAMPIONS
OF PEACE, OUR CREDITORS.

   IT IS QUITE TRUE, THE CONDOR II MAY BE A MISSILE, AS A CARGO
AIRCRAFT MAY DROP BOMBS AND A TRUCK MAY BE EQUIPPED WITH ARTILLERY FOR
WAR.  DOES THIS MEAN THAT ARGENTINA MUST STOP MANUFACTURING ALL TYPE
OF VEHICLES?  THIS QUESTION IS NOT POINTLESS IN A COUNTRY THAT REFUSES
TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS.

   QUITO, 30 APR 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] ECUADORAN SOCIAL COMMUNICATIONS
SECRETARY PEDRO SAAD ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT A GROUP OF COLOMBIANS
DRESSED AS MILITARY MEN ON 28 APRIL KIDNAPPED U.S. CITIZEN SCOTT
HEYNDAL, KILLED A COLOMBIAN, AND WOUNDED AN ECUADOREAN.

   HEYNDAL AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE TRAVELING ABOARD A SMALL BOAT ON
THE SAN MIGUEL RIVER IN THE AMAZON REGION WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED WITH
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS BY THE COLOMBIANS FROM A LARGER VESSEL.  


DEV-MUC3-1252 (BOEING)

   NO CITY, NO DATE (FBIS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE ARMY, SEINELDIN
BELIEVES, IS DIVIDED INTO ''NATIONALIST'' AND ''ADMINISTRATIVE'' FACTIONS,
AND WARNS HE ''CAN'T PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THEY CLASH.'' IF A
SOLUTION IS NOT FOUND SOON, ''LIBERALISM OR THE LEFT IS GOING TO MAKE
HEADWAY AND ENCIRCLE US, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE OURSELVES TO
DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS,'' SOMOS OF 14 FEBRUARY REPORTS.

   THE PRESS ALSO REPORTS SEINELDIN'S COMMENTS REGARDING THE UNITED
STATES.  DURING HIS VISIT TO MENDOZA, FOR INSTANCE, HE ADVOCATED A
''CIVILIAN-MILITARY ALLIANCE TO DEFEAT THE TWO IMPERIALISMS,
REPRESENTED BY THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION,'' ACCORDING TO
LA NACION OF 21 MARCH.  SOMOS OF 14 FEBRUARY QUOTES SEINELDIN AS
STATING THAT ''THE WORLD IS DIVIDED, AND WHAT WAS THE THIRD WORLD HAS
BEEN INFILTRATED BY IMPERIALISM AND COMMUNISM.  WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN
HOW THE UNITED STATES BLOCKADED VENEZUELA AND IS NOW TRYING TO DO THE
SAME WITH MEXICO, WHERE IT HAS INSTALLED A SINGLE PARTY.  DRUG
TRAFFICKING WILL BE GIVEN AS AN EXCUSE FOR INVADING IT.''

   LEVEL OF POPULAR SUPPORT

   LA PRENSA OF 13 MARCH ANALYZES A SURVEY ON SEINELDIN'S POPULARITY
CONDUCTED BY THE DEMOSKOPIA INSTITUTE FOR MARKET RESEARCH AND
POLITICAL STUDIES.  ACCORDING TO THE STUDY, ''SEINELDIN IS BETTER
KNOWN THAN MANY POLITICIANS'' AND CABINET MEMBERS, SINCE 91 PERCENT OF
THE POPULATION KNOWS OR HAS HEARD ABOUT HIM.  THE SURVEY SHOWS 20
PERCENT OF THE POPULATION APPROVES OF HIM, 40 PERCENT DISAPPROVES,
WHILE 21 PERCENT IS UNDECIDED.  THE DEMOSKOPIA STUDY ALSO POINTS OUT
THAT, ALTHOUGH SEINELDIN MAY HAVE ''HALF OF PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST
HIM,'' THERE IS ''A LARGE PERCENTAGE THAT DOES NOT YET HAVE A DEFINITE
OPINION,'' AND THAT ''DEPENDING ON SEINELDIN'S POLITICAL SKILL AND ON
HOW MUCH THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE,' HE COULD
INCREASE HIS FOLLOWING, PARTICULARLY FROM AMONG THE UNDECIDED.

   ACCORDING TO AN OPINION POLL CONDUCTED IN LATE FEBRUARY BY THE
UNION STUDY CENTER FOR THE NEW MAJORITY AND REPORTED IN LA NACION OF
23 MARCH, SEINELDIN IS SEEN IN A MORE POSITIVE LIGHT OUTSIDE THE
CAPITAL AND GREATER BUENOS AIRES, AMONG PEOPLE WITH LOWER LEVELS OF
EDUCATION, AND AMONG SUPPORTERS OF THE RULING JUSTICIALIST PARTY.
MORE SPECIFIALLY:.

   GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION--IN THE CITY OF BUENOS AIRES, SEINELDIN
RECEIVED 14 PERCENT FAVORABLE AND 40 PERCENT NEGATIVE RATINGS; IN
GREATER BUENOS AIRES, 26 AND 32 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY; AND IN THE
NORTHWEST REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY, 41 PERCENT FAVORABLE VERSUS 30
PERCENT UNFAVORABLE.

   LEVEL OF EDUCATION--IN THE CAPITAL AND GREATER BUENOS AIRES,
SEINELDIN HAS A 19 PERCENT APPROVAL RATING AMONG THOSE WHO COMPLETED
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 14 PERCENT AMONG THOSE WHO COMPLETED SECONDARY
SCHOOL, AND 10 PERCENT AMONG THOSE WITH COLLEGE DEGREES.

   POLITICAL AFFILIATION--SURVEY PARTICIPANTS WHO VOTED FOR THE
RADICAL PARTY DURING THE LAST NATIONAL ELECTIONS GIVE SEINELDIN A 7
PERCENT APPROVAL RATING, THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THE UNITED LEFT GIVE HIM
8 PERCENT, AND AMONG THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THE MENEM-DUHALDE TICKET HIS
APPROVAL RATE IS 25 PERCENT.

   MILITARY CONCERNS

   MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LOW SALARIES AND THE SHARP
DECREASE IN PURCHASING POWER, ACCORDING TO AN 11 MARCH ARTICLE IN LA
PRENSA.  THEIR DISSATISFACTION, WHICH WAS PUBLICIZED IN A FLIER WHICH
APPEARED IN SEVERAL PROVINCIAL GARRISONS, WAS DISCUSSED DURING
SEINELDIN'S MEETING WITH COMMISSIONED AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS IN
SANTA FE, ACCORDING TO SOMOS OF 14 FEBRUARY.

   THE POSSIBILITY OF A SOCIAL EXPLOSION AND THE RELUCTANCE OF THE
''CARAPINTADAS'' TO INTERVENE WERE DISCUSSED DURING SEINELDIN'S
MEETINGS IN ROSARIO, ACCORDING TO THE 14 FEBRUARY ISSUE OF SOMOS.
''WE CANNOT ENGAGE IN REPRESSION, AND THAT COULD CAUSE A LOT OF
PROBLEMS FOR THE SECURITY FORCES,'' AN ''AUTHORIZED SPOKEMAN''
REPORTEDLY CONFIDED.  IF THE ECONOMY DETERIORATES AND SOCIAL UNREST
ENSUES, ''UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL THE ARMED FORCES BE INCLINED TO
TAKE THE PLACE OF THE POLICE FORCES IN GUARDING SUPERMARKETS OR ANY
PLACE NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS 'VITAL TO THE NATION,'' ACCORDING TO
THE 11 MARCH ISSUE OF LA PRENSA.


DEV-MUC3-1253 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE HIGH COMMAND OF
THE ARMED FORCES IS ANALYZING NEWS REPORTS ABOUT COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA
PEREZ, PRESIDENT OF AN AUTONOMOUS INSTITUTION, HAVING SAID THAT THE OFFICER
INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF SIX JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS "FOLLOWED ORDERS
FROM ABOVE".

   OCHOA MADE THOSE COMMENTS ON A U.S. TELEVISION NEWSCAST AT A TIME
WHEN SEVERAL MEMBERS OF [THE U.S.] CONGRESS WANT TO CUT AID TO EL
SALVADOR AND ARE CONDUCTING THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CASE.  THE
RESULTS OF THEIR INVESTIGATION WILL BE KNOWN NEXT WEEK.

   DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS CONFIRMED ON THE
MORNING OF 24 APRIL THAT THE HIGH COMMAND IS ANALYZING OCHOA'S
DECLARATIONS AND STRESSED THAT VERSIONS SUCH AS THE ONE ATTRIBUTED TO
THE OFFICIAL USUALLY COME FROM "INTERESTED PARTIES."

   LARIOS, QUESTIONED WHEN HE BID FAREWELL TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI, WHO LEFT FOR NICARAGUA ON 24 APRIL, SAID THAT "THE CASE IS
IN THE COURTS AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE NEW EVIDENCE MAY APPROACH THEM TO
CONTRIBUTE WHAT THEY HAVE SO THAT IT MAY BE SOLVED."

   "BOTH THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT WANT EVERYTHING TO BE CLARIFIED
WITHIN A FAIR AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK," HE SAID.

   ARMY OFFICERS WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS SAID ON 24 APRIL THAT
"THE COMMENTS MADE BY OCHOA, CONTROVERSIAL POLITICIAN AND SOLDIER
KNOWN FOR HIS FREQUENT OUTBURSTS, HAVE NO BASIS BECAUSE HE HAS NO
ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL ARMED FORCES SOURCES DUE TO HIS RETIRED
STATUS."

   HOWEVER, THE INFORMERS HAVE SAID THAT "WHAT OCHOA SAID NOT ONLY
DAMAGES THE ARMY'S IMAGE, BUT THAT OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WHILE IT
CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEFAMATION CAMPAIGN BEING CARRIED OUT ABROAD BY
INTERESTED PARTIES, AMONG THEM, THE LEADERS OF THE FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT-REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT]."

   THEY ADDED THAT OCHOA'S DECLARATION, "MADE WITHOUT PRESENTING ANY
PROOF, ENDANGERS THE MILITARY AID THAT THE UNITED STATES OFFERS TO EL
SALVADOR AND, AT THE SAME TIME, FAVORS THE INTERNATIONALIST LEFT WHICH
INTENDS TO PLAY THE LAST CARD IT HAS TO ASSAULT POWER IN THIS
COUNTRY."

   THE POLITICIANS' IMMEDIATE REACTION TO OCHOA PEREZ' COMMENTS WAS TO
DEMAND THAT HE BE MORE SPECIFIC IN HIS ACCUSATION.  PDC [CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY] LEADER EDUARDO COLINDRES SAID IN A PRESS CONFERENCE
THAT "OCHOA PEREZ HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION OF NAMING" THOSE OF HIS
COMRADES-IN-ARMS HE IMPLICATES IN THE DEATH OF THE JESUITS, SINCE THE
VERSION HE GAVE TO THE TELEVISION PROGRAM THAT INTERVIEWED HIM IS
VAGUE.

   THE POLITICIAN SAID: "IF HE KNOWS SOMETHING, IT IS TIME THAT HE
BRING IT OUT INTO A PUBLIC LIGHT SO THAT JUSTICE AUTHORITIES MAY TAKE
THE APPROPRIATE PATHS."

   MEANWHILE, IN MANAGUA, SPANISH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ATTENDED
VIOLETA CHAMORRO'S INAUGURATION SAID THAT THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED BY
THE SLUGGISH MANNER IN WHICH THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE JESUITS' CASE
ARE APPARENTLY BEING CARRIED OUT.  THEY SAID THAT THEY MIGHT MENTION
THE TOPIC DURING THE MEETINGS THEY WILL HOLD WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
IN NICARAGUA.

   REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON D.C. QUOTE THE LEFTIST LEADER OF THE FDR,
GUILLERMO MANUEL UNGO, AS SAYING THAT "HIS EFFORTS IN THE AMERICAN
CAPITAL TO EXPOSE THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, ARE A SUCCESS."

   THE SOURCES SAID THAT UNGO AND HIS MARXIST-LENINIST ALLIES WANT THE
U.S. SENATE TO STOP GIVING MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR.  THE SOURCES
ALSO SAID THAT UNGO DISCREDITS THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT AND FAVORS
THE LEGAL RECOGNITION OF THE REBEL GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   "EVERYTHING SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE LEFTIST INTERNATIONALISTS
HAVE UNLEASHED A NEW DISINFORMATION OFFENSIVE AGAINST EL SALVADOR WITH
THE AID OF BAD SALVADORANS," THE SOURCES SAID.

   REFERRING TO OTHER COMMUNIST MOVES IN THE COUNTRY, GENERAL LARIOS
SAID THAT THE LOCAL LEFTISTS ARE PREPARING TO STAGE TERRORIST ACTIONS
AND STREET DISTURBANCES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS UNDER THE PRETEXT OF
COMMEMORATING LABOR DAY.

   LARIOS URGED THE FMLN-FDR TERRORISTS TO REFRAIN FROM PERPETRATING
VIOLENT ACTIONS, THUS CREATING AN ADEQUATE CLIMATE FOR THE "DIALOGUE"
ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO BE HELD ON 3 MAY.  "OTHERWISE, THE
TERRORISTS WOULD BE VIOLATING THE COMMITMENTS THEY MADE," LARIOS
POINTED OUT.

   IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED FROM COSTA RICA THAT FMLN-FDR
LEADERS HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAVE PREPARED ANOTHER OFFENSIVE FOR THE
NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS ELICITED STRONG REJECTION BY
VARIOUS SECTORS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 MAY 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] FOLLOWING A
MEETING OF THE GENERAL STAFF WITH ALL THE BRIGADE AND DETACHMENT COMMANDERS,
THE ARMED FORCES TODAY ISSUED A PUBLIC COMMUNIQUE DESCRIBING THE RECENT
STATEMENTS BY COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ AS IRRESPONSIBLE AND
TENDENTIOUS.  IN PARTS, THE COMMUNIQUE POINTED OUT THAT:

   1.  WE EMPHATICALLY AND CATEGORICALLY REJECT THE RECENT STATEMENTS
BY DISCHARGED COL. SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ PUBLISHED IN THE LOCAL AND
FOREIGN MEDIA.  THESE STATEMENTS ARE IRRESPONSIBLE AND TENDENTIOUS AND
SEEK TO CREATE CONFUSION AND DISTRUST IN THE NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES BY TRYING TO INVOLVE THE MEMBERS OF THE HIGH
COMMAND IN THE REGRETTABLE CASE OF THE DEATH OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND
THEIR WORKERS.

   2.  WE DEMAND THAT BOTH COL. OCHOA PEREZ, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER
PERSON HAVING ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD TO CLARIFYING THIS CASE
OR ANY OTHER CASE, PRESENT IT TO THE CORRESPONDING TRIBUNALS AND NOT
TRY TO OBTAIN POLITICAL PROFIT BASED ON ALLEGED STATEMENTS THAT ARE
ADDED ON TO THE CAMPAIGN OF DISINFORMATION THAT IS BEING CARRIED OUT
IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER BY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARXIST-LENINIST
TERRORISTS.

   3.  WE CONDEMN SUCH IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS AS THEY SEEK TO
UNDERMINE THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE, AND ONLY FAVOR THE DARK
AND NEFARIOUS INTERESTS OF THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY.

   IN CONCLUDING, THE ARMED FORCES COMMUNIQUE REAFFIRMS ITS COMMITMENT
TO THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE COUNTRY AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND
POINTED OUT THAT THE INSTITUTION IS RULED BY SOLID PROFESSIONAL,
MORAL, AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLES.  WITH THIS STATEMENT, ALL THE
COMMANDERS GIVE THEIR UNCONDITIONAL VOTE OF CONFIDENCE TO THE MILITARY
HIGH COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES.

LAUNCHED SEVERAL ATTACKS ON SEVERAL POINTS OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL
TONIGHT CAUSING BLACKOUTS AND AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF DEAD, IN
ADDITION TO CAUSING PANIC AMONG THE CITIZENRY.

   MILITARY SPOKESMEN REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS BEGAN AT

THE SOUTHERN SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL, AND MILITARY POSITIONS IN THE
WEALTHY ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE THE SHERATON HOTEL IS LOCATED.

   A HEAVY BARRAGE OF RIFLE FIRE AND EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD FOR
APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR IN THE SAN RAMON AREA, LOCATED IN THE
NORTHWESTERN SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR, WHILE ONE AIR FORCE HELICOPTER
OVERFLEW THE CITY.

   THERE WERE ALSO REPORTS OF ATTACKS ON A MILITARY POST AT THE
CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL AND OTHER POSITIONS ON THE NORTHWESTERN
OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL.

   SIMULTANEOUSLY, URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS ATTACKED THE CIVIL
DEFENSE GROUP IN THE COSTA RICA NEIGHBORHOOD OF SOUTHERN SAN SALVADOR.

   SEVERAL ELECTRIC POLES WERE BROUGHT DOWN IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE

BY THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN: WE ANNOUNCE THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 1
MAY AND THE EARLY MORNING OF 2 MAY, OUR FORCES CONDUCTED SEVERAL MILITARY
OPERATIONS IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER CITIES OF THE COUNTRY IN RESPONSE TO:

   1. THE PREVAILING TOTAL IMPUNITY OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN
VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE STANDSTILL REACHED IN
THE TRIAL, THE EVIDENT COVER UP OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THE
ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE RELEASE OF THE GROUP OF
KIDNAPPERS, AND THE RECENT MURDER OF A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND A
COOPERATIVE LEADER.

   2.  THE MILITARY OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN RURAL
AREAS WITH INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND ARRESTS OF CIVILIANS.

   3.  THE ARROGANT AND BOASTFUL ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
MILITARY BECAUSE OF AN ALLEGED WEAKNESS SHOWN BY THE FMLN, WHICH
OBSTRUCTS THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS.

   4.  THE UNPOPULAR ECONOMIC MEASURES AND THE PLANS TO CARRY OUT THE
BIGGEST ECONOMIC FRAUD AND ACT OF CORRUPTION IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY
WITH THE PRIVATIZATION OF BANKS.

   WE BELIEVE THAT:

   1.  THE U.S. CONGRESSIONAL PLAN TO CUT ONLY 50 PERCENT OF THE
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT ENOUGH.  ANY ASSISTANCE
TO TERRORIST ARMED FORCES ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO WAR AND REDUCES THE
POSSIBILITY FOR A SHORT-TERM CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT.

   2.  AS LONG AS THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES FOR THE ENTIRE SOCIETY, AS
LONG AS CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE MILITARY GO UNPUNISHED, AND AS LONG AS
REPRESSION DOES NOT STOP, WAR WILL CONTINUE.

   FINALLY WE REITERATE OUR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE THE NEGOTIATION
PROCESS.  CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE ALREADY PRESENTED OUR POSITIONS TO THE
GOVERNMENT AND ARE AWAITING ITS REPLY SO THAT WE CAN START HOLDING THE
NEGOTIATIONS.  [SIGNED] GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN

   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 2 MAY 90 (NOTIMEX) -- [TEXT] THE 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT [M - 19] TODAY ACCUSED THE COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF
ASSASSINATING M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO.

   "WE ATTRIBUTE PIZARRO'S DEATH TO THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY SERVICES,"
SAID M-19 DIRECTORATE MEMBER RAFAEL VERGARA DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE
HELD IN MEXICO CITY.

   THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF THE FORMER REBEL GROUP
TURNED POLITICAL PARTY HAS PROPOSED THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL
GROUP TO PERMANENTLY PROTECT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' LIVES.

   MIGUEL MARIN, ALSO A MEMBER OF THE M-19'S DIRECTORATE, POINTED OUT
THE NEED FOR VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO DESIGNATE
POLITICAL PERSONALITIES WHO WOULD ACCOMPANY EACH OF THE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES ON THEIR CAMPAIGNS.

   "WE INTEND TO CHECK THE TRIGGERS OF THE COLOMBIAN OLIGARCHY, WHO
ARE TO BLAME FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN
THE PAST FEW YEARS," THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT'S REPRESENTATIVES SAID.

   THEY DENIED THAT THE M-19 IS IN FAVOR OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, BUT
ADVOCATED THE LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS AND THE NONEXTRADITION OF DRUG
PRODUCERS.

   THE M-19 MEMBERS SAID THAT THE CLARIFICATION OF THEIR TOP LEADER'S
DEATH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CREDIBILITY OF VIRGILIO BARCO'S REGIME.
THEY SAID THAT PIZARRO'S BASIC PROPOSALS TO PACIFY THE COUNTRY WILL BE
TAKEN UP BY ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, WHO REPLACED PIZARRO AS THE M-19'S
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

   THEY ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP PUT AN END TO THE
ARMS TRAFFIC TO COLOMBIA, BECAUSE IN 1989 FOREIGN INVESTMENT INCREASED
BY 148 PERCENT OVER THAT OF 1988.

   "WHAT COLOMBIA NEEDS IS TO ATTAIN PEACE WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE.  FOR
THIS REASON, IT IS NECESSARY TO TALK AND NEGOTIATE WITH ALL OF THE
INFLUENTIAL SECTORS IN COLOMBIA, INCLUDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,"
VERGARA AND MARIN POINTED OUT.  


DEV-MUC3-1260 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A GROUP PURPORTEDLY
REPRESENTING YOUNG SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS HAS CALLED FOR A PURGE
OF THE ARMED FORCES HERE, ACCUSING THEIR SUPERIORS OF INVOLVEMENT IN
THE MASSACRE OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.

   THE CALL CAME WEDNESDAY IN THE WAKE OF A BOLD OFFENSIVE BY LEFTIST
GUERRILLAS WHO ATTACKED STRATEGIC TARGETS ACROSS THE CAPITAL,
INCLUDING THE RESIDENCE OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, IN A SHOW OF
FORCE BEFORE PEACE TALKS.

   THE STATEMENT DISTRIBUTED TO NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WAS MADE IN THE
NAME OF A "COMMANDO OF YOUNG OFFICERS."  IT GAVE NO NAMES BUT SAID THE
GROUP WAS FORMED SECRETLY AMONG OFFICERS FED UP WITH CORRUPTION BY A
SMALL GROUP OF MILITARY LEADERS.

   IF AUTHENTIC, THE STATEMENT WOULD MARK THE FIRST TIME SINCE A 1979
MILITARY COUP THAT A GROUP OF JUNIOR OFFICERS HAD BROKEN RANKS WITH EL
SALVADOR'S MILITARY LEADERSHIP.

   "TODAY MORE THAN EVER, ALL THE OFFICERS WHO TRULY WANT TO SAVE OUR
INSTITUTION, MUST DEMAND AND EXACT PROFOUND CHANGES AND A GENERAL
PURGE AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ARMED FORCES," THE STATEMENT SAID.

   THE STATEMENT BLAMED A THREATENED LOSS OF U.S. MILITARY AID ON A
FEW CORRUPT OFFICERS WHOM IT HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE "EXECRABLE"
ASSASSINATIONS OF SIX ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS DURING A REBEL OFFENSIVE
IN NOVEMBER.

   EL SALVADOR IS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE 315.4 MILLION DOLLARS IN U.S.
AID THIS YEAR, 85 MILLION DOLLARS OF IT IN MILITARY AID.  BUT THE U.S.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS VOTED TO CUT MILITARY AID IN HALF AND
U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES BAKER HAS WARNED THAT AID TO EL SALVADOR
WILL DEPEND ON PROGRESS IN THE PRIESTS' CASE.

   THE PRIESTS, THEIR HOUSEKEEPER AND HER DAUGHTER WERE MURDERED IN
THEIR RESIDENCE NOVEMBER 16 IN THE MIDST OF PROLONGED AND BLOODY
GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN THE CITY.  NINE MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE KILLINGS BUT MR. CRISTIANI HAS
EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THEY WILL BE CONVICTED.

   "IT IS TRULY SAD AND INFURIATING FOR US THAT THE LOSS OF PRESTIGE
OF THE ARMED FORCES HAS GROWN SO MUCH THAT INTERNATIONALLY WE ARE SEEN
AS THE ONES TO BLAME FOR THE SITUATION OUR COUNTRY IS IN," SAID THE
STATEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO THE YOUNG OFFICERS.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN), MEANWHILE,
ALSO SAID ITS ATTACKS IN SAN SALVADOR EARLY WEDNESDAY WERE TO PROTEST
THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN PROSECUTING MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY FOR THE
MASSACRE OF THE PRIESTS.

   BUT ANALYSTS SAID THE RENEWED FIGHTING APPEARED INTENDED AS A SHOW
OF FORCE AHEAD OF U.N.-MEDIATED PEACE [WORD INDISTINCT] THIS MONTH,
WHICH SEEK TO END A DECADE-LONG CIVIL WAR THAT HAS LEFT MORE THAN
70,000 DEAD.

   IN THE FIGHTING EARLY WEDNESDAY, AT LEAST SEVEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS
WERE KILLED AND 18 WERE WOUNDED, AN ARMY SPOKESMAN SAID.  THERE WERE
NO CASUALTIES IN THE ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE AND MR.
CRISTIANI WAS NOT AT HOME AT THE TIME, THE SPOKESMAN SAID.

   THE REBELS RETREATED TO THEIR STRONGHOLD AROUND THE SAN SALVADOR
VOLCANO JUST NORTH OF THE CAPITAL AFTER THE ATTACKS IN UPPER CLASS
NEIGHBORHOODS.

   THE UNITED STATES SHARPLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS AND CALLED ON THE
REBELS TO DEMONSTRATE THEY CAN WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR
TO END THE WAR.

   "WE CONDEMN THE OUTRAGEOUS VIOLENCE BY THE FMLN," SAID STATE
DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN RICHARD BOUCHER.  "THE FMLN HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT
IT CAN DESTROY THE SALVADORAN ECONOMY AND KILL SALVADORAN CITIZENS."

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] THE YOUNG MILITARY
OFFICERS WHO HAVE CIRCULATED A 5-PAGE LETTER OUTLINING THEIR VIEWS CONTEND
THAT THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE NEGLECT IN CORRECTING WRONGDOINGS
COMMITTED BY THE U.S. ADVISERS AND EMBASSY ARE THE MAIN PROBLEMS KEEPING THE
COUNTRY MIRED IN WAR. THE OFFICERS ADD THAT THEY DO NOT TRUST THE CURRENT
U.S. AMBASSADOR, WHOM THEY ACCUSE OF BETRAYING TRUTH AND JUSTICE IN THE
COUNTRY IN CONNECTION WITH THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS.

   THE OFFICERS NOTE THE DIPLOMAT'S POSITION REGARDING THE CASE OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS; HOW HE FAILED TO DENOUNCE A COLONEL WHO ACCIDENTALLY
DISCOVERED THE CULPRITS AND HOW, LATELY, HE HAS WARNED THE HIGH
COMMAND ABOUT SOME INFORMATION THAT WAS GOING TO BE MADE PUBLIC BY A
U.S. NETWORK.

   THE LETTER, WHICH WAS RELEASED DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS AND IS
DATED 1 MAY, EXPRESSES THE YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS SUPPORT FOR COLONEL
SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ, AFTER THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WITH THE BLESSING
OF SEVERAL COMMANDERS, DECIDED TO TAKE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF CEL
[LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE] TO TASK PUBLICLY.  IN
THEIR LETTER, THE OFFICERS STATE THAT THEY AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE
FORMER MILITARY COMMANDER REGARDING WHICH SENIOR OFFICERS GIVE ORDERS
TO JUNIOR OFFICERS.

   WE ARE OBEDIENT AND NONCONFRONTATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY WE CONTINUE
TO OBEY ORDERS FROM SUPERIORS, BUT THIS MUST STOP WHEN THE VIOLATION
OF PRINCIPLES AND RIGHTS ARE INVOLVED, SAYS THE CALL FROM THE YOUNG
OFFICERS TO THE PRESIDENT AND HIGH COMMAND.

   THE EXTENSIVE DOCUMENT DELIVERED TO THE MEDIA BY THE SELF-STYLED
DOMINGO MONTERROSA LIVES MOVEMENT SAYS THAT TWO OF THE OFFICERS IT
MENTIONS WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR POSTS IN THE MILITARY ORDER OF 30
APRIL.  THE YOUNG OFFICERS PROVIDE NO FURTHER DETAILS BUT MAKE SOME
ALLUSIONS TO MISSIONS CONDUCTED WHILE THEY DID THEIR DUTIES.

   THE DOCUMENT SAYS THAT SOME OF THE SENIOR OFFICERS WHO ARE
OBTAINING MONEY ILLEGALLY MUST STOP AND MENTIONS THE NAMES OF FORMER
MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE NOW LIVING AND ENJOYING THEIR WEALTH IN
EXILE.  THE DOCUMENT SAYS THAT THE CONTRADICTION RAISED BY THE ABOVE
IS THE LUCK OF SOME GENTLEMEN OFFICERS WHO, AT THE END OF THEIR
SERVICE, LIVE ABROAD AND ENJOY THEIR POSITIONS WITHOUT ANY QUESTION.
THE DOCUMENT ASKS HOW SOME FORMER OFFICERS ARE ABLE TO LIVE SO WELL
WHEN WE KNOW THEY GRADUATED FROM OUR MILITARY ALMA MATER.

   THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IS ALSO EXAMINED IN THEIR LETTER.
THEY NOTE THAT THE IDENTITY OF THE CULPRITS BECAME KNOWN SHORTLY AFTER
THE MURDER, BUT SOME OF THE SENIOR OFFICERS WITHHELD IMPORTANT
INFORMATION FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND ARMED FORCES
COMMANDER IN CHIEF.  A FEW HOURS AFTER THE MURDER, MANY OF US
SUSPECTED WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  WE, THE YOUNG OFFICERS, HAVE THE BEST
SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND MANY OF US DID NOT THINK THAT THE CASE
WOULD HAVE ANY MAJOR IMPACT BECAUSE THE ACTIVISM OF THE PRIESTS WITH
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL FRONT [FMLN] WAS WELL-KNOWN.  HOWEVER,
THERE WAS CAUSE FOR CONCERN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CRIME BECAME
KNOWN.  THE PRIESTS' MURDER WAS DESCRIBED AS IRRATIONAL AND SENSELESS
BECAUSE OPEN FIGHTING AGAINST TERRORISM IS ONE THING AND THE STRUGGLE
AGAINST THE IDEOLOGISTS IS ANOTHER.

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC MADE UP THE STORY ABOUT THE
FMLN HATCHING A PLOT TO MURDER THE SAN SALVADOR BISHOPS IN AN ATTEMPT
TO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE KILLING OF THE PRIESTS, THE LETTER
SAYS.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COULD NOT BE REACHED FOR COMMENT ABOUT
THIS. AS STATED BY THE YOUNG OFFICERS, WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
IDEA WAS RAISED, IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE CREDIBLE.
THIS WAS TREATED AS A CHILDISH AND ILLOGICAL WAY OUT.  THE GROSS LIE
MADE UP BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS NEVER CONSIDERED A PRACTICAL
OPTION, THE DOCUMENT SAYS.

   THE SELF-STYLED DOMINGO MONTERROSA LIVES MOVEMENT HAS SENT THE
LETTER TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, THE ASSEMBLY, AND THE ARMED
FORCES HIGH COMMAND, ASKING THEM TO MEASURE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE
POSITION ASSUMED BY THE U.S. EMBASSY AND VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE
COUNTRY REGARDING MILITARY AID.  THE YOUNG OFFICERS HAVE TAKEN THE
NAME OF THE CHARISMATIC OFFICER WHO DIED WHEN HIS HELICOPTER WAS
ATTACKED WHILE FLYING OVER THE AREA OF CACAOPERA, IN THE NORTHERN PART
OF THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN REGION.

   IN THEIR EXTENSIVE DOCUMENT THE YOUNG OFFICERS ASK PRESIDENT
CRISTINI NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY REPORTS FROM THE HIGH COMMAND MEMBERS
OF LA TANDONA [NAME GIVEN TO 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY].

   NO CITY, NO DATE (FBIS) -- [TEXT] SAN SALVADOR DOMESTIC SERVICE IN
SPANISH AT 1808 GMT ON 3 MAY BEGINS TO BROADCAST LIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   CRISTIANI BEGINS BY SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO PUT
TOGETHER A VIABLE AGENDA FOR ITS UPCOMING MEETING WITH THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SO THAT SOME HEADWAY CAN BE
MADE IN THE TALKS.  HE ADDS: "FROM WHAT WE CAN FORESEE, WE HOPE THE
DIRECT MEETINGS WILL BEGIN IN A WEEK AND A HALF, OR SOMEWHERE AROUND
THERE.  THAT IS WHEN WE THINK THEY COULD START....  IN GENERAL TERMS,
WE DO BELIEVE PROGRESS WILL BE MADE AND THAT WE WILL ADVANCE QUITE
RAPIDLY."

   IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION REGARDING A LETTER FROM AN UNNAMED GROUP
OF YOUNG MILITARY OFFICERS ADVOCATING A PURGE OF THE MILITARY AND
SUPPORTING CRITICISMS MADE BY FORMER ARMY COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA
PEREZ, CRISTIANI SAYS: "I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED ANONYMOUS LETTERS OR
NOTES.  THE FACT THAT IT IS ANONYMOUS CASTS SOME DOUBT ON THE
INTENTIONS BEHIND IT OR ABOUT THE GROUP THAT COULD BE SENDING IT.
POSING AS YOUNG OFFICERS IS EASY TO DO.  THIS COULD HAVE COME FROM THE
FMLN -- MAKING AN ISSUE OF ALL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- OR
FROM ANY OTHER GROUP."

   REGARDING THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE ON THE REBELS' RECENT MILITARY
OFFENSIVE, HE STATES: "I READ THE COMMUNIQUE AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS FMLN COMMUNIQUES I HAVE SEEN TO
DATE....  I FEEL THAT THIS WAS A WAY TO SEEK NOTORIETY THROUGH THE
NEWS.  THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE REASONS.  THE OTHER REASON COULD BE
THAT THEY ARE HAVING PROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES....  SOME OF THEM VIEW
THE DIALOGUE AS SOMETHING SERIOUS WHILE OTHERS DO NOT, AND IT COULD BE
THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE RESULTING IN THESE IRRATIONAL ADVENTURES BY
THE FMLN."

   TURNING TO RECENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CRITICISM CHARGING SLOWNESS IN
THE HANDLING OF THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF THOSE INVOLVED IN
THE JESUIT MURDER CASE, CRISTIANI SAYS: "AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE, I CANNOT
SPEED UP, SLOW DOWN, OR ALTER THE JUDGE'S DECISIONS.  IN NO DEMOCRACY
CAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE DICTATE ORDERS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  THE
SAME HAPPENS IN THE UNITED STATES AS IN ANY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.
I BELIEVE THAT AS FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE -- ALTHOUGH THERE IS
MUCH URGENCY IN SEEING THIS TRIAL COMPLETED; THERE ARE GREAT
EXPECTATIONS -- THAT THE JUDGE IS DUTY BOUND TO CONTINUE WITH THE
JUDICIAL PROCEDURES STIPULATED BY SALVADORAN LAW."  HE POINTS OUT THAT
THE PROSECUTION OF GENERAL NORIEGA IN THE UNITED STATES IS ALSO TAKING
A LONG TIME.

   REGARDING A REPORTED FMLN ATTACK ON HIS RESIDENCE IN SAN SALVADOR
YESTERDAY, CRISTIANI SAYS: "I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE PERSON WAS WHO
REPORTED AN ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE, EITHER THE OFFICIAL
OR THE PRIVATE ONE.  NEITHER OF THEM WAS ATTACKED, THOUGH THERE COULD
HAVE BEEN SOME INFORMATION THAT SUCH AN ATTACK WAS EXPECTED.  AN FMLN
COLUMN WAS DISPERSED IN AREAS CLOSE TO THE TWO RESIDENCES."

   QUESTIONED ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON THE GOVERNMENT OF A POSSIBLE CUT IN U.S.
GOVERNMENT AID TO EL SALVADOR, CRISTIANI RESPONDS:  "WELL, I THINK THAT
FIRST OF ALL, THE EFFECTS OF A REDUCTION OR CUT OF AID WOULD BE TWOFOLD.
FIRST, I THINK IT WOULD BE A NEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE
OBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED; AND THAT A CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY
SOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING
OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT, THEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY
VICTORY IS NOW CLOSER.  AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO END THE
CONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL DIALOGUE.  SECOND, OBVIOUSLY
THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND WILL NOT STANDBY WITH A WEAKENED
DEFENSE.  THEREFORE, THIS MEANS REALLOCATING RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE USED
FOR OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- SOCIAL PROGRAMS, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL
PROGRAMS -- ...  FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES."

   RETURNING THE JESUITS MURDER CASE, CRISTIANI IS ASKED IF THE MILITARY
HIGH COMMAND IS BEING INVESTIGATED.  HE SAYS:  "FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY
THAT THE HIGH COMMAND -- AND THIS IS JUST MY OWN POINT OF VIEW -- WAS
INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATION.  THE HIGH
COMMAND MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE INVESTIGATION TO BE WITHIN THE ARMED
FORCES, AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS NO PRECEDENT IN THE PAST WITH RESPECT TO
INVESTIGATING MILITARY UNITS....  IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT
BY SUPPORTING THE INVESTIGATION AND OPENING UP THE ARMED FORCES SO THAT THEY
CAN BE INVESTIGATED IN THIS CASE, THEY WOULD HAVE DONE SO IF THERE WERE SOME
INVOLVEMENT ON THEIR PART."

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [MODERATOR] JUAN AMADEO CABRERA FROM LA NOTICIA.

   [CABRERA] MR. PRESIDENT, IF THE COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE YOUNG
MILITARY OFFICERS IS TRUE, IF IT IS TRUE THAT THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE
ARMED FORCES, WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK FOR THE ARMED FORCES AND FOR YOUR
GOVERNMENT?

   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE SOME SPECULATION WOULD BE REQUIRED.  I
BELIEVE THAT AS AN ANONYMOUS LETTER, IT CANNOT BE GIVEN THE CREDIT IT
DESERVES, IF IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO IS COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE.
IN THIS REGARD, I REPEAT THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN WILLING TO
CONDUCT A PROCESS OF PROFESSIONALIZING AND MODERNIZING.  THEY ARE
TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR INSTITUTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

   [MODERATOR] LUISA MELGAR FROM TELEPRENSA.

   [MELGAR] MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY THE FMLN CARRIED OUT DIFFERENT
ARMED ACTIONS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED
BY THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND JUSTIFIED THE ACTIONS BECAUSE OF ALLEGED
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, REPRESSION, AND LACK OF SECURITY FOR
CIVILIANS.  HOW DO YOU VIEW THESE ACTIONS JUST WHEN THE TALKS ARE
ABOUT TO BEGIN?

   [CRISTIANI] I READ THE COMMUNIQUE AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS
ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS FMLN COMMUNIQUES I HAVE SEEN TO DATE.  IT
IS A JUSTIFICATION THAT IS NOT VERY JUSTIFIABLE, I WOULD SAY.  I
BELIEVE THE EVENTS ON 1 MAY IN THE MORNING CAN CLEARLY BE UNDERSTOOD.
ALL GROUPS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE WERE ABLE TO MARCH PEACEFULLY.
THEIR FREEDOMS ARE NOT BEING REPRESSED. I IMAGINE YOU HAVE ALL HEARD
AND SEEN WHAT THEY SAID AND DID AND THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS.  I FEEL
THAT THIS WAS A WAY TO SEEK NOTORIETY THROUGH THE NEWS.  THIS COULD BE
ONE OF THE REASONS.  THE OTHER REASON COULD BE THAT THEY ARE HAVING
PROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES.  WE HAVE INFORMATION TELLING US THAT THERE
ARE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE DIFFERENT GROUPS.  SOME OF THEM VIEW THE
DIALOGUE AS SOMETHING SERIOUS, WHILE OTHERS DO NOT, AND IT COULD BE
THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE RESULTING IN THESE IRRATIONAL ADVENTURES BY
THE FMLN.  I FEEL THAT AT THIS STAGE OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, THEIR
ACTIONS ARE COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIABLE.  THAT IS NOT ALL.  THEY HAVE
EVEN VIOLATED WHAT THEY HAVE CALLED UNILATERAL GESTURES MADE IN THE
PAST.  THIS SHOWS THE LACK OF SERIOUSNESS AND SINCERITY IN ALL OF
THEM, OR SOME OF THEM, CONCERNING THE OBJECTIVES WE ARE TRYING TO
ACHIEVE WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.

   [CRISTIANI] GUILLERMO PENATE FROM EL DIARIO DE HOY.

   [PENATE] THERE ARE SOME LABOR GROUPS THAT WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN
THE DELEGATION THAT WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS WITH THE FMLN.
COULD THIS NOT BE SOME SORT OF DISADVANTAGE FOR THE OFFICIAL
DELEGATION, BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE GROUPS COULD GAIN STRENGTH?

   [CRISTIANI] I THINK THAT IS TRUE.  SOME GROUPS HAVE ASKED TO BE
INCLUDED IN THE DELEGATION.  I BELIEVE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE
DIFFERENT GROUPS IS STIPULATED IN THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS.  WE HAVE
ALREADY EXPLAINED HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN ALLOW FOR THE PARTICIPATION
OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO
CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS FOR THE MOST PART.  I BELIEVE THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF
MEMBERS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED IN THE
PAST.

   [MODERATOR] RAUL BELTRAN FROM RADIO CADENA YSKL.

   [BELTRAN] MR. PRESIDENT, OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS WE HAVE LEARNED
ABOUT THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VARIOUS
GARRISONS AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  SINCE YOU ARE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
OF THE ARMED FORCES, DO YOU SUPPORT THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PUBLISHED,
WHICH CONDEMNED THE STATEMENTS MADE BY COL. SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ?

   [CRISTIANI] CONCERNING THAT SITUATION, I HAVE SAID THAT SEVERAL
PEOPLE HAVE MADE STATEMENTS, NOT JUST ONE.  THERE HAS BEEN PUBLIC
SPECULATION AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE ASSASSINATIONS OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT.  IF
SOMEONE HAS ANY INFORMATION TO CONTRIBUTE, AND IF THAT SOMEONE IS
REALLY INTERESTED IN THE PROGRESS OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY, HE
SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE TO GIVE HIM THE INFORMATION.  HE SHOULD NOT
CONTINUE TO SPECULATE IN PUBLIC, BECAUSE IT CONFUSES PEOPLE AND IT
OBSTRUCTS THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.

   I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT NOT LONG AGO A
DELEGATION OF SPANISH LEGAL EXPERTS VISITED THE COUNTRY AND THEY WERE
PLEASED TO SEE HOW THE 4TH CRIMINAL JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE JUDICIAL
PROCESS, AS OPPOSED TO OTHER REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE
UNITED STATES.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD SPECULATE IN
PUBLIC AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED.  IF SOMEONE HAS INFORMATION OR
EVIDENCE, HE SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE, OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE
CONFUSION.  IN THAT REGARD, I BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES
COMMANDERS' REJECTION OF COL. OCHOA'S STATEMENTS IS JUST THAT.  IN
MANY OF THE STATEMENTS THEY WROTE -- I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN DRAFTING
THE STATEMENT -- THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT AND
STRENGTHEN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS, BUT THEY CANNOT COME OUT IN PUBLIC
WITH SPECULATION BECAUSE THEY WOULD ONLY CONFUSE PEOPLE.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] HOWEVER, THE FMLN IDEA THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW
FORCE HERE, OR THERE, OR SOMEWHERE IS NOT LOGICAL.  THE IMPORTANT
POINT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN PEACE AND
TRANQUILITY.  THEREFORE, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE THAT THEY MAY HAVE
1,000, 2,000, OR 100.  THAT DOES NOT MATTER.  I THINK THAT, WHETHER
THEY HAVE A HIGH OR A LOW MORALE OR WHATEVER, WITH JUST 100 RADICALS
THEY COULD KILL PEOPLE AND DESTROY SOURCES OF EMPLOYMENT.  IN SUM,
THEY CAUSE PANIC AND TERROR IN SOME HAMLETS.  I BELIEVE THAT HAS TO BE
STOPPED.  IT IS NOT A MATTER OF WHO SHOWS FORCE AND WHO DOES NOT.
REGARDLESS OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF FORCE THE FMLN MAY CARRY OUT, WE
STILL BELIEVE THAT, IN THE LONG RUN, THE MILITARY VICTORY BY THE
GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT IS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A
STRONG MORAL SUPPORT.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE
AND HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE PEOPLE SUPPORT THE
SYSTEM AND THE GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHO IS HEADING IT, NOT JUST A
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.  HOWEVER, THAT IS NOT THE POINT.  WE DO NOT
WANT THIS CONFLICT TO LAST 10 YEARS LONGER, WITH MORE BLOODSHED.
THEREFORE, WE ARE SEARCHING FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION BECAUSE WE
BELIEVE IN IT, NOT BECAUSE IT SUITS US BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONGER OR
NOT STRONGER.

   [MODERATOR] JAMES LOHMAN.

   [LOHMAN] MR. PRESIDENT, WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT'S MILITARY AID, HAS YOUR GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE
POSSIBILITY OF SEEKING MILITARY AID IN OTHER COUNTRIES ON THIS
CONTINENT OR FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD?  FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT
A COUNTRY LIKE ISRAEL HAS GIVEN MILITARY AID TO CENTRAL AMERICAN
COUNTRIES.  HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT POSSIBILITY?

   [CRISTIANI] I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT, YES, CERTAINLY, THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS THE DUTY OF DEFENDING THE SYSTEM AND
THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, AND -- REGARDLESS OF WHAT MAY
HAPPEN, AND WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT OCCUR -- IF THAT HAPPENS, WE WILL
ALWAYS HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATE RESOURCES FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE
COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  A FEW DAYS AGO I LISTENED TO
STATEMENTS BY SOME POLITICIANS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER SECTORS, WHO
COMPLAINED BECAUSE I SAID: WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEFENDING THE
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, WE HAVE TO FIND THE RESOURCES, AND THERE ARE
OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO GET RESOURCES FOR THE NATIONAL DEFENSE.  THOSE
POLITICIANS SAID IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS TO AFFECT SOCIAL PROGRAMS TO
HELP THE NEEDY.  THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT THOSE POLITICIANS SHOULD THINK
ABOUT WHEN THEY ASK FOR A REDUCTION IN AID.  I BELIEVE THAT IS
SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT NEGLECT.  THE GOVERNMENT MUST DEFEND
THE SYSTEM FROM POSSIBLE ATTACKS -- THROUGH VIOLENCE TO REACH POWER --
WHICH HAS BEEN TERMED BY CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MANY
COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS ILLEGAL.

   [LOHMAN] HAVE YOU CONSIDERED [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE ARE TAKING INTO
CONSIDERATION SOME ALTERNATIVES.  HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE
THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS DEFENSELESS.

   [MODERATOR] WE WILL NOW HAVE QUESTIONS IN ENGLISH.  TOM GIBBS FROM
THE BBC.

   [GIBBS] WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT OF CUTTING U.S.  MILITARY AID?  AND ALSO
IT SEEMS THAT THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS PUT AS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE
CONTINUATION OF AID THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] JESUITS' CASE, AND ALSO THE
CLEANING UP OF THE OFFICERS CORPS OF THE ARMY, OR CHANGES IN THE MILITARY.
HOW INCONVENIENT WOULD IT BE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT, OR HOW [WORDS INDISTINCT]
IT WOULD BE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I THINK THAT, FIRST OF ALL, THE EFFECT OF THE REDUCTION
OR CUT OF AID WOULD BE TWOFOLD.  ON THE FIRST HAND, I THINK IT WOULD BE A
NEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE OBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END
TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED, AND THAT
A CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF
THE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT,
THEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY VICTORY IS NOW CLOSER.  AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT
MORE DIFFICULT TO END THE CONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL
DIALOGUE.  SECONDLY, OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO
DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND
WILL NOT STAND BY WITH A WEAKENED DEFENSE.  THEREFORE, THIS MEANS
REALLOCATING RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS --
SOCIAL PROGRAMS, ECONOMIC, OR POLITICAL PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN
HAVE ACCESS TO, AND OBVIOUSLY TO REALLOCATE RESOURCES FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES.
THUS, IT WOULD HAVE A TWOFOLD IMPACT IF THAT WAS THE CASE.

   ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN THE CASE OF
THE JESUIT PRIESTS IS ONGOING.  IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR ME [WORDS
INDISTINCT] TO THINK THAT BEFORE IT HAS ENDED, THAT THERE IS
PREJUDGEMENT ON WHAT THE RESULTS WOULD BE.  I THINK THAT THE JUDGE, AS
I SAID EARLIER, HAS RECEIVED AT LEAST THE VISITS OF MANY PEOPLE.  JUST
RECENTLY A GROUP OF LAWYERS FROM SPAIN CAME IN AND ANALYZED THE CASE,
AND WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE CASE,
ACCORDING, OBVIOUSLY, TO SALVADORAN LAW.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COMMANDER JORGE MELENDEZ
(JONAS), A TOP SALVADORAN GUERRILLA LEADER, ADMITTED ON THURSDAY TO A
CHANGE IN THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD THIS COUNTRY AND SAID THAT THE GEORGE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION NOW "FAVORS" A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION TO
THE WAR.

   MELENDEZ, WHO IS A STAFF MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IN THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF MORAZAN, SAID ON
THE CLANDESTINE STATION RADIO VENCEREMOS THAT THE AMERICANS ARE MAKING
A FOREIGN POLICY CHANGE.

   "JONAS" TALKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE CUT IN U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, SAYING THAT "WE CAN NOW SAY
THAT THIS CHANGE ANNOUNCES THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS POLICY TODAY."

   "JUST AS THEY IMPOSED THE WAR, TODAY THEY ARE ALSO IMPOSING
CONDITIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL
SOLUTION," THE GUERRILLA LEADER SAID.

   A U.S. SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE VOTED FOR A CUT IN THE U.S. MILITARY
ASSISTANCE TO EL SALVADOR AND LINKED ANOTHER CUT IN THE AID TO THE
PROGRESS MADE IN THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS TO END A WAR THAT HAS LASTED
A DECADE AND LEFT 72,000 PEOPLE KILLED.

   TO DEAL WITH THE CUT IN MILITARY AID, THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO
CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE SITUATION WOULD FORCE IT TO MAKE BUDGET CUTS
IN OTHER AREAS, SUCH AS HEALTH AND EDUCATION.

   IN THIS REGARD, "JONAS" SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT WARNINGS ARE AIMED
AT MAINTAINING THE MILITARY STRUGGLE AT THE EXPENSE OF "SEVERELY
PUNISHING THE PEOPLE AND ALL LOWER-CLASS GROUPS."

   HOWEVER, MELENDEZ INSISTED THAT "THE MILITARY POLICY IN EL SALVADOR
IS WEAKENING...AND NEW CONDITIONS ARE BEING OPENED."

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [ARMED
FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE, COPREFA] [TEXT] THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND
EMPHATICALLY REJECTS THE JUNIOR OFFICER'S STATEMENTS, CONSIDERED A
TYPE OF GRAY PROPOGANDA, BECAUSE NO PERSON OR GROUP OF PERSONS HAS
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM.  THE STATEMENTS ARE BIASED IN FAVOR
OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].

   ON 10 JANUARY 1981 A SERIES OF SIMILARLY ANONYMOUS LETTERS AND
STATEMENTS WERE CIRCULATED.  THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE LEARNED THAT
THE LETTERS WERE PART OF A STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED BY FORMER CAPTAIN
FRANCISCO SANDOVAL, ALONG WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN
SUBVERSION.

   IN ADDITION, SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENED IN NOVEMBER 1989, BUT THIS
TIME IT WAS DONE BY A HIGH-RANKING MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF
SALVADORAN WORKERS, WHO CLAIMED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED A COMMUNIQUE FROM
JUNIOR OFFICERS ON A NUMBER OF IRREGULARITIES THAT WERE REPORTEDLY
OCCURRING WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES.

   THE FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS LAUNCHED OFFENSIVES ON BOTH OCCASIONS.
ACCORDING TO THEIR GOALS, THE FINAL TASK WAS TO SEIZE POWER BY FORCE
AND BY ALL MEANS, EVEN IF THEY HAD TO SACRIFICE THE LIVES OF MANY
SALVADORAN CIVILIANS AND SEVERELY DAMAGE HOUSES AND THE COUNTRY'S
ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.

   THE ARMED FORCES ARE AWARE OF THEIR HIGH LEVEL OF PROFESSIONALISM
AND THEIR OWN INSTITUTIONAL ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY AS DEMANDED BY THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC AND REITERATE THAT THEIR MISSION WILL
ALWAYS BE TO DEFEND THE NATION'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TO PROTECT EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S LIFE AND INTERESTS.

   THEREFORE, IT IS USELESS TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THE ARMED FORCES'
MORALE AND TO CONFUSE AND DIVIDE ALL THE MEMBERS COMPRISING THE ARMED
FORCES THROUGH GROUNDLESS COMMUNIQUES WHICH ARE INTENDED TO CREATE
FALSE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC.


DEV-MUC3-1267 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH MNR'S
UNGO BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] I HAVE
ANOTHER QUESTION.  A FEW MOMENTS AGO, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI TERMED THE
MOST RIDICULOUS COMMUNIQUE HE HAD EVER HEARD FROM THE FMLN THE ONE IN
WHICH THEY JUSTIFIED YESTERDAY'S MILITARY ACTIONS.  HE TERMED THEM
PROPAGANDA-ORIENTED.  WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, HOW DO
YOU VIEW THIS?

   [UNGO] IN MY OPINION, THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE HAS ASPECTS THAT ARE
INTERESTING AND OTHERS WHICH I THINK ARE NOT VALID.  THE TIME AND
OPPORTUNITY OF THAT ACTION IS AMBIVALENT.  I THINK IT HAS NEGATIVE
EFFECTS, AS WELL AS POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR THEM.  THERE IS ALWAYS THE
FAMOUS VICIOUS CIRCLE WHEREIN IF THE FMLN CEASES TO ACT MILITARILY, IT
IS BAD FOR THE FMLN BECAUSE IT SHOWS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.  IF IT ACTS
MILITARILY IT IS ALSO BAD, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IT DOES NOT WANT
PEACE.  IN THIS SENSE, I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT HAS EXHIBITED
A SHOW OF FORCE, THAT ITS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN STRICTLY
PROPAGANDA-ORIENTED OR WITH PROPAGANDA OBJECTIVES.  IT DOES NOT CEASE
TO CREATE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS THAT GENERATE A NEGATIVE REACTION ON
THE OTHER'S PART, IF THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN AND TRY TO EASE
CONFRONTATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND SEEK AN AGREEMENT AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE.  I BELIEVE, AS I TOLD PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ON THE TELEPHONE
YESTERDAY WHEN WE SPOKE OF OTHER THINGS BUT TOUCHED ON THIS TOPIC,
THAT I UPHOLD THE GOVERNMENT'S THESIS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS CRITICIZED THE
FACT THAT WHEN NEGATIVE THINGS OCCUR, THEY ARE INVOKED TO SUSPEND A
PROCESS WHICH IN OUR OPINION SHOULD BE CONTINUOUS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS
UPHELD THE CONTINUITY OF THE DIALOGUE.  THE GOVERNMENT CRITICIZED THE
FMLN WHEN ON TWO OCCASIONS IT SUSPENDED THE DIALOGUE DUE TO TERRORIST
ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT OR SECURITY CORPS.  THE DIALOGUE
AND NEGOTIATION PROCESS HAS SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THIS.  I BELIEVE
THAT IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE ITS OWN MEDICINE.  IT
SHOULD MAINTAIN THE CONTINUITY OF THE PROCESS AND NOT USE AS A PRETEXT
THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS TO TRY TO SEEK WAYS OF CONDITIONING OR
PERTURBING A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION, WHICH INVOLVES NOT
ONLY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, BUT THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL
FORCES AS WELL.

   [REPORTER] DR. UNGO, IN THAT SENSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD ANNOUNCED
THROUGH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THAT THE DIALOGUE WOULD BE RESUMED ON 3
MAY.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL'S ENVOY ANNOUNCED THAT IT
WOULD BE THE FIRST PART OF MAY.  DON'T YOU THINK THAT TOO MUCH TIME IS
BEING SPENT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO AGREE ON SUMMIT MEETINGS THAT WILL
PERMIT SECURING AGREEMENTS?

   [UNGO] I HAVE A VERY POSITIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW THE PROCESS IS
DEVELOPING IN THIS FIRST PHASE, JUDGING BY THE CONDUCT ON THE PART OF
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN.  I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A DELAY, BUT I
THINK IT IS A DELAY THAT IMPROVES THE POSSIBILITIES AND CONDITIONS.
APPARENTLY THE TIMES WERE MARKED BY HASTE AND PRECIPITATION FOR THE
FMLN TO PRESENT A PROPOSAL.  ALSO, THERE WAS A VERY SHORT TIME FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO PREPARE ITS RESPONSE AND HOLD A BILATERAL MEETING LATER.
AT THE SAME TIME, IT LEFT A VERY NARROW MARGIN OF INFLUENCE TO THE
POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HIMSELF CONVENED THE POLITICAL PARTIES TO
EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THE SITUATION WAS AND HOW HE VIEWED THE ROLE OF
THE PARTIES.  THE PARTIES HAVE THEIR OWN CONCEPT OF THEIR ROLE AND
HAVE BEEN WORKING ARDUOUSLY AND RESPONSIBLY.  IN TWO WEEKS THEY HELD
FOUR PROLONGED, HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS, TWO PER WEEK.  WE WANT TO DO THE
SAME THING WITH THE FMLN.  I BELIEVE THAT THE PERIOD OF TWO TO THREE
WEEKS TO ONE MONTH, SINCE THE GENEVA AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED, HAS BEEN
POSITIVE.  IF WE HAD HURRIED THINGS UP, PERHAPS THE POSSIBILITY OF
ACHIEVING RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.  WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT ALL
OF THIS GIVES WAY TO SOMEWHAT PESSIMISTIC EVALUATIONS, BECAUSE THE
CONFIDENTIALITY WAS VIOLATED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD
THAT THESE THINGS ARE PART OF A PRIVATE, CONFIDENTIAL AIDE-MEMOIRE
THAT WAS AGREED TO IN GENEVA BETWEEN THE TWO TOP LEADERS OF THE FMLN
AND THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL PEREZ DE
CUELLAR'S REPRESENTATIVE.  [CONTINUED]

   GUATEMALA CITY, 5 MAY 90 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] OFFICIAL SOURCES
HAVE REPORTED THAT A GUATEMALAN CARGO PLANE OWNED BY THE TRASLADOS
COMPANY CRASHED THIS AFTERNOON ON TOP OF SEVERAL HOUSES IN NORTHERN
GUATEMALA CITY, CAUSING AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED.

   CIVIL AERONAUTICS PERSONNEL CONFIRMED TO ACAN - EFE THAT THE THREE
CREW MEMBERS OF THE DC-6 WERE U.S. CITIZENS WHO HAD BEEN HIRED TO FLY
THE PLANE TO MIAMI.

   SOURCES FROM THE MUNICIPAL FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID THE PLANE DESTROYED
12 HOUSES.  THE NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED ARE STILL UNKNOWN.

   ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL REPORTS, THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED SHORTLY
AFTER THE PLANE TOOK OFF FROM THE LA AURORA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, AND
APPARENTLY WAS DUE TO THE LOSS OF AN ENGINE.

   FIRE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN HAROLDO JUAREZ SAID THERE HAVE BEEN
EXPLOSIONS IN THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE GASES THAT HAD
ACCUMULATED FROM THE FUEL SPILLED BY THE PLANE.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 30 APR 90 (EL GRAFICO) -- [TEXT] THE MUTUAL SUPPORT GROUP
(GAM) HAS REPORTED FINDING 25 CLANDESTINE CEMETERIES IN THE COUNTRY'S
WESTERN HIGH PLATEAU AREA, NOTING THAT PROCEEDINGS REQUIRED FOR AN
INVESTIGATION INTO THE CEMETERIES HAVE BEGUN.

   ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP, MOST OF THE
CEMETERIES ARE IN HAMLETS AND COMMUNITIES LOCATED IN THE GUATEMALAN
HIGH PLATEAU, AN AREA THAT SUFFERED A GREAT AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE DURING
THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1979 AND 1982.  THE PRESIDENT SAID: "THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE BURIED IN THESE HIDDEN CEMETERIES WERE RELATIVES OF SOME OF
THE PEOPLE WHO BELONG TO OUR HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION."

   GAM PRESIDENT NINETH DE GARCIA ADDED: "ALL THE CRIMES WERE
COMMITTED BY MEN WHO HIDE IN ANONYMITY AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
KIDNAPPING AND DISAPPEARANCES IN OUR COUNTRY."

   OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, GAM HAS INTENSIFIED ITS SEARCH FOR
CLANDESTINE CEMETERIES AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL: THREE CEMETERIES WERE
FOUND IN EL QUICHE, ONE IN CHIMALTENANGO, ONE IN SACATEPEQUEZ, AND ONE
FOUND IN CHINAUTLA LAST YEAR.

   "OUR ACTIVISTS IN THE GUATEMALAN HIGH PLATEAU AREA HAVE REPORTED
SEVERAL TIMES TO OUR HEADQUARTERS THAT CHUPOL'CIVIL PATROL GUARDS HAVE
KIDNAPPED THEIR RELATIVES, THAT TWO CEMETERIES EXIST IN THAT
COMMUNITY, AND THAT OTHER CEMETERIES ARE LOCATED IN USPANTAN, EL
QUICHE, ZACUALPA, AND THE REST OF THE MUNICIPALITIES IN THIS AREA,"
SHE SAID.

   "THERE ARE MORE THAN 100 CEMETERIES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPORTED
TO THE EL QUICHE 2D PENAL COURT AND PENDING AN INVESTIGATION.
HOWEVER, THIS COURT HAS NOT ISSUED THE REQUIRED EXHUMATION ORDERS FOR
THE INVESTIGATIONS TO CONTINUE; THIS MEANS THAT THEY HAVE DELIBERATELY
SHELVED THE CHARGES WE PRESENTED AT THE COURTHOUSE BECAUSE THEY REFUSE
TO CARRY OUT THE REQUIRED LEGAL PROCEDURES," SAID THE GAM PRESIDENT.

   NINETH DE GARCIA STATED: "THE RELATIVES OF THOSE WHO HAVE
DISAPPEARED, REQUEST THAT THE KIDNAPPERS AND MURDERERS OF OUR
RELATIVES BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND PUNISHED.  IN A MONTH'S TIME, OUR
FOUNDATION WILL HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR SIX YEARS AND, UP TO NOW,
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS REFUSED TO FORM A COMMISSION TO
INVESTIGATE THE CASES OF THE 40,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED."

PERPETRATED BY A SHINING PATH CELL ON 6 MAY.  ACCORDING TO THE POLICE,
THE DYNAMITE CHARGE WAS DETONATED ON THE ROUTE FOLLOWED BY FUJIMORI'S
MOTORCADE IN THE DISTRICT CAPITAL OF SAN JUAN DE LURIGANCHO.

   THE ATTACKERS LEFT FLIERS IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS MEMBERS OF THE

DORA VILCHEZ, A 26-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, WAS INJURED IN THE ATTACK.

   FUJIMORI, WHO WILL CONTEND WITH WRITER MARIO VARGAS LLOSA IN A
RUNOFF ELECTION DURING THE FIRST HALF OF JUNE, WAS ONLY INFORMED OF
THE ATTACK BY HIS AIDES AFTER THE POLICE HAD TIGHTENED THEIR SECURITY
AROUND HIM.  THE "CHANGE 90" LEADER MINIMIZED THE ATTACK AND CONTINUED
HIS SCHEDULED ACTIVITIES.

   THE POLICE SAID THAT A SHINING PATH GROUP MANAGED TO INFILTRATE A
CROWD OF DEMONSTRATORS AND SET OFF THE DYNAMITE CHARGE ON THE ROUTE
FOLLOWED BY FUJIMORI'S MOTORCADE, NEAR A LOCAL MARKET, ON THE EASTERN
SIDE OF LIMA.

   VILCHEZ, WHO WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED, WAS HOSPITALIZED.

   THE BOMB SQUAD UNIT (UDE) DEFUSED ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE DEVICE NEAR THE
MARKET.

   THE FLIERS DISSEMINATED BY THE TERRORISTS URGED THE PEOPLE NOT TO
VOTE IN THE RUNOFF ELECTION.  ONE OF THE FLIERS SAID: "NEITHER
FUJIMORI NOR VARGAS LLOSA IS THE SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY BOTH REPRESENT
THE RIGHT WING.  LONG LIVE THE ARMED STRUGGLE.  PCP.SL."

GUERRILLAS WARNED TODAY THAT THE POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF GENERAL
HUMBERTO LARIOS BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CURRENT CHIEF OF STAFF
OF THE ARMED FORCES, "WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS"
WITH THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH WILL BE RESUMED THIS COMING 16 MAY IN
VENEZUELA.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) RELEASED A
COMMUNIQUE HERE TODAY ON THE CHANGE IN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY
LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE RETIREMENT OF DEPUTY DEFENSE
MINISTER COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA.

   "THESE CHANGES WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE CONCERTED CEASE-FIRE
PROCESS, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT REACH AGREEMENTS BASED ON DEMOCRATIZATION
WHILE IMPUNITY PREVAILS IN THE ARMY AND IT IS NOT SUBJECTED TO A
THOROUGH PURGE," THE FMLN ADDED.

   GEN LARIOS TOLD NEWSMEN YESTERDAY ABOUT HIS POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT BY
COL EMILIO PONCE IN THE DEFENSE MINISTRY IS A CHANGE WHICH HE REGARDED
AS "NATURAL."

   "EVENTUALLY THERE MAY BE A CHANGE OF THAT SORT.  IT IS A NATURAL
AND ROUTINE CHANGE," THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID WHEN ASKED ABOUT
PERSISTENT RUMORS TO THIS EFFECT IN THAT PAST FEW DAYS IN EL SALVADOR.

   COL PONCE, A MEMBER OF THE 1966 GRADUATION CLASS KNOWN AS "LA
TANDONA," CURRENTLY HAS GREAT INFLUENCE AMONG THE ARMED FORCES
OFFICERS. HE HAS HELD THE POST OF CHIEF OF STAFF SINCE THE MIDDLE OF
LAST YEAR.

   THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE STATED THAT PONCE'S REMOVAL FROM THE POST OF
CHIEF OF STATE "WOULD BREAK THE CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HIGH
COMMAND IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS."  THE JESUIT
PRIESTS WERE ASSASSINATED ON 16 NOVEMBER BY ALLEGED ARMED FORCES
MEMBERS, WHO WERE TURNED OVER TO JUDICIARY AUTHORITIES.

INSPIRATION TO EVERY SALVADORAN SOLDIER WHO IS FIGHTING FOR OUR
PEOPLE'S FREEDOM AND GLORY.  AS OF TODAY, THE SPECIAL ANTI- TERRORIST

ECUADORAN FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER CORDOVEZ, MADAME CORDOVEZ, AND FOUR
OTHER ECUADORAN OFFICIALS ARRIVED IN LLASA ON THE MORNING OF 5 MAY.

   AT 1830 THE SAME DAY, PUQUANG, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE TIBET
AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT, MET WITH THE ECUADORAN
VISITORS AT THE TIBETAN-STYLE MEETING ROOM AT THE HOLIDAY INN IN
LHASA.  IN A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE, VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG BRIEFED
FOREIGN MINISTER CORDOVEZ ON TIBET'S AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY,
INDUSTRY, ENERGY, AND COMMUNICATIONS; AND ESPECIALLY THE SUCCESSES
TIBET HAS ACHIEVED IN VARIOUS FIELDS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
CENTRAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT SINCE TIBET'S DEMOCRATIC REFORM.

   ON BEHALF OF THE TIBETAN AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT,
VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG PRESENTED GIFTS TO THE VISITORS.  THEN, VICE
CHAIRMAN PUQUANG HOSTED A DINNER IN HONOR OF THE ECUADORAN VISITORS.

   MAKING HIS WELCOMING SPEECH, VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG SAID: YOUR
EXCELLENCY MINISTER CORDOVEZ HAS VISITED CHINA MANY TIMES AND YOU HAVE
CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRIENDLY RELATIONS
BETWEEN CHINA AND ECUADOR AND THE PEOPLES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES.  YOUR
EXCELLENCY'S CURRENT VISIT TO TIBET WILL CERTAINLY ENABLE YOU TO
UNDERSTAND CHINA BETTER.

   VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG STRESSED: TIBET HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHINA'S
SACRED TERRITORY SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE 13TH CENTURY.  IT IS A FACT
ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE WHOLE WORLD THAT ALL PREVIOUS CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS
EFFECTIVELY EXERCISED THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IN TIBET.

   VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG ALSO SAID THAT, SINCE THE LIFTING THE MARTIAL
LAW ORDER IN LHASA, TIBET'S SITUATION HAS BEEN STABLE, ITS PUBLIC

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [REPORT] [JULIO
ERNESTO RODRIGUEZ] [TEXT] DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO
LARIOS STATED TODAY THAT THE OFFICERS WHO COULD SERVE AS WITNESSES IN
THE CASE OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS ASSASSINATED AT THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY ARE TAKING TRAINING COURSES ABROAD.  HE DENIED THE
OFFICERS LEFT FOR REASONS OTHER FOR THE STRICTLY MILITARY NEED OF
TRAINING.  IF THE JUDGE SO ASKS FOR IT, THEY MAY RETURN TO GIVE THEIR
STATEMENT ON THE JESUITS' CASE, HE SAID.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE LOSS OF
THE REGISTRY RECORDING THE ENTRY AND DEPARTURE OF PERSONS FROM THE
MILITARY ACADEMY, GEN. LARIOS SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LARIOS] THE CADETS ARE NOW OUT OF THE COUNTRY.  THIS
IS IN LINE WITH A PROGRAM PLANNED WELL IN ADVANCE.  CADETS OF CERTAIN CLASSES
LEAVE TO CONDUCT STUDIES, CHIEFLY IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS IS NORMAL, AS
IT CORRESPONDS TO A SCHEDULED PLAN.  THEY WILL HAVE TO RETURN AT SOME POINT
WHEN THEY CONCLUDE THEIR STUDIES IN THE UNITED STATES.  THEN WE WILL HAVE
THE TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY ANY ASPECT OF THIS MATTER.

   [REPORTER] COULD NOT THE JUDGE CALL THEM EARLIER?

   [LARIOS] IF THE JUDGE DEEMS THEIR PRESENCE ADVISABLE, THEY MAY BE
CALLED IMMEDIATELY.

   [REPORTER] REFERRING TO THE ENTRY AND DEPARTURE REGISTRY OF THE
DAY WHEN THE JESUITS WERE KILLED, HOW WILL THIS SITUATION END UP?

   [LARIOS] SO FAR, I CANNOT COMMENT ON THE MATTER.  I AM NOT AWARE
OF THE SITUATION.  WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. [END RECORDING]

   GEN. LARIOS FEELS THAT THE JESUITS' CASE HAS HAD A GREAT BEARING ON
THE CONDITIONS PLACED ON THE MILITARY AID THE U.S. SENATE WILL
APPROVE.  THE MILITARY CHIEF REGRETTED IT IS NOT UP TO THE SALVADORAN
ARMY TO SAY WHEN THE AID MUST BE CUT.  THE U.S. LAWMAKERS HAVE THEIR
MEANS AND CRITERIA TO DECIDE WHEN TO CUT AID, HE SAID REFERRING TO THE
DECISION BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  THE U.S.  ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID IT
WILL CUT MILITARY AID BY 50 PERCENT IF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DOES
NOT TRY THE PERSONS GUILTY OF MURDERING SIX JESUITS AND TWO OTHERS.
THE AID WILL BE CUT IF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT TRY TO OBTAIN
SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GUERRILLAS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LARIOS] WE ALL KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN REGARDING THE
MILITARY AID.  UNFORTUNATELY, WE MUST ADMIT WE CANNOT DECIDE THE TERMS UNDER
WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE THAT MILITARY AID.  THEY MUST DO THAT.  THEY WILL
DECIDE WHEN AND BY HOW MUCH THAT AID WILL BE CUT.

   [REPORTER] GENERAL, DO YOU THINK THAT THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM IN
WHICH COL.OCHOA PEREZ PARTICIPATED WAS INFLUENTIAL IN THE DECISION TO
ASK THE THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO CUT THE AID?

   [LARIOS] I THINK THAT IT HAS DEFINITELY BEEN INFLUENTIAL.  WE MUST
UNDOUBTEDLY RECOGNIZE THIS.  NEVERTHELESS, THAT IS NOT ALL.  I BELIEVE
THAT THE SITUATION EXISTED EVEN BEFORE THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM WAS
BROADCAST.  THEREFORE, I BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM EXISTED REGARDLESS
OF WHAT WAS SAID DURING THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM, AND WE WERE [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WHAT WERE THE ISSUES WHICH HAD ALREADY DETERMINED THIS?
WHAT COULD THEY BE?

   [LARIOS] THAT IS REALLY NOTHING NEW.  THE JESUITS' CASE HAS BEEN,
LET US SAY, THE DECISIVE FACTOR FOR DECIDING ONE THING OR ANOTHER IN
THE U.S. CONGRESS, SENATE, AND ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE MILITARY AID.
THAT IS BASICALLY THE ISSUE. [END RECORDING]

   GEN. LARIOS ALSO TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLE CHANGES WHICH MIGHT OCCUR IN
THE ARMY LEADERSHIP.  RECENT RUMORS INDICATE THAT HE MIGHT LEAVE HIS
POST AS DEFENSE MINISTER, AND THAT CHANGES MIGHT OCCUR WITHIN THE
ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND.  HE SAID THAT HE DOES NOT RULE OUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THESE CHANGES MAY OCCUR, BUT HE TERMED THEM AS
ROUTINE.

   REFERRING TO A U.S. TELEVISION PROGRAM WHICH IMPLIED COLONEL
ORLANDO ZEPEDA'S PARTICIPATION IN THE JESUITS' CASE, THE DEFENSE
MINISTER SAID HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION BECAUSE THE
DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER IS A COLLEAGUE WHO ONLY HANDLES ADMINISTRATIVE
ISSUES WITHIN THE ARMY.

QUESTIONING OF POLICEMEN INVOLVED IN THE LOCAL COCAINE TRADE, BRAZILIAN
POLICE AGENTS SEIZED A LAB IN WESTERN MATO GROSSO DO SUL STATE IN EARLY
APRIL.  IN ADDITION, BROADCASTS AIRED IN THE STATE CAPITAL OF CORUMBA
DENOUNCING THE DRUG PROBLEM AND POLICE INVOLVEMENT HAVE MADE A LOCAL RADIO
STATION A TARGET OF BOMB THREATS FROM NARCOTRAFFICKERS, ACCORDING TO REPORTS
IN THE BRAZILIAN PRESS.  SUBSEQUENTLY, PRESIDENT FERNANDO COLLOR DE MELLO

ARMED TRAFFICKERS WERE ARRESTED.  WITH INADEQUATE POLICE STRENGTH AND
BORDERING BOTH BOLIVIA AND PARAGUAY, THE STATE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF
THE MAIN ROUTES FOR THE DRUG RINGS THAT SUPPLY COCAINE TO BRAZIL'S
PRINCIPAL URBAN CENTERS, PARTICULARLY RIO AND SAO PAULO.  THE
TRAFFICKERS ALSO HAVE CONNECTIONS ABROAD.

   THE LABORATORY IN AQUIDAUANA WAS DISCOVERED AS A RESULT OF THE
RECENT ARREST OF EIGHT CIVILIAN POLICE DETECTIVES, TWO FEDERAL
POLICEMEN, AND FOUR HIGHWAY POLICEMEN INVOLVED IN A NARCOTICS RING,
CONTINUES O GLOBO.  DURING QUESTIONING, THEY PROVIDED INFORMATION THAT
LED TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE RING, INCLUDING A BOLIVIAN CHEMIST IN
AQUIDAUANA.  THE RING WAS HEADED BY A MATO GROSSO DO SUL BUSINESSMAN
AND A POLITICIAN WHO FINANCED THE TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES AND PROVIDED
COVER; NEITHER MAN WAS IDENTIFIED BY NAME IN THE REPORT.  ACCORDING TO
FEDERAL AGENTS, THE COCAINE PASTE WAS BROUGHT FROM BOLIVIA BY
FISHERMEN AND CANOERS HIRED ON THE BRAZILIAN- BOLIVIAN BORDER, AND WAS
PROCESSED AND DISTRIBUTED IN AQUIDAUANA.

   O GLOBO TERMS THE RAID A "REAL CLEAN-UP" IN THE CIVILIAN, MILITARY,

THAT THE RING INCLUDED MORE THAN 20 MILITARY POLICEMEN.  THE
RINGLEADER WAS OLDINEY FREIRE, AN ATTORNEY ARRESTED IN MARCH 1989 AND
A CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF RANCHER CAMBARALAMAIA DE SOUSA.  PRIOR TO HIS
ARREST IN JUNE 1988, CAMBARALAMAIA CONTROLLED COCAINE TRAFFICKING IN A
LARGE PORTION OF MATO GROSSO USING THE COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA ROUTE.  HE
ALSO SUPPLIED 300 KILOS OF PURE COCAINE MONTHLY TO SAO PAULO, RIO DE
JANEIRO, AND ESPIRITO SANTO.

   RIO DE JANEIRO DAILY JORNAL DO BRASIL NOTES ON 17 APRIL THAT THE
FEDERAL POLICE DEPARTMENT (DPF) IS INVESTIGATING CHARGES THAT FEDERAL
POLICE ARE INVOLVED IN DRUG SMUGGLING AND TRAFFICKING IN CORUMBA AND
LADARIO.  TRAFFICKING IN THE REGION HAS INCREASED STEADILY IN RECENT
YEARS DUE TO THE PROXIMITY TO BOLIVIAN TOWNS INCLUDED IN THE ROUTE
USED BY INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKING RINGS, ACCORDING TO THE PAPER.
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE FEDERAL
POLICE IN MATO GROSSO DO SUL, DPF LEGAL COORDINATOR MARIO CASSIANO
DUTRA SAID THAT IN FEBRUARY ALONE, FOUR INVESTIGATIONS WERE OPENED
INTO CHARGES OF POLICE INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG AND ARMS TRAFFICKING AND
BRIBERY, AN ADDITIONAL 12 WERE CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS, AND ANOTHER FIVE
ONLY NEEDED DOCUMENTS IN ORDER TO BE CONCLUDED.

DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE REGISTRATION OF FIVE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES FOR THE UPCOMING 27 MAY ELECTIONS.

   THE MEASURE ESPECIALLY AFFECTS ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, CANDIDATE OF
THE FORMER 19 APRIL (M-19) GUERRILLA MOVEMENT, WHO REPLACED CARLOS
PIZARRO LEON-GOMEZ, WHO WAS ASSASSINATED LAST MONTH WHILE HE WAS
ABOARD A FLIGHT, AS M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

   THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH HAS PRONOUNCED ITSELF ON THE DECREES AND
LAWS PROMULGATED BY THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES, DECLARED
UNCONSTITUTIONAL A DECREE ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT
VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS WHICH ELIMINATED THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR PERSONS
TO REGISTER AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDDIDATES. THE DECREE WAS ISSUED UNDER
THE STATE OF SIEGE THAT HAS EXISTED FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS.

   THE GOVERNMENT DECREE WAS ISSUED TO FAVOR PIZARRO LEON-GOMEZ, WHO
ENTERED THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AFTER A PEACE PROCESS WHEREBY THE M-19
DEMOBILIZED AND ABANDONED THE ARMED STRUGGLE.

   ALSO AFFECTED ARE CANDIDATES GUILLERMO ALEMAN, POPULAR SINGER AND
CUMBIA COMPOSER MARIO GARENA, JAIRO RODRIGUEZ LEON, AND HENRY FARFAN
SILVA, WHO HAD ALREADY RESIGNED, ALTHOUGH NONE OF THEM HAD ANY CHANCE
OF WINNING.

   ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT, THE STATE OF SIEGE MUST ONLY BE
CONSIDERED WHEN ISSUING DECREES DEALING WITH THE RESTORING OF PUBLIC
ORDER, WHICH DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   THE COLOMBIAN LAWS DEMAND THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST BE OR
HAS BEEN A PARLIAMENTARIAN, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, AMBASSADOR, OR
ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND HAS BEEN A PROFESSIONAL FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS.

   NONETHELESS, THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IS NOT RETROACTIVE AND
THE CANDIDACIES WILL BE WITHDRAWN ONLY IF THEY ARE OFFICIALLY
CHALLENGED.

HAVE DULY ACKNOWLEDGED NOTE DPG 1794 OF 30 APRIL 1990 FROM THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, THROUGH WHICH THIS EMBASSY HAS BEEN
INFORMED THAT OUR REFUGEE GONZALO GONZALEZ RIVERA IS ACCUSED OF BEING
THE MASTERMIND OF CHILD MARCOS ALBERTO RODRIGUEZ JUSTINES' MURDER
ACCORDING TO CANCIO CIACCI TASON'S STATEMENTS.

   IN THIS REGARD, THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY REITERATES THAT, THROUGH NOTE
NO.5-20-M/002 DATED 8 JANUARY 1990, IT NOTIFIED THE PANAMANIAN FOREIGN

CAME TO THIS MISSION'S RESIDENCE, INCLUDING FORMER DEFENSE FORCES
MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ RIVERA, AND REQUESTED THAT SAFE-CONDUCTS BE
GRANTED FOR THEM TO TRAVEL ABROAD.  WE MIGHT STRESS THAT SUCH GRANTING
OF ASYLUM AND REQUESTING SAFE-CONDUCTS, AS WAS INDICATED IN THIS
EMBASSY'S NOTE NO.5-20-/M-027 DATED 2 MARCH 1990, WAS BASED ON THE
QUALIFICATION GRANTED TO THIS EMBASSY AS THE STATE GRANTING THE ASYLUM
ACCORDING TO THE CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM SIGNED IN CARACAS IN
MARCH 1954.  THEREFORE, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION ANY ACTIONS OF WHICH THE REFUGEE MAY BE ACCUSED, OR ANY
LEGAL SITUATION THAT MAY PREVAIL AFTER THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN GRANTED
ASYLUM.

   HOWEVER, AND WITHOUT GOING AGAINST WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY STATED,
THE REFUGEE GONZALO GONZALEZ IS WILLING TO RENDER TESTIMONY BEFORE AN
AUTHORIZED LEGAL OFFICIAL SO AS TO CLARIFY HIS SITUATION.  THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY WILL ALLOW THAT OFFICIAL TO ENTER THE PREMISES OF THE
EMBASSY FOR THIS PURPOSE.

   AT THIS TIME, THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY, BASED ON THE CLEAR DISPOSITIONS
OF THE CARACAS CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM -- THE INTERNATIONAL
AGREEMENT IN EFFECT BETWEEN PANAMA AND PERU -- REITERATES ONCE AGAIN
THE REQUEST FOR A SAFE-CONDUCT FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED REFUGEE.

MAY 13, CANA -- BRITISH LAWYER LOUIS BLOM COOPER WAS PREPARING TO HEAD BACK
TO LONDON SUNDAY AFTER DISCUSSIONS HERE ON A JUDICIAL INQUIRY INTO A 1989
ARMS SHIPMENT THROUGH ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA. THE QUEEN'S COUNSEL [QC] ARRIVED
HERE FOR TALKS WITH GOVERNOR GENERAL SIR WILFRED JACOBS AND ATTORNEY GENERAL
FORDE ON THE ILLEGAL ARMS SHIPMENT THAT ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF COLOMBIAN
DRUG DEALERS. THE PROBE, SAID CANARADIO, WILL BEGIN IN TWO MONTHS.

   IN IDENTIFYING THE BRITON TO HEAD THE INVESTIGATION, THE CABINET
HERE DESCRIBED HIM AS A RESPECTED JURIST WITH EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING
COMMISSIONS OF ENQUIRY. BLOM COOPER CONDUCTED A COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY
INTO ARSON, CORRUPTION, AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS IN THE TURKS AND
CAICOS ISLANDS IN 1986.

   ISRAEL SAYS IT SOLD THE ARMS TO THE ANTIGUA GOVERNMENT, BUT ST.
JOHN'S DENIES THIS. THE ISRAELIS HAVE IMPLICATED AN ANTIGUAN MINISTER,
VERE BIRD JR. IN THE SCANDAL, BUT BIRD SAYS HE HAD NO LINKS WITH THE
ARMS.

   MEANWHILE, ISRAEL ON SUNDAY CALLED COLOMBIAN DIPLOMATIC SANCTIONS
OVER THE SALES OF ISRAELI ARMS TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS UNJUSTIFIED AND
SAID IT WAS WORKING TO END THE ROW. AFTER COLOMBIAN POLICE FOUND
HUNDREDS OF ISRAELI-MADE GUNS ON THE FARM OF A DEAD DRUG BARON, BOGOTA
SAID ON FRIDAY IT WAS REVOKING 1962 AND 1966 AGREEMENTS ALLOWING
ISRAELIS TO VISIT WITHOUT VISAS.

   "WE REGRET THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DECISION, WHICH WE THINK IS
NEITHER RIGHT NOR JUSTIFIED. WE WILL REMAIN IN CONTACT WITH THE
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE," AN ISRAELI
FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN TOLD REUTERS.

   BOGOTA HAS ALSO ACCUSED ISRAELI AND BRITISH MERCENARIES OF HELPING
DRUG TRAFFICKERS TRAIN PRIVATE ARMIES BLAMED FOR KILLING CIVILIANS IN
NORTHERN COLOMBIA.

   ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA'S FINANCE MINISTER JOHN ST. LUCE HAS MET WITH
AND APPRISED THE HEADS OF THE COUNTRY'S TEN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OF
GOVERNMENT'S PROGRESS IN SETTING UP THE JUDICIAL ENQUIRY, A STATEMENT
FROM THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE SAID.

   "I'M AWARE THAT ALL BANK MANAGERS NEED TO KEEP THEIR HEAD OFFICES
AND, OR DIRECTORS ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS," ST. LUCE WAS QUOTED AS
SAYING.

   THE MINISTER ASKED THE BANKS TO "BE OBJECTIVE AND ALLOW THE
JUDICIAL INQUIRY TO DETERMINE WHAT REALLY TRANSPIRED AND TO INFORM THE
COUNTRY AS TO WHO ARE THE PERSONS INVOLVED." THE STATEMENT SAID THE
BANK MANAGERS "EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR MR. ST.  LUCE'S FRANKNESS
AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DISCUSSION."

GALARZA, AUTHORS OF THE BOOKS PLANNED CRIME AND WHO KILLED ROLDOS, ARE
SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY ON TUESDAY, 15 MAY, BEFORE THE CONGRESS' MULTIPARTY
COMMISSION THAT IS INVESTIGATING THE DEATH OF FORMER PRESIDENT JAIME ROLDOS
AGUILERA.

   ERNESTO BUENANO SAID THAT IN TOMORROW'S MEETING HE WILL REVEAL THE
NAMES OF THOSE INVOLVED IN JAIME ROLDOS AGUILERA'S DEATH, AND HE WILL
PRESENT THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS.  HE ALSO REQUESTED THAT THE
COMMISSION MEETING BE HELD IN PUBLIC.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUENANO] WE WANT TO THANK REPORTERS LIKE YOU
BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING FOR EIGHT YEARS.  WE HAVE DEDICATED
EIGHT YEARS TO INVESTIGATING PRESIDENT ROLDOS' ACCIDENT, AND IT WAS
NOT UNTIL TODAY THAT WE WERE SUMMONED TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE MULTIPARTY
COMMISSION.

   THIS STRUGGLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] IS NOTHING BUT THE RESULTS OF THE
EFFORTS EXERTED MY MANY REPORTERS LIKE YOU, WHO HAVE HELPED US SO
SELFLESSLY AND WHO HAVE NOT TRIED TO WITHHOLD THE INFORMATION.  I
BELIEVE THAT THIS DESERVES PRAISE AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THIS.

   IN REGARD TO WHAT WE WILL SAY TOMORROW, WE WILL PROVE TO THE
COUNTRY THAT THE SO-CALLED HUMAN FAILURE [WHICH REPORTEDLY CAUSED THE
ACCIDENT] IS A LIE.  SECOND, WE WILL PROVE HOW THE CIA ACTS ON THE
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL; WHO ITS AGENTS ARE IN ECUADOR AND THEIR NAMES;
AND WHAT CAUSED THE PRESIDENTIAL PLANE CRASH, WHICH WE HAVE TERMED A
HOMICIDE.  WE WILL TELL THE COUNTRY WHO THE MAIN POLITICAL CONSPIRATOR
WAS AGAINST PRESIDENT ROLDOS.  WE WILL PROVE THIS WITH DOCUMENTS
BECAUSE WE WILL NOT BE TALKING ABOUT [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE WILL
REVEAL WHAT THIS POLITICAL CONSPIRATOR SAID BEFORE THE PRESIDENT'S
DEATH AND AFTER HIS ASSASSINATION. [END RECORDING]

   SANTIAGO, 15 MAY 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] AT LEAST SIX [AS HEARD]
BOMBS EXPLODED IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CAPITAL DURING THE NIGHT. ONE
INDIVIDUAL WAS INJURED. THE DAMAGES WERE DIFFERENT IN EACH CASE.

   ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS INCIDENTS OCCURRED IN THE AREA OF THE U.S.
CONSULATE, IN FRONT OF FORESTAL PARK AND THE PURISIMA BRIDGE.  HERE,
UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS THREW A BOMB ONTO THE DIPLOMATIC PREMISES,
INJURING A GUARD NAMED BARROSO, WHO WAS TAKEN TO THE CENTRAL HOSPITAL.

   THE SERIES OF BOMBINGS BEGAN WHEN AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS
THREW A BOMB INTO THE DEFENSE MINISTRY'S PARKING LOT, LOCATED OFF AN
ALLEY BETWEEN ALAMEDA AND ALONSO VALLE STREETS. TWO CARS WERE
DAMAGED BUT NO ONE WAS INJURED.  OTHER BOMBS EXPLODED ON BANDERA AND
ALAMEDA STREETS, AND NEAR AN AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT FIRM
ON TARAPACA AND SANTA ROSA STREETS. ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED ON THAT
CORNER A FEW WEEKS AGO.

   THE OTHER BOMBS DAMAGED AN ISRAELI COMMUNITY OFFICE AT SERRANO AND
TARAPACA STREETS, A FRUIT EXPORTING FIRM AT ELIODORO YANEZ AND GENERAL
SALVO STREETS IN PROVIDENCIA, AND A MORMON CHURCH AT PEDRO DE VALDIVIA
AND OCURO STREETS.

   LIMA, 14 MAY 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PERUVIAN POLICE, AND PARTS OF
THE ARMY, HAVE RECEIVED ORDERS OF "STRICT CONFINEMENT TO BARRACKS" IN
VIEW OF THE 17 MAY ANNIVERSARY OF THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION SHINING
PATH.  THE ORGANIZATION HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL CELEBRATE ITS 10TH
ANNIVERSARY WITH AN INCREASE IN ARMED OPERATIONS.

   PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE GROUP THAT REBELLED
ON 17 MAY 1980 HAS DEVISED "A CELEBRATIONS PLAN" AND THAT IT INTENDS
TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN AS "A SIGN OF VICTORY" IN THE "STRUGGLE OF
MOVEMENTS," AN IDEOLOGY INSPIRED IN MAO ZEDONG'S DOCTRINE.

   ARMY PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO BARRACKS SINCE THE NIGHT OF 12
MAY AND HAVE ALREADY PARTICIPATED ON JOINT OPERATIONS WITH THE POLICE
TO ARREST 500 ALLEGED TERRORISTS.

   IN LIMA, 8,000 POLICE AGENTS AND A SPECIAL ANTIEXPLOSIVES SQUAD
LAUNCHED "A GIGANTIC OPERATION" OF "BLOCKADES AND SATURATION."

   A POLICE SPOKESMAN TOLD EFE THAT THEY HAD ORDERS "TO CAREFULLY COMB
THE NEW URBAN AREAS AND SEARCH FOR SUSPECTED CRIMINALS, ARMS,
EXPLOSIVES, OR SUBVERSIVE MATERIAL."

   ACCORDING TO THE SPOKESMAN, THE LIMA POLICE DEPARTMENT HEADED BY
GENERAL OSVALDO DIAZ HAS ORDERS "TO WATCH ROADS ENTERING THE CITY, TO
INSTALL EMERGENCY CHECK POINTS IN STRATEGIC LOCATIONS, AND TO REPORT
ON ANYTHING UNUSUAL."

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, THE OPERATION WILL CONTINUE UNTIL
AFTER THE RUNOFF ELECTION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE HELD ON 10 JUNE.

   THE POLICE HAVE LAUNCHED SIMILAR OPERATIONS IN REGIONS WHERE
GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS RAMPANT SUCH AS AYACUCHO, PUNO, HUANCAYO, AND
HUANCAVELICA IN THE PERUVIAN CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  THESE REGIONS ARE ALL
UNDER STATES OF EMERGENCY AND UNDER MILITARY CONTROL.

   SHINING PATH, CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST IMPENETRABLE AND ORTHODOX
ARMED MOVEMENTS IN LATIN AMERICA, BEGAN CELEBRATING ITS ANNIVERSARY IN
LIMA LAST WEEK BY BURNING 11 STATE TRANSPORT COMPANY BUSES. THE BUSES
WERE ATTACKED BY HOODED INDIVIDUALS THOUGHT TO BE SHINING PATH
MILITANTS.

   ON 11 MAY A BOMB DESTROYED A BUILDING OWNED BY THE FAMILY OF THE
MAYOR OF LIMA.  IN ANOTHER INCIDENT IN LIMA TODAY, POLICE CORPORAL
OSWALDO PALOMINO, WHO SERVED IN AYACUCHO UNTIL A SHORT TIME AGO, WAS
SHOT TO DEATH.

   IN AYACUCHO, WHERE THE THE COMUNIST PARTY OF PERU -- "OFFICIAL"
NAME OF SHINING PATH -- WAS BORN AND DEVELOPED, TWO PEOPLE WERE
MURDERED, AND VARIOUS HOME-MADE BOMBS EXPLODED IN IN THE LAST 24
HOURS.

   COUNCILMEN JUAN MANUEL GARABITO FROM PIURA, 1,100 KM NORTH OF LIMA,
HAS ALSO BEEN SHOT TO DEATH. AUTHORITIES BLAMED SHINING PATH FOR THESE
ATTACKS.

   OBSERVERS OF THE PERUVIAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TOLD EFE THAT THE
GROWING TIDE OF VIOLENCE ATTIBUTED TO SHINING PATH INDICATES THAT THE
RADICAL, OR "RED" SECTOR, OF THE REBEL GROUP HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF THE
ORGANIZATION.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES, TWO DIFFERENT FACTIONS WITHIN THE
ORGANIZATION CLASHED OVER THE CELEBRATION OF THE GROUP'S ANNIVERSARY:
THE YOUNGER AND RADICAL SECTORS FAVORED PURELY MILITARY OPERATIONS
WHILE THE OLDER SECTOR, OR "BLACKS," FAVORED MORE POLITICAL AND
HISTORIC ACTIVITIES.

   SHINING PATH, WHICH OFFICIALLY OPERATES WITH APPROXIMATELY 5,000
ARMED MEN, HAS CAUSED THE DEATH OF 20,000 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 7,000
CIVILIANS, AND IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR $17 BILLION IN DIRECT DAMAGES TO
THE COUNTRY OVER ITS 10 YEAR HISTORY.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 16 MAY 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] GOVERNMENT SOURCES
ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THREE POLICEMEN FROM THE GUATEMALA POLICE
IDENTIFICATION DEPARTMENT WERE KILLED BY GUERRILLAS OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   POLICE SPOKESMEN SAID THAT POLICEMEN HUMBERTO DIAZ, A DRIVER; EDGAR
CORONADO, A PHOTOGRAPHER; AND MARIO NAVARRO, A TECHNICAL SERGEANT,
WERE AMBUSHED LAST NIGHT BY GUERRILLAS AT THE SAN ISIDRO FARM, 99 KM
SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL.

   THE POLICEMEN WERE ON THE WAY BACK FROM INVESTIGATING THE BURNING
OF FIVE BUSES BY REBELS LAST WEEK AND WERE PRESUMABLY KILLED BY
GUERRILLAS FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS
(ORPA).

   MEANWHILE, AMALIO ESCOBAR MONZON, 21, A MEMBER OF THE CIVIL SELF-DEFENSE
PATROLS (PAC), WAS SHOT TO DEATH IN SAN PABLO, SAN MARCOS DEPARTMENT, IN THE
NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.

   OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THAT YESTERDAY ARMED MEN BROKE INTO MONZON'S
RESIDENCE AND KILLED HIM.

   IN SOLOLA DEPARTMENT, ALSO IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY,
OTHER INSURGENT GROUPS OCCUPIED STRETCHES OF HIGHWAY AND DEMANDED THAT
TRAVELERS SURRENDER THEIR MONEY AND BELONGINGS.

   THESE INSURGENT ACTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE
THE DIALOGUE THAT WILL BE HELD IN SPAIN BETWEEN GUERRILLA DELEGATES
AND THE GUATEMALAN POLITICAL PARTIES TO AGREE ON A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE
AND TO END 30 YEARS OF INTERNAL STRIFE.

   THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG), WHICH INCLUDES
THE ORPA AND OTHER INSURGENT MOVEMENTS, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS BUT IN THE MEANTIME WILL CONTINUE ITS ARMED
STRUGGLE.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 16 MAY 90 (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] TERRORIST
ACTIONS WERE REPORTED TONIGHT SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, A FEW HOURS AFTER A
MASS TRANSIT BUS AND SEVERAL TIRES WERE BURNED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY.
TWO EXPLOSIONS TOOK PLACE IN A VACANT LOT AT APPROXIMATELY 2120 ON 15TH
AVENUE AND 6TH STREET, ZONE 13.  ACCORDING TO PERSONS WHO WERE NEARBY AT
THAT TIME, SHOOTING WAS HEARD BEFORE THE EXPLOSIONS. A FEW MINUTES LATER,
DEVICES, BELIEVED TO BE FRAGMENTATION GRENADES, WENT OFF.  THE SHOCK WAVE
CREATED BY THE BLAST SHATTERED THE WINDOWS OF HOUSE NUMBER 729 AND BUILDING
626, LOCATED IN FRONT OF THE VACANT LOT.  THE EXPLOSION PROMPTED THE QUICK
MOBILIZATION OF FIREMEN, POLICEMEN, AND SEVERAL ARMY ARMORED PERSONNEL
CARRIERS FROM LA AURORA MILITARY BASE.

   SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL ORANGE EXPLOSIVE SQUAD [UNIDAD
NARANJA ESPECIAL DE LUCHA ANTIEXPLOSIVOS] ALSO ARRIVED TO DEFUSE
ANOTHER DEVICE LEFT IN THE AREA.  AT FIRST, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE
HOME CLOSE TO THE SITE OF THE EXPLOSION BELONGEDTO NEWSMAN ALVARO
CONTRERAS VELEZ.  WE WERE NOT ABLE TO VERIFY THIS REPORT.  WE JUST
LEARNED THAT A FAMILY BY THE NAME OF DIAZ NAVARRO LIVES THERE.  THERE
WERE NO FATALITIES, BUT DAMAGE TO THE BUILDINGS ARE REPORTED.

   NEWSMAN CONTRERAS VELEZ, PRENSA LIBRE EDITOR AND AUTHOR OF THE
"CACTO" COLUMN, CAME TO THE AREA TO OBSERVE THE DAMAGE.  IT WAS
UNOFFICIALLY ESTABLISHED THAT SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LIVE IN THIS
SECTOR. MUNICIPAL FIREMEN HELPED POLICE AUTHORITIES IN COMBING THE
AREA AFTER THE EXPLOSIONS.

   THE RUMOR THAT A CAR BOMB EXPLODED ON 7TH AVENUE AND 7TH STREET,
ZONE 9, CIRCULATED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY.  LATER, IT WAS LEARNED THAT
THE EXPLOSION WAS CAUSED BY A BOOBY TRAP.  THE AUTHORITIES ARE ON
ALERT AND STEPPED UP OPERATIONS, A POLICE SPOKESMAN SAID.

   AGAIN AT 2230 TONIGHT, NATIONAL POLICE EXPLOSIVE EXPERTS DISCOVERED
ANOTHER DEVICE IN THE VACANT LOT WHERE TWO OTHER BOMBS HAD GONE OFF
EARLIER.  TEN HOMES WERE DAMAGED BY ONE OF THE EXPLOSIONS, INCLUDING
THE HOMES OF DEPUTY FINANCES MINISTER GUSTAVO ADOLFO LEIVA AND
GUATEMALA GOVERNOR MARIO LOGORGON.  ONLY MATERIAL DAMAGE WAS CAUSED.
THE AREA RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE SITE.  ANOTHER CHARGE
WENT OFF IN FRONT OF THE AIR FORCE'S MAIN GATE ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME
THE FIRST BOMB WENT OFF.  AIR FORCE OFFICIALS CLOSED HINCAPIE AVENUE,
FROM LIBERACION BOULEVARD TO SANTA FE.  THE OFFICERS REPORTED MATERIAL
DAMAGE AND AND AN EXCHANGE OF FIRE IN THE AREA NEARBY.  FIREMEN AND
POLICEMEN AND SEVERAL ARMY ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS PATROLLING THE
CITY ARE MAINTANING SECURITY.

   TEL AVIV (ISRAEL), 17 MAY 90 (HADASHOT) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER ARIEL IRIAS RIVERA BY SHLOMO SLUTZKY]
[TEXT] WHEN HE BEGAN HIS JOB AS GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT AFTER DECADES OF
MILITARY REGIMES THAT LEFT BEHIND 100,000 FATALITIES, CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRAT MARCO VINICIO AREVALO CEREZO HAD PROMISES FOR THE FUTURE AND
THINGS TO HIS CREDIT IN THE PAST. THE THINGS TO HIS CREDIT WERE FOUR
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON HIM BECAUSE OF HIS ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE
DEMOCRACY IN HIS COUNTRY, AND HIS PROMISES WERE TO STOP POLITICAL
VIOLENCE, CORRUPTION, AND MAINLY THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EXTREME
RIGHT-WING DEATH SQUADS.

   CEREZO HAS BEEN IN THIS POST FOR FIVE YEARS.  NEW ELECTIONS ARE TO
BE HELD SOON, AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEATH SQUADS, SUPPORTED BY
ELEMENTS IN THE DEFENSE FORCES, HAVE NOT STOPPED.  THEY KILLED
HUNDREDS OF LABOR UNION LEADERS AND LEFTISTS.

   THE VISIT TO ISRAEL BY GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER ARIEL IRIAS
RIVERA PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN HIS
COUNTRY.  AFTER ALL, NO ONE AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS EXPRESSED AN
INTEREST IN IT.

   [SLUTZKY] BEFORE YOU CAME HERE, YOU SAID THAT YOU INTEND TO MAKE A
CONTRIBUTION HERE FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE IN BRINGING PEACE TO CENTRAL
AMERICA.  WHAT CAN THE MIDDLE EAST LEARN FROM CENTRAL AMERICA?

   [RIVERA] YOU CAN LEARN THAT PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED WITHOUT
VIOLENCE, THAT INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND GUARANTEES ARE IMPORTANT.
IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE PROPOSITION TO HOLD AN INTERNATIONAL
CONFERENCE IS THE ONE THAT EVENTUALLY WILL BRING PEACE TO YOUR AREA.
AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE AWARE OF THE LARGE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE
SITUATION IN OUR REGION, WHERE ALL THE PEOPLES HAVE THE SAME ORIGIN,
AND YOURS, WHERE NATIONAL, COMMUNITY, AND RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS ARE
INTERTWINED.

   [SLUTZKY] IT WAS SAID IN JERUSALEM THAT YOU HAVE NOT COME HERE TO
PURCHASE MILITARY EQUIPMENT.  THAT SORT OF CLARIFICATION DOES NOT
USUALLY PRECEDE A VISIT BY A FOREIGN MINISTER TO ISRAEL.

   [RIVERA] IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY WANTED TO CLARIFY AN ISSUE THAT
IS SELF-EVIDENT FOR US.  WITH US, WEAPON DEALS ARE CARRIED OUT BY
MILITARY PERSONNEL.

   [SLUTZKY] THE ISRAELI CHAPTER OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL WANTED TO
PRESENT YOU WITH A PETITION SIGNED BY HUNDREDS OF ISRAELIS DEMANDING
THAT HUMAN RIGHTS' ABUSE IN GUATEMALA IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS BE
INVESTIGATED.

   [RIVERA] I HAVE A DEEP RESPECT FOR AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, BUT WE
FEEL IT IS OUTDATED TO USE TOOLS FROM A DICTATORIAL PAST ON PRESENT
REGIMES.  IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT HAS A POLICY THAT
IS DIFFERENT FROM ITS PREDECESSORS'.  NEVERTHELESS, THERE STILL ARE
CENTERS OF RIGHT-WING POWER IN OUR COUNTRY; THOSE GROUPS FEAR THE
STABILIZATION OF DEMOCRACY.

   [SLUTZKY] CEREZO PROMISED TO INVESTIGATE ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN
GUATEMALA, INCLUDING ARMS AND DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY SALES.  HAS ANYTHING
BEEN DONE IN THAT RESPECT?

   [RIVERA] FROM WHAT I KNOW, ISRAEL SOLD WEAPONS TO GUATEMALA AT THE
FULL PRICE WHEN THE U.S. BOYCOTT WAS IN EFFECT AND OUR ARMY NEEDED
MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO FIGHT THE GUERRILLAS.  OTHER THAN THAT, OUR
DECISION IS NOT TO SCRATCH THE WOUNDS OF THE PAST, BUT TO WORRY ABOUT
PEACE IN THE FUTURE.

   [SLUTZKY] CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE ONE WITH GOOD
INTENTIONS, BUT WITHOUT COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE ARMY AND THOSE
CONNECTED WITH THE DEATH SQUADS.

   [RIVERA] THIS IS AN INCORRECT IMAGE.  I WOULD NOT SAY THAT IT IS
EASY TO OVERCOME ALL THE POWER ELEMENTS IN A FEW YEARS.  STILL, I CAN
SAY THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE IN THIS FIELD.  THE ARMY'S COMMAND
HEADED BY GENERAL GRAMAJO MORALES, THE DEFENSE MINISTER, GREATLY
ASSISTED THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION.

   [SLUTZKY] ARE THE ELEMENTS THAT TOOK PART IN THE COUPS NOT
CONNECTED TO THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING AND THE DEATH SQUADS WHICH
MURDERED HUNDREDS OF CITIZENS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, UNDER A
DEMOCRATIC REGIME?

   [RIVERA] IT IS VERY PROBABLE, BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THESE
ELEMENTS ARE A MINORITY, AFTER ALL.  THE OFFICERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN
THE FIRST COUP WERE PARDONED.  THE OFFICERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE
SECOND COUP WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL.  I BELIEVE THIS INDICATES A
POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT.

   [SLUTZKY] IN YOUR OPINION, WILL CEREZO BE ABLE TO APPEAR BEFORE THE
VOTERS IN A FEW MONTHS AND PROVE THAT HE HAS KEPT HIS PROMISES?

   [RIVERA] TO A LARGE EXTENT, YES.  ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEGUN;
POLITICAL AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ALLOWED; POLITICAL LEADERS
ARE NO LONGER SYSTEMATICALLY MURDERED AS IN THE PAST; AND THERE IS NO
VIOLENT SUPPRESSION OF DEMOCRATIC EXPRESSIONS.  CEREZO IS TRYING TO
PLAY THE DEMOCRATIC GAME ALL THE WAY.

   [JERUSALEM DOMESTIC SERVICE IN HEBREW AT 0400 GMT ON 17 MAY 90
REPORTS THAT "GUATEMALA WILL SET UP A CULTURAL CENTER IN JERUSALEM IN
THE BUILDING WHERE ITS CHANCERY WAS LOCATED UNTIL THE JERUSALEM LAW
WAS PASSED.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF ITS SENSITIVE POSITION IN
INTERNATIONAL FORUMS, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE THE EMBASSY BACK

   MANILA (PHILIPPINES), 18 MAY 90 (MANILA BULLETIN) -- [ARTICLE]
[OLAF S. GIRON] [EXCERPT] THE UNHOLY UNION OF ILLICIT DRUG TRAFFICKERS
AND POLITICAL TERRORISTS HAS BECOME EVIDENT IN THE PHILIPPINES AS IN
OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS PERU AND COLOMBIA, MILITARY AUTHORITIES SAID
YESTERDAY.

   VIOLENCE FUELED BY BIG DRUG PROFITS IS VIEWED AS A MAJOR THREAT TO
A NUMBER OF SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS, THEY ADDED.

   LAST MARCH, AUTHORITIES IN MANILA ARRESTED TWO NEW PEOPLE'S ARMY
(NPA) GUERRILLAS REPORTEDLY FROM THE ALEX BONCAYAO BRIGADE FOR
TRAFFICKING IN NARCOTICS.

   THE ARRESTS CAME AFTER A FOUR-MONTH INVESTIGATION OF REPORTS THAT
THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE PHILIPPINES (CPP) WAS INVOLVED IN DRUG
TRAFFICKING AS A MEANS TO SHORE UP RESOURCES FOR BUYING FIREARMS IN
VIEW OF DECLINING DONATIONS FROM SUPPORTERS IN EUROPE.

   FORTY-FOUR DECKS OF SHABU [METHAMPHETAMINE] WITH A STREET VALUE OF
P[PESO]154,000 WERE FOUND IN THE POSSESSION OF THE SUSPECTS.

   IN THE SAME MONTH, DRUG KINGPIN JOSE OYSON, ALSO KNOWN AS DON PEPE,
WAS KILLED WHILE GRAPPLING WITH POLICE AS HE WAS BEING TAKEN TO THE
NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (NBI) HEADQUARTERS FOR QUESTIONING.

   AFTER HIS ACQUITTAL FOR THE 1984 KILLING OF AN ANTI-DRUG CRUSADING
MANILA NEWSPAPER REPORTER, OYSON ALLEGEDLY ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS
WITH MAJOR DRUG SYNDICATE LEADERS IN HONG KONG AND TAIWAN.  HE ALSO
HAD BEEN UNDER SUSPICION OF FINANCING RIGHT-WING REVOLTS AGAINST
PRESIDENT AQUINO.

   THE ARRESTS OF THE TWO NPA GUERRILLAS PROVIDED THE FIRST HARD
EVIDENCE IN THE PHILIPPINES OF THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE OF NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKING AND TERRORISM THAT HAD ALREADY PLAGUED A NUMBER OF
GOVERNMENTS ELSEWHERE.

   AUTHORITIES SAID THEY ALSO SHOWED THAT ILLICIT DRUG PROFITS CAN
FUEL REVOLUTIONS FROM THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT WITH EQUAL MAGNANIMITY AND
EVEN SIMULTANEOUSLY.

   AS A PRIME EXAMPLE, IN COLOMBIA, POWERFUL COCAINE LEADERS WHO
WORKED IN CLOSE LEAGUE WITH COMMUNIST INSURGENTS 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO
HAVE TURNED AGAINST THE INSURGENTS AS THEIR STAGGERING DRUG PROFITS
ENABLED THEM TO BUY UP HUGE TRACTS OF RURAL FARM AND RANCH LAND AND
URBAN REAL ESTATE IN THE 1980S [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   MADRID (SPAIN), 17 MAY 90 (EFE) -- [EXCERPT] LIMA, 17 MAY (EFE) --
SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT TODAY SAID THAT THE "TEMPORARY
WITHDRAWAL" FROM THE STRUGGLE ANNOUNCED BY THE "SHINING PATH" PERUVIAN
MAOIST GUERRILLA GROUP ON ITS 10TH ANNIVERSARY IS A "PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR
OPERATION" INITIATED BY THE MILITARY.

   CIVILIAN SOURCES TOLD EFE THAT THE COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS RELEASED IN
AYACUCHO -- THE CRADLE OF THE "SHINING PATH" -- ANNOUNCING THE GROUP'S
TEMPORARY WITHDRAWAL FROM THE ARMED STRUGGLE "IS FICTITIOUS AND WAS
RELEASED BY THE ARMED FORCES TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNCERTAINTY IN
THE RANKS OF THE SHINING PATH" AT A TIME WHEN TERRORIST ACTIONS WERE
EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO MARK THE GROUP'S ANNIVERSARY.

   THE SOURCES SAID THAT THE COMMUNIQUE IS AIMED AT CONFUSING THE
SHINING PATH COMMANDOS, WHO ARE DIVIDED AND HAVE NO CLEAR
COMMUNICATION AMONG THEMSELVES OR WITH THEIR COMMANDING LEVELS. THE
SOURCES ADDED THAT THE COMMUNIQUE IS AIMED AT DELAYING OR ABORTING THE
ARMED ACTIONS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PLANNED FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW.

   THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN ON "RED ALERT" IN AYACUCHO TODAY TO
PREVENT THE SHINING PATH FROM CELEBRATING ITS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH
PROPAGANDA ATTACKS RECALLING THE BEGINNING OF THE "PEOPLE'S WAR" ON 17
JUNE 1980, WHEN THE GROUP ATTACKED AN ELECTORAL COURT OFFICE IN AN
ANDEAN TOWN.

   THE COMMUNIQUE, WHICH WAS RELEASED IN SUBURBAN AREAS OF AYACUCHO,
ANNOUNCED THAT THE PERUVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCP) -- WHICH IS THE
OFFICIAL NAME OF THE SHINING PATH -- HAS "TEMPORARILY" WITHDRAWN FROM
THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND WILL REORGANIZE ITSELF TO RETURN WITH "NEW
IMPETUS."

   THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE COMMUNIQUE WAS ALSO CALLED INTO QUESTION BY
AYACUCHO JOURNALISTIC AND UNIVERSITY SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE.  THEY
NOTED THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT COMMUNIQUES HAVE BEEN
ATTRIBUTED TO THE SHINING PATH.

   "WE ARE TEMPORARILY WITHDRAWING FORM THE ARMED STRUGGLE, BUT WE
WILL CONTINUE THE IDEOLOGICAL FIGHT AND EXAMINE AND EVALUATE THE
BRILLIANT ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE CARRIED OUT DURING THE PAST DECADE TO
RETURN ONCE AGAIN, WITH MORE IDEAS AND A DETERMINATION THAT WILL
PERMIT A STRATEGIC BALANCE UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES," THE COMMUNIQUE
STATES.

   "IT IS TIME FOR US TO SAY THAT THE TIME FOR CRIME FOR THE SAKE OF
CRIME IS PASSED AND THAT THE CULT OF PERSONALITY IS ALSO OVER," IT
ADDS. CONTRARY TO STANDARD SHINING PATH PRACTICE, THE NOTE, WHICH IS
SIGNED BY THE "PCP-RANK-AND-FILE," DOES NOT MENTION THE MOVEMENT'S TOP
LEADER AND FOUNDER ABIMAEL GUZMAN, KNOWN BY HIS SUPPORTERS AS
"PRESIDENT GONZALO." SPECIALISTS BELIEVE THAT THIS PHRASE IS AN ATTACK
AGAINST THE MORE MILITARIST SECTOR OF THE SHINING PATH AND AGAINST
GUZMAN, AND THAT IT SEEKS TO FOMENT DIVISION WITHIN THE SHINING PATH.

   SOME SPECIALISTS IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE GROUP HAVE SAID THAT
THERE IS A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE MORE MODERATE SECTOR, KNOWN AS
THE "BLACK" WING, AND THE "RED" ORTHODOX, MILITARIST WING. OTHER
OBSERVERS HAVE SAID THAT THERE ARE ONLY "FISSURES" CONCERNING
OPERATIONAL METHODS. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

[CARLOS VARGAS] [TEXT] THE PRESUMED SUBVERSIVE GROUP M-20 [20 DECEMBER
MOVEMENT] THREATENED ON 15 MAY TO ENTER THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND FREE
THE REFUGEES THERE.  IT ALSO CALLED SEVERAL MEDIA CLAIMING THAT IT HAD
KIDNAPPED A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AND PLACED BOMBS IN SEVERAL GOVERNMENT
OFFICES.

   IN VIEW OF THE TELEPHONE CALLS, THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH FOREIGN
MINISTER JULIO LINARES, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS STRENGTHENED POLICE
PROTECTION AROUND THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN THIS CAPITAL.

   FORMER PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES OFFICERS GONZALO GONZALEZ AND
HERACLIDES SUCRE, CLOSE COLLABORATORS OF OVERTHROWN GENERAL MANUEL
NORIEGA, ARE REFUGEES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  GONZALEZ IS ALLEGEDLY
INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF SEVERAL MILITARY OFFICERS WHO TRIED
UNSUCCESSFULLY TO OVERTHROW NORIEGA ON 3 OCTOBER 1989.  FOREIGN
MINISTER LINARES REVEALED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY HAD RECEIVED TWO
TELEPHONE CALLS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS M-20
MEMBERS AND THREATENED TO ENTER THE EMBASSY GROUNDS TO FREE THE
REFUGEES THERE.

   SECURITY AROUND THE EMBASSY WAS REINFORCED, ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN
STRENGTHENED EARLIER AFTER SEVERAL OFFICERS OF THE FORMER REGIME
SOUGHT ASYLUM THERE.

   MEANWHILE, THE DIRECTOR OF THE "INSTITUTO AMERICA" HIGH SCHOOL
DENIED THE M-20'S CLAIM THAT IT WAS HOLDING, AND THREATENED TO KILL, A
STUDENT FROM THAT SCHOOL.

   ALSO ON 15 MAY, PANAMANIAN AND AMERICAN POLICEMEN HAD TO ORDER THE
EVACUATION OF WORKERS FROM SEVERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN THE BANKING
AREA OF VIA ESPANA DUE TO REPORTED BOMB THREATS FROM THE M- 20.

   THE M-20 ALLEGEDLY IS A GROUP OF SUPPORTERS OF OVERTHROWN GENERAL
NORIEGA WHO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MARCH TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE
"MY PLACE" BAR.  ONE U.S. SOLDIER WAS KILLED AND 20 PANAMANIANS WERE
WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK.

   FOREIGN MINISTER LINARES SAID THAT HE COULD NOT CONFIRM THE
EXISTENCE OF THE M-20.

   A NUMBER OF DAYS AGO THE SOUTHERN COMMAND OFFERED A $10,000 REWARD
TO ANY PERSON WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION LEADING TO THE ARREST OF THE
MAN WHO THREW THE BOMB INTO THE AFOREMENTIONED BAR.

   IT WAS ALSO LEARNED THAT THE JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE ARE TRYING
TO TRACE THE TELEPHONE CALLS, WHICH HAVE SCARED THE CITIZENS SOMEWHAT.

   MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, WHO HAS TAKEN REFUGE AT THE PERUVIAN
EMBASSY, WAS ALSO ACCUSED OF BEING THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE DEATH OF
YOUNG MELQUIADES RODRIGUEZ JUSTINE, A GRANDSON OF FORMER COLONEL
JUSTINE.

THE TERMS ARE STILL BEING DISCUSSED.

   THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT REQUESTED 20 YEARS TO PAY THE DEBT, A
SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AND A FOUR-YEAR [GRACE PERIOD] ON THE INTEREST.
THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT (WHICH ALONG
WITH VENEZUELA PARTICIPATES IN THE OIL SUPPLY AGREEMENT).  THE
PROPOSAL WILL THEN BE PRESENTED AT THE UPCOMING CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS SUMMIT.

   DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH VENEZUELAN AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS,
THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT, WHO ARRIVED ON 17 MAY IN VENEZUELA, SAID
THAT TO CONSOLIDATE PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE
GRADUAL DEMILITARIZATION, WITH THE RESULTING REDUCTION IN WEAPONS AND
LOCAL ARMIES, "WHICH SHOULD BE LEFT UNSUITED TO CARRY OUT EXTERNAL
ATTACKS."

   CONCERNING NICARAGUA, CEREZO SAID THE PROFESSIONALIZATION AND
IDEOLOGICAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE ARMY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO REAFFIRMING ITS
DEMOCRACY.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 19 MAY 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE BUS STRIKE IN
GUATEMALA CITY CONTINUED FOR THE FOURTH DAY TODAY.  LAST NIGHT, THERE
WERE NEW DISTURBANCES AND TERRORIST BOMBS WERE SET OFF.

   ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION HAS CAUSED GREAT DISCONTENT AMONG THE 1.2
MILLION PEOPLE OF THE CAPITAL, THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOR THE TIME BEING
REJECTED THE MUNICIPALITY'S REQUEST TO PLACE THE BUS SERVICES UNDER
MILITARY CONTROL.

   THE BUS OWNERS ARE ASKING FOR A 100-PERCENT INCREASE IN THE 20
CENTAVO ($.05) FARE, ARGUING THAT INFLATION HAS INCREASED THE PRICE OF
GASOLINE AND THE BUS MAINTENANCE COSTS.  HOWEVER, THE MUNICIPALITY HAS
NOT AUTHORIZED THE INCREASE, FEARING A GENERALIZED PROTEST BY BUS
PASSENGERS.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 18 MAY 90 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] NINE YEARS AGO TODAY, THEN ECUADORAN PRESIDENT JAIME ROLDOS
AGUILERA DIED WHEN HIS PLANE CRASHED WHILE ON A FLIGHT TO THE INTERIOR
OF HIS COUNTRY. THE SMALL PLANE SUFFERED THE ACCIDENT WHILE FLYING THE
PRESIDENT, HIS WIFE, AND A DELEGATION THAT INCLUDED HIGH- RANKING ARMY
OFFICERS FROM QUITO TO LOJA PROVINCE.  ALL OF THEM DIED.  THE
RELATIVES OF THE LATE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THE PLANE
CRASHED ACCIDENTALLY AND FILED CHARGES AS PRIVATE CITIZENS, BUT THE
CASE WAS LATER CLOSED.

   DOUBTS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE ALLEGED
ACCIDENT, AND THE CASE RESURFACED AGAIN WHEN A NEW INVESTIGATION WAS
OPENED AND ONE OF THE WITNESSES DISCLOSED THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE OF
PARTICIPATION BY THE U.S. CIA IN THE DEATH OF ROLDOS AND HIS RETINUE.
ERNESTO BUENANO, ROLDOS' POLITICAL ADVISER, ASSERTED BEFORE A
MULTIPARTY COMMISSION OF THE ECUADORAN CONGRESS THAT THE PLANE
ACCIDENT IN WHICH THE FORMER PRESIDENT DIED DID NOT RESULT FROM HUMAN
ERROR OR TECHNICAL FAILURE BUT FROM SABOTAGE, WHICH CONSISTED OF
CONTAMINATING THE PLANE'S FUEL TO CAUSE ITS ENGINES TO STALL.  THE
WITNESS POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS INCONTESTABLE EVIDENCE ABOUT THIS
AND URGED THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONS WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPLYING FUEL TO THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE.

   IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT ROLDOS' ADMINISTRATION WAS
CHARACTERIZED BY A PROGRESSIVE ORIENTATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY BY
HIS DIRECT OPPOSITION TO U.S. ATTEMPTS TO DOMINATE THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES.  THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS OPENLY IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE
SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF NICARAGUA AND THE SALVADORAN
INSURGENTS.  HIS ADOPTION OF THIS STANCE LED U.S.  IMPERIALISM TO
CONSIDER THE ROLDOS DOCTRINE AS A DANGER TO ITS INTERESTS.

   WHEN ONE RECALLS THE POSITION OF THE FORMER ECUADORAN PRESIDENT,
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FORMER PANAMANIAN LEADER OMAR TORRIJOS HERRERA
ALSO COMES TO MIND.  TORRIJOS' DEATH WAS SIMILAR IN CIRCUMSTANCES TO
THAT OF JAIME ROLDOS, AND HIS PATRIOTIC ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HIS
COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY WAS ALSO SIMILAR.  TORRIJOS AND ROLDOS WERE A
NUISANCE TO U.S. PLANS IN LATIN AMERICA AND BOTH WERE MURDERED, AS
VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE DISCLOSED.  FORMER CHILEAN PRESIDENT SALVADOR
ALLENDE [WORDS INDISTINCT] IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE CIA'S HAND
DIRECTLY TOOK HIS LIFE, THE ORGANIZATION DID HELP DESTABILIZE HIS
PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT.

   THE INVESTIGATIONS ON JAIME ROLDOS' DEATH AND WHAT WAS SAID AT THE
TIME ABOUT THE ALLEGED ACCIDENT SUFFERED BY OMAR TORRIJOS REVEAL ONCE
MORE THE SINISTER PLANS OF THE U.S. CIA AGAINST OUR LATIN AMERICAN AND
CARIBBEAN PEOPLE, WHO MUST REMAIN ON THE ALERT.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 19 MAY 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT
VINICIO CEREZO LEFT HERE TODAY FOR HIS COUNTRY AT 1400 (1600 GMT), OFFICIAL
SOURCES IN THE VENEZUELAN CAPITAL HAVE CONFIRMED.

   CEREZO, WHO WAS VISITING CARACAS OFFICIALLY SINCE 17 MAY, SIGNED
TWO TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION AGREEMENTS ON ENERGY MATTERS
WITH HIS VENEZUELAN COUNTERPART CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.

   THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT ALSO SECURED AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO
REFINANCE THE GUATEMALAN OIL DEBT TO VENEZUELA IN THE AMOUNT OF $200
MILLION FOR A 20-YEAR TERM, WITH A 6-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AT 4 PERCENT
INTEREST.

   VENEZUELA SUPPLIES GUATEMALA WITH 7,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY
WITHIN THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT WHEREIN IT IS ENGAGED WITH MEXICO TO
SELL OIL UNDER SPECIAL TERMS TO CENTRAL AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN
NATIONS.

   CEREZO SAID THAT THE TOTAL DEBT OF THE COUNTRIES WHO BENEFIT FROM
THE OIL SUPPLIED BY MEXICO AND VENEZUELA AMOUNTS TO $3 BILLION, FOR
WHICH INTERNATIONAL REFINANCING IS SOUGHT.  THIS TOPIC WILL BE
BROACHED AT THE UPCOMING CENTRAL AMERICAN ECONOMIC SUMMIT TO BE HELD
IN GUATEMALA.

   THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT WAS SEEN OFF AT THE MAIQUETIA
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT BY PRESIDENT PEREZ.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 MAY 90 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] A MILITARY SPOKESMAN
HAS REPORTED THAT ONE CIVILIAN WAS KILLED AND FIVE OTHER PEOPLE,
INCLUDING A POLICEMAN, WERE INJURED TODAY AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION
OF A GRENADE THROWN AT A POLICE PATROL CAR BY ALLEGED URBAN GUERRILLA
COMMANDOS.

   THE CIVILIAN WHO WAS KILLED HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS JOSE OVIDIO
GOMEZ, A TAXI DRIVER, AND THE INJURED POLICEMAN IS RICARDO ANTONIO
MARTINEZ.  MARTINEZ AND THE OTHER PERSONS WHO WERE INJURED, SOME
SERIOUSLY, WERE TAKEN TO A SAN SALVADOR MEDICAL CENTER.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, THE GRENADE WAS THROWN AT 0630 (1230 GMT)
TODAY.  THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE NEAR THE CENTRAL MARKETPLACE, SAN
SALVADOR'S MOST IMPORTANT SUPPLY CENTER, WHICH IS VERY CROWDED AT THAT
TIME OF DAY.

   THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS, BUT
THE GUERRILLAS HAVE NOT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR IT.

   THIS IS THE FIRST ATTACK THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE SALVADORAN
CAPITAL SINCE THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT BEGAN LAST WEDNESDAY IN
VENEZUELA.

   THE TALKS ARE IN THEIR SIXTH DAY TODAY AND THERE IS AN ATMOSPHERE
OF OPTIMISM.  ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE DIALOGUE, IMPORTANT
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TO SECURE THE PACIFICATION OF EL SALVADOR,
WHICH FOR A DECADE HAS BEEN ENDURING A CIVIL WAR IN WHICH MORE THAN
70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED.  


DEV-MUC3-1297 (BOEING)

   SANTIAGO, 21 MAY 90 (EFE) -- [ARTICLE] [NELSON SANDOVAL] [TEXT]
CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN WILL TODAY REPORT ON THE FIRST 70
DAYS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION AND WILL MAKE IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS
CONCERNING HIS FUTURE PLANS IN A SPEECH TO A PLENARY MEETING OF THE
CHILEAN CONGRESS THAT WILL MARK THE BEGINNING OF SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL
SESSIONS.

   AYLWIN'S SPEECH AWAKENS CONSIDERABLE EXPECTATION BECAUSE OF RECENT
UNPUBLICIZED CLASHES BETWEEN AYLWIN'S ADMINISTRATION AND GENERAL
AUGUST PINOCHET, WHO HAS BEEN THROWING HIS WEIGHT AROUND AS COMMANDER
IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY, AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE GROWING RIGHTWING
OPPOSITION TO THE ACTIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION.

   POLITICAL ANALYSTS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH
WILL COINCIDE WITH THE "END OF A GOVERNMENT-OPPOSITION HONEYMOON" THAT
HAD MARKED THE INITIAL WEEKS OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION.

   THE ADMINISTRATION'S INITIATIVES REGARDING HUMAN RIGHTS, TAX
REFORM, THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND OTHER STEPS
AIMED AT DEPRIVING MILITARY COURTS OF THEIR POWERS HAVE WORSENED THE
CONFLICT AND HAVE MADE THINGS MORE DIFFICULT FOR AYLWIN'S
ADMINISTRATION.

   THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE, WHILE THE RIGHTWING PARTIES ARE LEANING
MORE AND MORE TOWARD PINOCHET EVERY DAY AND LONGING FOR HIS
AUTHORITARIAN REGIME, THE LEFTWING PARTIES AND EVEN SECTORS OF THE
COALITION OF PARTIES FOR DEMOCRACY HAVE BEEN CRITICIZING AYLWIN FOR
ALLEGED "LUKEWARM" APPROACH TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC
CHANGES THAT HE PROMISED DURING HIS ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.

   THE RIGHTWING HAS TAKEN DUE ADVANTAGE OF SEVERAL UNSOLVED TERRORIST
ATTACKS OVER THE RECENT WEEKS TO PROP UP ITS OPPOSITION IN CONGRESS TO
BILLS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS.

   HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO RECENT OPINION POLLS, AYLWIN WILL MAKE HIS
SPEECH AMID GROWING POPULARITY, MUCH HIGHER THAN THE SUPPORT HE
OBTAINED AT THE 14 DECEMBER ELECTIONS.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH TO CONGRESS AT THE LEGISLATIVE PALACE IN
VALPARAISO, 125 KM WEST OF SANTIAGO, WILL MARK THE RETURN TO A LONG-STANDING
DEMOCRATIC TRADITION THAT CHILEANS USED TO ENJOY EVERY 21 MAY.

   ON THIS DAY, THE REPORT TO CONGRESS WAS YET ANOTHER REASON FOR
POPULAR REJOICING BECAUSE IT COINCIDED WITH THE "NAVAL GLORIES DAY"
WHICH IS ALSO COMMEMORATED ON 21 MAY IN MEMORY OF THE CHILE'S TOP
NAVAL HERO ARTURO PRAT WHO DIED IN THE NAVAL BATTLE OF IQUIQUE DURING
THE 1879 PACIFIC WAR.

   SINCE CONGRESS WAS CLOSED DOWN DURING THE MILITARY REGIME, GENERAL
AUGUSTO PINOCHET USED TO READ HIS STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS ON 11
SEPTEMBER, THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE MILITARY COUP D'ETAT THROUGH WHICH
HE SEIZED POWER.

   ACCORDING TO POLITICAL ANALYSTS, AYLWIN'S SPEECH MAY PROVIDE THE
KEY TO THE LAYOUT OF CHILE'S TRANSITION IN THE FUTURE.  THE MANNER IN
WHICH THE PRESIDENT WILL MAKE HIS REPORT IS RATHER CURIOUS BECAUSE
THEORETICALLY THIS REPORT SHOULD ENCOMPASS ONE YEAR OF GOVERNMENT,
WHILE AYLWIN HAS BEEN PRESIDENT FOR ONLY 70 DAYS DURING WHICH THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN HARSHLY CRITICIZED BY THE RIGHTWING EVERY TIME
THE ADMINISTRATION HAD SOMETHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THE PRIOR MILITARY
REGIME.

   GENERAL PINOCHET PERSONALLY TOLD AYLWIN THAT HE FELT OFFENDED BY
AYLWIN'S LABOR DAY CELEBRATION SPEECH ON 1 MAY.

   DURING HIS LATEST PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, PINOCHET TOLD
AYLWIN THAT HE FELT THAT THE "TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION" COMMISSION
THAT AYLWIN HAD CREATED TO INVESTIGATE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS DURING
THE MILITARY REGIME WAS A DIRECT ATTACK ON THE ARMY.

   PINOCHET ALSO TOLD AYLWIN THAT BY WAY OF "PROTEST" AGAINST THESE
ACTIONS HE WOULD NOT ATTEND THE LUNCHEON TO WHICH THE PRESIDENT HAD
INVITED ALL THE COMMANDERS OF THE ARMED FORCES BRANCHES.

   ACCORDING TO LEAKS ABOUT THIS MEETING, AYLWIN TOLD PINOCHET: "WATCH
YOUR STEP, GENERAL" AND REMINDED HIM THAT OFFENSIVE BEHAVIOR AGAINST
THE PRESIDENT COULD HARM PINOCHET'S IMAGE EVEN WITHIN HIS OWN
INSTITUTION, THE ARMY.

   PINOCHET DID NOT ATTEND THE LUNCHEON, HOWEVER, SENDING INSTEAD
GENERAL HUGO SALAS, THE THIRD HIGHEST-RANKING ARMY OFFICER AND THE
FORMER CHIEF OF THE CNI [NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER], THE SECRET
POLICE OF HIS REGIME.

   PINOCHET FAILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO CONVOKE THE NATIONAL SECURITY
COUNCIL AND TO MAKE THIS COUNCIL ISSUE A STATEMENT AGAINST THE "TRUTH
AND RECONCILIATION" COMMISSION, BUT PINOCHET'S SORTIE IN THE POLITICAL
ARENA AWOKE CONCERN LACED WITH FEAR, AS ONE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
ADMITTED TO EFE.  THE SOURCE, WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, ADDED
THAT "PINOCHET IS AWARE OF THE FEAR HE AWAKENS AND HE USES IT
ADROITLY."

   THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL NOT ATTEND THE TODAY'S CEREMONY IN
CONGRESS ALTHOUGH THE COMMANDERS OF THE OTHER ARMED FORCES BRANCHES,
THE VERY SAME ONES THAT DID NOT SUPPORT HIS ATTEMPT TO CONVOKE THE
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WILL BE PRESENT.

   PINOCHET CLAIMED THAT HE HAS "INSTITUTIONAL REASONS" FOR HIS
ABSENCE AND HAS LEFT FOR NORTHERN CHILE WHERE HE IS CURRENTLY TOURING
ARMY GARRISONS.

   ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT THE "PINOCHET EFFECT" WILL BE NOTICEABLE IN
AYLWIN'S SPEECH THROUGH GREATER MODERATION IN ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW
INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AND THROUGH MORE BENIGN ASSESSMENTS OF THE
PREVIOUS MILITARY REGIME.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] INFORMS THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY:

   1.  SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE INITIATION OF THE CARACAS MEETING ON 16
MAY, THE ARMED FORCES LAUNCHED A GENERAL OFFENSIVE WITH AERIAL
BOMBINGS, MASSIVE ARTILLERY ATTACKS, AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF
PARATROOPERS AND INFANTRY SOLDIERS TO ALL OUR RURAL FRONTS.  FOLLOWING
FIVE DAYS OF INTENSE COMBAT, WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT IT IS A ROUTINE
OPERATION AND NOT A LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE.

   2.  OUR FORCES HAVE REJECTED THE ENEMY'S GENERAL OFFENSIVE AND TO
DATE HAVE DOWNED ONE HELICOPTER, DAMAGED TWO OTHERS, AND INFLICTED
DOZENS OF CASUALTIES ON THE ENEMY TROOPS.  WE DENY THAT COMMANDER
LEONCIO PICHINTE WAS KILLED IN COMBAT.

   3.  WHILE THE GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE FMLN OF HAVING VIOLATED THE
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE TALKS, CRISTIANI AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE
PROCESS HAVE BEEN MAKING A SERIES OF STATEMENTS CONCERNING
CONFIDENTIAL ISSUES.

   4.  FROM THE SIGNING OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS
INCREASED ITS INTERFERENCE OF OUR RADIO VENCEREMOS AND RADIO FARABUNDO
MARTI, WHICH REFLECTS THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS. IT CANNOT STAND TO
HAVE OUR POSITIONS KNOWN.  THEREFORE, THERE IS CLEARLY NO FREEDOM OF
EXPRESSION, WHICH IN TURN DELAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF A CEASE-FIRE
BECAUSE IT HINDERS THE NATIONAL DEBATE WE NEED IN ORDER TO REACH A
POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   5.  FROM THE ABOVE SITUATION, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS
USED THE CARACAS MEETING AS PART OF A WAR PLAN, WITH CRISTIANI
PARTICIPATING AT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE LEVEL WITH A VIEW TO
POINTING OUT THE CONTRADICTORINESS OF THE FMLN'S POLITICAL ACTIVITY.

   WITH THE NEGOTIATION AND THE INTERFERENCE OF OUR RADIO STATIONS,
THE FMLN HAS SILENCED THE CONFIDENTIALITY ARGUMENT, WHILE THE ARMY IS
TRYING TO MILITARILY ANNIHILATE US AND IS OPENLY PROCLAIMING IT BY
SAYING THAT IT HAS ATTACKED COMMAND POSTS AND KILLED FMLN LEADERS.

   6.  THE FMLN REITERATES THAT AS LONG AS A CEASE-FIRE IS NOT AGREED
UPON THROUGH A POLITICAL AGREEMENT THAT WILL END THE ARMY'S IMPUNITY,
AND SPECIFIC PLEDGES ARE NOT MADE TO DEMILITARIZE THE COUNTRY, IT
RESERVES THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF EVEN BY LAUNCHING
OFFENSIVES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR SCOPE, WHENEVER NECESSARY ANYWHERE
WITHIN THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

   BOGOTA, 21 MAY 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I ADDRESS YOU AT
A MOMENT WHEN ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS ARE FILLED WITH PAIN.  TERRORIST
ACTIONS HAVE BROUGHT SADNESS AND MOURNING TO DOZENS OF OUR POOR HOMES,
AS WELL AS TO FAMILIES OF NATIONAL LEADERS.  COLOMBIA'S ENEMIES HAVE
DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO ATTACKING UNARMED CITIZENS.  THEIR INSANE
ACTIONS ARE ENDING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND HONEST
COLOMBIANS.  AT THESE TRYING TIMES, I SEND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IRRATIONAL WAVE OF MONSTROUS CRIMES MY
DEEPEST SENTIMENTS OF SOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TELL ALL THE VICTIMS'
RELATIVES AND FRIENDS THAT WE SHARE THEIR SORROW AND SADNESS.

   THE COUNTRY AND ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN DEALT A STRONG BLOW
TODAY.  ANOTHER GREAT MAN HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED.  LIBERAL LEADER
FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ WAS VIOLENTLY MURDERED IN THE STREETS OF
MEDELLIN.  THE LOSS OF SENATOR ESTRADA VELEZ LEAVES THE LIBERAL PARTY
AND ANTIOQUIANS WITHOUT ONE OF ITS GREAT LEADERS.  HE IS TO BE ADDED
TO THE LIST OF MARTYRS THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THEIR THOUGHTS AND
BRAVE ATTITUDE IN CONFRONTING THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS.  FEDERICO
ESTRADA WAS A FIGHTER IN THIS ADMINISTARTION AND, AS OUR COLOMBIAN
AMBASSADOR TO ITALY, CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH
THAT COUNTRY AND WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.  THE COUNTRY RECALLS HIM
FOR HIS RECENT ACTIONS AS THE PROPONENT AND PROMOTER OF THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS PROJECT AT THE SENATE.  HIS BRILLANT POLITICAL
AND PROFESSIONAL CAREER ALLOWED HIM TO REACH THE HIGHEST POSITIONS OF
THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS AND OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  HE WAS A SUPREME
COURT MAGISTRATE, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, PARLIAMENTARIAN, THE NATIONAL
AND DEPARTMENTAL LEADER OF THE LIBERAL PARTY, A PUBLIC SERVANT OF MANY
YEARS, AND A TIRELESS WORKER FOR THE WELLBEING OF THE PEOPLE OF
ANTIOQUA.  HIS LIFE WAS ENDED AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY AND HIS PARTY
NEEDED HIS EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE.

   TO HIS WIFE, HIS FOUR CHILDREN, HIS FOLLOWERS, AND ALL ANTIOQUEANS,
I SEND A HEARTFELT MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE IN THE NAME OF ALL HIS FELLOW
COUNTRYMEN.  THE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THIS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.  ALL
COLOMBIANS GET ANGRY EACH TIME A BARBARIC ACT TAKES PLACE AND EACH
TIME ONE OF OUR LEADERS IS MURDERED.  LET US TURN THIS ANGER INTO A
PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTIONS, IN A
DECIDED ACTION BY ALL AGAINST THE EMPIRE OF CRIME, AND IN EFFECTIVE
SOLIDARITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  RECOVERING PEACE AND
TRANQUILLITY IS A JOINT TASK.  EVERY DAY WE MUST DEMAND MORE
EFFICIENCY FROM OUR PUBLIC FORCES BUT WE MUST ALSO GIVE THEM MORE
SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN EFFICIENTLY COMPLY WITH THEIR
SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES.  THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DOING;
IT HAS SUPPORTED THEM MORALLY AND MATERIALLY.

   TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND IMPUNITY DEPENDS ABOVE ALL ON THE
COOPERATION OF CITIZENS.  WE MUST ALL BECOME LIKE SOLDIERS IN THE
SEARCH FOR PEACE BECAUSE THE FUTURE OF OUR FAMILIES, OUR PRINCIPLES,
OUR RIGHTS, AND OUR DEMOCRACY ARE AT STAKE.  LET THOSE WHO PROMOTE
VIOLENCE FACE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY OF 30 MILLION HONEST COLOMBIANS.  NO
ONE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PAINFUL MOMENT THE COUNTRY IS
ENDURING.  THE INTERESTS OF COLOMBIA ARE ABOVE ALL OTHER
CONSIDERATIONS.

   ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE DECISION BY THE HONORABLE
SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND AFTER A
THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RECENT PUBLIC ORDER DISTURBANCES, I HAVE
DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE TO SEND THE FOREIGN MINISTER TO REPRESENT
COLOMBIA AT THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

   AS YOU ARE AWARE, THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BEGIN
TOMORROW IN CUZCO, PERU.  THIS MEETING WAS CALLED WITH THE OBJECTIVE
OF ACHIEVING NEW PROGRESS IN THE INTEGRATION OF THE SUBREGION, THROUGH
NEW MECHANISMS FOR INTEGRATION AND WITH THE CREATION OF THE ANDEAN
PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER WILL BE ENTRUSTED WITH REAFFIRMING COLOMBIA'S
FULL COMMITMENT TO THE INTEGRATION PROCESS AND TO CONCERTED NEW JOINT
ACTIONS WITH PERU, ECUADOR, BOLIVIA, AND VENEZUELA TO FACE THE PROBLEM
OF THE CONSUMPTION, SMUGGLING, AND DRUG PRODUCTION.

   FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I HEREBY REITERATE MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO ALL
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE.  IT IS AT THIS TIME OF
SORROW AND SADNESS WHEN WE COLOMBIANS SHOULD BE MORE UNITED THAN EVER.
I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO USE THE SUFFERING AND THE MEMORIES OF THOSE
WHO HAVE FALLEN AS A FORCE THAT WILL GIVE US MORE COURAGE AND
DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE TO PROGRESS IN BUILDING COLOMBIA IN PEACE,
FREE OF TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE.  GOOD NIGHT.

   QUITO, 21 MAY 90 (RADIO QUITO) -- [REPORT] [ALVARO GOMEZ] [TEXT]
ALL MEDIA IN GUAYAQUIL AND MANY CORRESPONDENTS WHO HAVE COME TO THE
PORT OF GUAYAQUIL TO COVER THE FOURTH ALFARO LIVES DAMMIT [AVC]
NATIONAL CONFERENCE ARE STILL UNAWARE OF WHERE THE MEETING IS BEING
HELD.  THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF THIS GROUP WILL BE
DISCUSSED AT THIS MEETING.  THE FOUR-DAY MEETING BEGAN ON 18 MAY AT
THE GUAYAS ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL.  HOWEVER, THE MEETING WAS CONTINUED
LATER AT AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION IN GUAYAQUIL.  DURING THEIR SESSIONS,
IN ADDITION TO MAKING A DECISION ON THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS, AVC
LEADERS WILL ALSO ASSESS THE AGREEMENT THEY SIGNED A YEAR AGO WITH THE
PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA GOVERNMENT.  THE ACCORD MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR
THEM TO CEASE THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN EXCHANGE FOR A GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE
WITH SOCIAL SECTORS IN THE COUNTRY.  PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE
FOURTH AVC NATIONAL CONFERENCE, AVC LEADER SANTIAGO DILLMAN REPORTED
ON 18 MAY THAT THE FINAL DECISION ON THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS WAS A
LOGICAL STEP -- AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ARMED
STRUGGLE IN ECUADOR AND IN THE REST OF LATIN AMERICA IS NO LONGER THE
PROPER COURSE.  THEREFORE, HE ANNOUNCED, THIS ALFARIST MEETING WILL
ALSO ANALYZE THE DECISION TO ORGANIZE A NEW POLITICAL PARTY OR TO
ALLOW AVC LEADERS TO JOIN AN ALREADY EXISTING GROUP RECOGNIZED BY THE
SUPREME ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL.

   THESE ARE SOME OF THE POINTS ON THE AGENDA OF THE AVC MEETING,
WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE ON 21 OR 22 MAY WITH A HISTORICAL
RESOLUTION.  HOWEVER, AVC LEADERS -- AMONG THEM SANTIAGO DILLMAN,
MARCO TROYA, PEDRO MONCADA, AND JANETH SOSA -- HAVE PREFERRED NOT TO
DISCLOSE THE SITE OF THE MEETING, WHICH HAS FRUSTRATED THE WORK OF
JOURNALISTS.  THE AVC LEADERS PLAN TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF
DELIVERING WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF AVC MEMBERS TO A SOCIALIST
INTERNATIONAL DELEGATION IN A CEREMONY SIMILAR TO ONE RECENTLY HELD BY
THE 19-APRIL MOVEMENT IN COLOMBIA, WHICH IN THE PAST HAS STAGED
SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN MILITARY ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE KIDNAPPING OF
BUSINESSMAN NAIM ISAIAS WITH THE HELP OF THE AVC.

   THE AVC HAS SAID IT WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COUNTRY'S
INSTITUTIONAL LIFE.  IN ORDER TO DO THIS, IT WILL PLEDGE TO SURRENDER
ITS WEAPONS -- THE SYMBOL OF ITS REBELLION -- WHICH IT WILL CONTINUE
WITH OR WITHOUT WEAPONS, AVC LEADERS HAVE SAID.  THE AVC LEADERS
CONTINUE MEETING AT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION IN GUAYAQUIL AND EXPECT TO
REACH AN AGREEMENT SOON ON LAYING DOWN THEIR WEAPONS, WHICH WOULD THEN
BE DESTROYED IMMEDIATELY.
