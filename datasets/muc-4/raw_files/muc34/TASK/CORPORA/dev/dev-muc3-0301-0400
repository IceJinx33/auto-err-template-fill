   SAN SALVADROR, 19 JUL 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS GIVEN ASSURANCES THAT THERE WILL BE NO
MILITARY INTERVENTION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EL SALVADOR CAMPUS, DESPITE
THE VIOLENT INCIDENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS.
THESE INCIDENTS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN ANY DEATHS, ALTHOUGH SEVERAL
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED.  THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE INCIDENTS AT
THE UNIVERSITY ARE PART OF A BROADER PLAN TO PROVOKE THE 1ST BRIGADE
TROOPS PATROLLING THE AREA.  HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENT ADDED, THERE WILL
BE NO MILITARY INTERVENTION AT THE UNIVERSITY, EVEN IF THE SOLDIERS
WHO ARE SURROUNDING THE CAMPUS ARE PROVOKED.

   TWO STUDENTS WHO WERE ARRESTED LAST WEEK AND WHO WERE PRESENTED BY THE
TREASURY POLICE HAVE ADMITTED THEIR PARTICIPATION IN LEFTIST, DESTABILIZING
GROUPS' ACTIVITIES.  ONE OF THE STUDENTS ARRESTED IS LUIS OSVALDO SANDOVAL,
A FIFTH - GRADE STUDENT AT THE JOSE MATIAS SALGADO SCHOOL, WHO ADMITTED
BEING A MEMBER OF THE BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM MOVEMENT AND THAT HE
HAS PARTICIPATED IN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS WRITING MESSAGES AND PASTING
PROPAGANDA ON WALLS AND BURNING VEHICLES.

   THE SECOND STUDENT ARRESTED IS RAMON PARADA GARCIA, A 2D - YEAR STUDENT
AT THE (ALFREDO BAN FERRER NATIONAL INSTITUTE), WHO SAID THAT HE IS A
MEMBER OF THE ERP [PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY].  THE TWO YOUTHS SAID THAT
THEY JOINED THESE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE PAID ON A MONTHLY BASIS,
EXPLAINING THAT THEIR FAMILIES HAVE NO OTHER SOURCE OF INCOME.  THE
TREASURY POLICE SAID THAT THE ARRESTED STUDENTS HAVE REQUESTED THE
PROTECTION OF THAT SECURITY FORCE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 JUL 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [EXCERPT] WE HAVE
FURTHER REPORTS ON THIS MORNING'S ATTACK ON GUILLERMO PAYES, SECOND IN
CHARGE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS INSTITUTE [IRI].  AS WE REPORTED
EARLIER, THE IRI WAS ONCE PART OF THE PATRIOTIC CIVIL DEFENSE IN SAN
SALVADOR, WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN DISBANDED.  WE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT HE
WAS ABOUT TO ENTER A SHOP WHEN HE WAS SHOT AT FIVE TIMES AT LEAST; WE
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT ONLY THREE BULLETS ACTUALLY STRUCK HIM.
ONE HIT HIM IN THE BACK, ANOTHER IN THE ABDOMINAL REGION, AND ONE IN
THE THROAT -- A TOTAL OF THREE BULLETS HIT HIM.  FOLLOWING AN
OPERATION, DOCTORS EXPECT HIM TO LIVE; HOWEVER, THUS FAR NO DETAILED
MEDICAL REPORT HAS BEEN ISSUED.

   HAMBURG (WEST GERMANY), 20 JUL 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] TELEVISION
STATION AND AT LEAST ONE RADIO STATION, SPOKESMEN OF TELEVISION
CHANNEL 7 -- WHICH WAS THE TELEVISION STATION AFFECTED BY THE BLAST --
TOLD DPA.
    
   ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, THE BOMB WAS SET OFF ON ALUX
MOUNTAIN, APPROXIMATELY 20 KM WEST OF THE GUATEMALAN CAPITAL.  MOST
RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS HAVE TRANSMISSION TOWERS ON THAT
MOUNTAIN BECAUSE IT TOWERS OVER A VAST AREA OF GUATEMALA.

   IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT A MAN, WHO IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE
WATCHMAN AT CHANNEL 7'S TOWER, WAS KILLED BY THE BOMB.  THE SPOKESMEN [FOR
CHANNEL 7] SAID THAT RESCUE UNITS SENT TO THE SITE HAVE YET TO RETURN TO
THE CAPITAL.

   THE EXPLOSION WAS FELT IN SEVERAL NEARBY COMMUNITIES AND IN A SECTOR OF
GUATEMALA CITY.  CHANNEL 7 SUDDENLY WENT OFF THE AIR JUST AS GUATEMALAN
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO WAS ABOUT TO DELIVER A SPEECH.
NEVERTHELESS, THE SPEECH WAS BROADCAST BY THE OTHER FOUR TELEVISION CHANNELS
THAT OPERATE IN GUATEMALA.  

   THIS TERRORIST ACTION COMES IN THE WAKE OF A SERIES OF INCIDENTS THAT
HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS AS A RESULT OF STRIKES BY TEACHERS, POST
OFFICE WORKERS, FINANCE MINISTRY EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER SECTORS DEMANDING WAGE
INCREASES.

   A BOMB WAS FOUND BEFORE IT EXPLODED IN A BANK IN THE AFTERNOON OF 19
JULY, AND SEVERAL ANONYMOUS CALLERS WARNED ABOUT OTHER TERRORIST BOMBS LAST
NIGHT; HOWEVER, THESE TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE ALARMS.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 20 JUL 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] WITH SIMULTANEOUS BOMB
EXPLOSIONS IN THE HONDURAN CAPITAL AND LA CEIBA PORT, LOCATED
APPROXIMATELY 355 KM FROM TEGUCIGALPA ON THE ATLANTIC COAST, A NEW
GUERRILLA GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE "9 MAY" PEOPLE'S LIBERATION FORCES,
FPL, ANNOUNCED ITS EMERGENCE AS ONE OF THE ARMED ORGANIZATIONS STRUGGLING
FOR POWER.

   THREE BOMBS WENT OFF SIMULTANEOUSLY IN TEGUCIGALPA, ONE AT THE CENTRAL
PARK, ANOTHER AT THE STATE-RUN UNIVERSITY OF HONDURAS, AND ANOTHER AT A
TRAINING SCHOOL FOR TEACHERS.  AT THE SAME TIME, A BOMB EXPLODED AT A
UNIVERSITY BRANCH IN LA CEIBA.  

   ALL THE BLASTS OCCURRED AT 1130 (LOCAL TIME).  ONLY ONE PERSON WHO
HAPPENED TO BE PASSING BY THE CENTRAL PARK IN TEGUCIGALPA AT THE TIME OF THE
EXPLOSION WAS WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE BLASTS.  A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE
NEW GROUP POINTS OUT THAT "ONE DOES NOT WEEP FOR MARTYRS, BUT AVENGES THEM"
AND ADDS THAT "TRAITOR INDIANS COME BEFORE THE INVADING GRINGOS."

   THE PROCLAMATION CRITICIZES THE MURDER OF POPULAR LEADERS THAT TOOK PLACE
IN THE COUNTRY IN EARLY JULY AND DENOUNCES OTHER LEFTIST LABOR AND GUERRILLA
ORGANIZATIONS.

   THE ARMED FORCES, THROUGH ITS COMMANDER, GENERAL HUMBERTO REGALADO
HERNANDEZ, RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY BY STATING THAT "THE ONLY REAL COMMUNISTS
LEFT IN THE WORLD ARE HONDURANS, BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGING IN OTHER
COUNTRIES" AND ARE NO LONGER EXPLODING BOMBS.  

   THE MILITARY LEADER ASKED PEOPLE TO ATTACH NO SIGNIFICANCE TO THE
INCIDENT AND SAID THAT SHOULD THE WAVE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE CONTINUE,
LEFTIST GROUPS WOULD HAVE TO BE CALLED TO A DIALOGUE TO AVOID OTHER SIMILAR
ACTIONS.

   THE "9 MAY" FPL PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF SAN PEDRO
SULA, 255 KM FROM TEGUCIGALPA.

   SAN PEDRO SULA, 20 JUL 89 (TIEMPO) -- [TEXT] TEGUCIGALPA -- THE
PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS COORDINATING COMMITTEE (CCOP) AND THE UNITED
FEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS (FUTH) CHARGED YESTERDAY THAT THERE IS
A TERRORIST PLAN TO ELIMINATE EVERYONE WHO OPPOSES THE U.S. MILITARY
OCCUPATION OF THE COUNTRY.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE LEADERS OF THE ORGANIZATIONS SAID THAT THE
DEATH THREATS AGAINST LABOR AND THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS
PLAN, WHICH FORMS PART OF THE U.S. POLICY ON HONDURAS.  

   REFERRING TO THE RECENT ASSASSINATIONS IN SAN PEDRO SULA, CCOP
COORDINATOR JUAN ALMENDARES BONILLA SAID THAT HONDURAS "IS AN OCCUPIED
COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS A U.S.-SPONSORED POLICY OF TERROR THAT SEEKS TO
ANNIHILATE ALL THE GROUPS THAT PROTEST THE VIOLATION OF NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY."

   HE EXPLAINED THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS FORMS OF TERROR.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE
SAID ARMED GROUPS ARRIVE AT HOUSES AT NIGHT AND RAPE ENTIRE FAMILIES.
"THESE POLICIES OF TERROR HAVE BEEN USED IN BRAZIL, CHILE, VIETNAM, EL
SALVADOR, AND GUATEMALA, AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES," HE SAID.  

   THE FORMER UNIVERSITY RECTOR SAID THAT THIS POLICY OF TERROR, WHICH HAS
RECENTLY BEEN INTENSIFIED, TRIES TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A
SUBVERSIVE CELL THAT IS DESTABILIZING THE COUNTRY PRIOR TO THE HOLDING OF
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN TELA, ATLANTIDA DEPARTMENT.

   THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS SAID THAT "THE TERRORISM OF THE HONDURAN DEMOCRATIC
STATE IS ALSO SHOWN BY AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT IS EXTENSIVELY CONTROLLED
BY THE AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE EXECUTION OF POOR
HONDURANS BY REPRESSIVE FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY U.S. EXPERTS."

   THEY SAID THE TERRORISM IS ALSO DEMOSTRATED IN THE NONFULFILLMENT OF THE
ESQUIPULAS II PEACE AGREEMENTS, BY A POLICY THAT CAPITULATES TO THE IMF AND
THE WORLD BANK, THE MAINTENANCE OF EXTREME SECURITY, AND THE FACILITIES
GIVEN TO THE THE CONTRAS AND THE U.S. ARMY.

   AFTER MAKING THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS, THE FUTH AND THE CCOP ASKED THE
GOVERNMENT TO HALT STATE TERRORISM AND TO BRING TO JUSTICE THOSE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE POLITICAL CRIMES AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS.  THEY ALSO DEMANDED
THAT THE PEACE AGREEMENTS BE RESPECTED, THAT THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
COMMISSION'S REPORT ON REPRESSION BE MADE KNOWN, AND THAT THE NICARAGUAN
CONTRAS BE DEMOBILIZED.

   THEY ALSO PROPOSED THAT THE STATE CARRY OUT A REAL POLICY OF
DEMOCRATIZATION WITH THE PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE FACE OF PRESSURE FROM
THE IMF, THE WORLD BANK, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY.

   THEY ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT ADOPT A PATRIOTIC POSITION SO THAT
THE U.S. BASES AND THE CONTRAS WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM HONDURAS BECAUSE THEY
CONSTITUTE A THREAT TO PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   THE CCOP AND THE FUTH ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAVE SCHEDULED "A GREAT
MARCH FOR NATIONAL DIGNITY" THIS AFTERNOON TO MARK THE HEROIC DEEDS OF
LEMPIRA, THE DEFENDER OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND DIGNITY.

   THE MARCH WILL BEGIN AT 1600 AT THE COMAYAGUELA OBELISK AND END AT
TEGUCIGALPA'S MAIN SQUARE.

   THE DEMONSTRATION WILL ALSO DEMAND THE REJECTION OF THE IMF AND WORLD
BANK'S PROPOSALS, THE EXPULSION OF THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AND RESPECT FOR
THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS.

   BOGOTA, 20 JUL 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THAT THE
ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION-CAMILIST UNION (UC-ELN) TODAY CARRIED OUT ITS
SIXTH ATTACK THIS YEAR AGAINST THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE, WHICH LINKS THE
COLOMBIAN TOWNS OF ORITO AND TUMACO NEAR THE COLOMBIAN-ECUADORAN BORDER.  

   THE REBELS USED EXPLOSIVES TO BLOW UP 1 METER OF PIPELINE. THIS IS THE
REBELS' 33D ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S OIL NETWORK IN 1989.  THE
AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO OIL SPILL BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF THE
ATTACK, NO OIL WAS BEING PUMPED THROUGH THE PIPELINE.

   A WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WAS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UC-ELN CALLED THE CALI
MEDIA TO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.

   THE UC-ELN IS ATTACKING COLOMBIA'S OIL PIPELINES AS A WAY TO PRESSURE THE
GOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THE OIL INDUSTRY AND TO SIGN MORE FAVORABLE
CONTRACTS WITH MULTINATIONAL OIL COMPANIES. THIS YEAR ALONE, THE UC-ELN
LAUNCHED 25 ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE, THE LONGEST IN
COLOMBIA. THE ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON- COVENAS PIPELINE HAVE CAUSED
APPROXIMATE $150 MILLION IN DAMAGE.

   IF THE SIX ATTACKS ON THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE AND THE TWO ON THE
DINA-SALGAR OIL PIPELINE ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, LOSSES AMOUNT TO
APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. THE DINA-SALGAR PIPELINE CARRIES CRUDE OIL FROM
THE OIL FIELDS IN TOLIMA TO THE REFINERY IN BARRANCABERMEJA.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 JUL 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PEOPLE: I ADDRESS YOU
ON THIS OCCASION TO GIVE YOU MY FIRST REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE
COUNTRY.  I MAKE THIS REPORT 50 DAYS AFTER ASSUMING POWER.  AT THIS
TIME I WANT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH; I WANT TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT OUR
SITUATION IS SO THAT WE WILL ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MUST DO IN THE
FUTURE.  EVERY SALVADORAN MUST SHARE IN THE SACRIFICE AND EFFORT.
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE A BIT MUST SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE
NOTHING OR VERY LITTLE.

   THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL, BUT WE MUST CONFRONT IT.  THAT IS WHY WE HAVE
A GOVERNMENT:  TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DO THIS RESPONSIBLY,
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT DOING NOTHING WOULD MEAN A GREATER CRISIS FOR THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND WOULD SINK OUR HOMELAND EVEN DEEPER IN THE BLACK ABYSS.

   WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS; WE HAVE HEARD DIFFERENT GROUPS
ASKING THAT THE GOVERNMENT STATE WHAT IT IS PLANNING TO DO TO SOLVE THE
PROBLEMS.  I WOULD LIKE TO STATE, HOWEVER, THAT WE PREFER TO ACT CALMLY,
STUDY THE PROBLEM IN DEPTH, AND FIND A SOLUTION THAT WILL TRULY SOLVE THE
PROBLEM.  WE WOULD RATHER DO THIS THAN MAKE A RASH DECISION AND MAKE A
MISTAKE.  THIS IS A TRULY DIFFICULT TASK.

   BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU IN ALL HONESTY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE
COUNTRY, I WISH TO TOUCH ON THE THREE MAJOR AREAS THAT CREATE CONCERN AND
THAT I FEEL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.  

   FIRST, LET US TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT WAS SWORN AND
INDISCRIMINATE MURDERS.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE WE
EXPRESSED OUR RESOLVE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO
THE CONFLICT.  THE FMLN'S RESPONSE, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN MORE VIOLENCE.

   WE KNOW MANY GROUPS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AND INSECURITY; THEY HAVE
EVERY REASON TO COMPLAIN.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO DO ALL THEY CAN
TO PROTECT EVERYONE.  THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS IN THE PAST DAYS, ESPECIALLY
IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS HAVE BEEN STRONGER.  THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED MANY TIMES AND BY MANY GROUPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE
GROUPS THAT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SHARE THE FMLN'S IDEAS.  THEY CLAIM THAT
THE ARMED FORCES ACT IN A REPRESSIVE MANNER.  DEAR SALVADORAN PEOPLE, LET US
ANALYZE WHAT REALLY IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY.

   THE ARMED FORCES' DUTY IS TO CONTROL ALL THOSE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE
LAW IS BROKEN.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING PUBLIC
ORDER.  THE ARMED FORCES ONLY TAKE ACTION WHEN THERE ARE GROUPS THAT ONLY
CREATE VIOLENCE AND DISRUPT PUBLIC ORDER.  THE ARMED FORCES DO NOT TAKE
ACTION JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE ACTION.  WE HAVE AN ARMED FORCES TO
DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NEVER TO ATTACK THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
THEREFORE, WHAT WE MUST DO IS LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHO IS REFUSING TO MAKE A
COMMITMENT AND WHO IS REFUSING TO SIT DOWN, IN A RATIONAL AND PEACEFUL
MANNER, TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT THAT NO LONGER HAS A PLACE IN
OUR HISTORY.  THEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT WHAT WE, AS A GOVERNMENT,
SAID ON 1 JUNE.  ON THAT DAY WE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND
TALK.  I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS A BIT, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN
MISUNDERSTANDINGS OVER OUR INTENTIONS IN THIS DIALOGUE. [CONTINUED]

  
DEV-MUC3-0308 (INTEL TEXT PROC)

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [CRISTIANI]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] SMUGGLING CAN BE HELD IN CHECK ONLY WITH MEASURES
SUCH AS THESE.  WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO TAKE THE SEVEREST ACTIONS
AGAINST THOSE WHO SMUGGLE MERCHANDISE INTO OUR COUNTRY.  AN
INVESTIGATION IS WELL UNDER WAY INTO A CORPORATION WHICH HAS BEEN
SMUGGLING MERCHANDISE INTO OUR COUNTRY.  THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
WILL SOON BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW.  WE WANT TO
WARN ALL THOSE WHO SOMEHOW HAVE SMUGGLED OR WHO ARE PLANNING TO
SMUGGLE THAT THEY SHOULD STOP THIS ACTIVITY.  WE BELIEVE THAT
SMUGGLING CONSTITUTES CORRUPTION AND THAT CORRUPTION IS A CRIME OF
HIGH TREASON.  WE CANNOT ALLOW CORRUPTION IN OUR COUNTRY.  WE WILL
TAKE HARSH ACTIONS AGAINST EVERY TYPE OF CORRUPTION, INCLUDING
SMUGGLING.  I AM ASKING THOSE WHO MIGHT BE APPROACHED BY UNSCRUPULOUS
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE IN THEIR POSSESSION SMUGGLED GOODS TO REFRAIN
FROM PURCHASING THOSE PRODUCTS.  LET US NOT PROMOTE SMUGGLING.  I AM
ASKING ALL GOOD SALVADORAN BUSINESSMEN NOT TO PURCHASE ANY SMUGGLED
GOODS.  SMUGGLING CONSTITUTES AN ATTACK AGAINST OUR HOMELAND AND
ENCOURAGES CORRUPTION, WHICH MUST BE ERADICATED FROM OUR COUNTRY.

   REGARDING OUR FISCAL POLICY, WE MUST TRY TO DETERMINE WAYS TO MORE
DIRECTLY MAKE UP FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REVENUE AND DISBURSEMENTS IN THE
COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BRIDGE THIS FISCAL DEFICIT IN TWO WAYS --
WE MUST EITHER INCREASE OUR REVENUE OR LOWER OUR DISBURSEMENTS.  THIS
GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY TAKEN AUSTERITY MEASURES REGARDING THE LATTER.  THE
GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO MAINTAIN EXPENDITURES AT THE CURRENT
LEVEL, BUT TO REDUCE THEM BY 15 PERCENT.  WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR
GOVERNMENT'S AUSTERITY MEASURES MUST BE GENUINE AND SHOULD BE AIMED AT
MAKING MORE EFFICIENT USE OF SCANT RESOURCES.  THIS IS WHY WE ARE ASKING
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO BE MORE
EFFICIENT, THE GOVERNMENT MUST PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES FOR THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.  AFTER ALL, IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO PAY OUR SALARIES AND PROVIDE THE
REVENUE THAT ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE.

   WE MUST SPEND OUR MONEY WISELY.  ALL PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES MUST
GUARD AGAINST CORRUPTION.  WE MUST TAKE PAINS TO SERVE THE POPULATION AND TO
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES THAT THE PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING AND
DESERVE.  ONLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS RUN EFFICIENTLY, WHEN ITS ACTIONS ARE
CRYSTAL CLEAR, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT RIDS ITSELF OF CORRUPTION, AND WHEN THE
MONEY THAT THE TAXPAYERS PAY IS USED FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE, WILL WE BE
ABLE TO ELICIT A POSITIVE REACTION FROM THE TAXPAYERS.  THEY HAVE TO PAY
TAXES.  WHEN TAXES ARE SQUANDERED, MISUSED, OR STOLEN, NO ONE WILL PAY THEM
WILLINGLY.  IF WE, AS THE GOVERNMENT, ACT HONESTLY, SERVE THE NATION WELL,
AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO BENEFIT THE MAJORITY, ONLY DISLOYAL SALVADORANS
WILL BE UNWILLING TO PAY TAXES.  [CONTINUED]

SECOND, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HEALTH.  WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE VERY
SHORT TERM, WE HAD TO SUPPLY ALL THE HEALTH FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS
WITH AT LEAST THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES FOR THE PEOPLE.  WE
HAVE ALLOTTED 17 MILLION COLONS FOR THE HEALTH MINISTRY FOR THE
PURCHASE OF THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES AND FOR THE
DISTRIBUTION OF THIS MEDICINE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SO THAT THE POOR
WILL RECEIVE THE EFFICIENT HEALTH SERVICES THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST
PROVIDE.

   THE EDUCATION MINISTRY HAS BEEN ASKED TO GIVE STUDENTS THE MATERIALS THEY
NEED TO PURSUE THEIR STUDIES.  A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY HAS BEEN ALLOTTED
FOR THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT NEEDED BY THE SCHOOLS.  WHEN THE 1990 SCHOOL
YEAR BEGINS, WE MUST BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS WITH
THE MATERIAL THEY NEED.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO BEGIN, AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE, REPAIRING THE STREETS AND ROADS.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
CAN SEE THAT THIS IS ALREADY BEING DONE.

   FINALLY, LOW-INCOME HOUSING.  NEXT WEEK THE PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER WILL
ANNOUNCE THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING PLAN, AND HE WILL EXPLAIN HOW WE WILL HELP
LOW-INCOME FAMILIES BUY HOMES.  THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH A SUBSIDY PLAN
ENSURING THAT LOW-INCOME GROUPS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY STEEP PAYMENTS AND
WILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR FOOD AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES.

   WE HAVE ALREADY DRAFTED A SOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN.  THIS PLAN WILL BE
IMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER, AND ITS FIRST PHASE WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN THE
HIGHLY POPULATED URBAN AREAS.  THE PLAN WILL BENEFIT APPROXIMATELY 200
COMMUNITIES AND, AS OF NOW, I ASK THE MAYORS FOR THEIR HELP, BECAUSE WE WANT
TO WORK WITH THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS.  THIS FIRST PHASE WILL BE AIMED AT
PROVIDING LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH PUBLIC UTILITIES.  WE WILL PROVIDE
THEM WITH ELECTRICITY AND RUNNING WATER, WE WILL BUILD SEWER SYSTEMS, AND WE
WILL HELP THEM IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND NUTRITION.  AMID THE CRISIS WE ARE
EXPERIENCING, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE SMALL - SCALE
BUSINESSMEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES.  WE WILL ORGANIZE A LOAN SYSTEM FOR SMALL
- SIZE BUSINESSES FOR DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES.  I REPEAT:  THIS
SOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER.  IN THE NEXT FEW
WEEKS, WE WILL BEGIN TO SEEK THE COOPERATION OF THOSE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS
THAT WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PLAN.

   THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE MUST ALL STRUGGLE FOR, AND THAT IS TO
ABOLISH UNEMPLOYMENT.  WE MUST STRUGGLE SO THAT EVERY SALVADORAN WILL HAVE
THE CHANCE TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING.  WE THEREFORE WISH TO LAUNCH AN
OFFENSIVE AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT
VIOLENCE IS THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT
FIND THEMSELVES IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY MUST COMMIT
CRIMES TO SURVIVE OR THAT THEY MUST GET INVOLVED IN THE TYPE OF VIOLENCE
SPONSORED BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  THEREFORE, IN SEPTEMBER, WE WILL ALSO
IMPLEMENT AN EMERGENCY PLAN TO GENERATE EMPLOYMENT.  THIS PLAN HAS SOME
SPECIFIC GOALS:  FIRST, TO PROVIDE A BASIC JOB FOR THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE
UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED.  OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE 20,000 JOBS PER MONTH
FOR THESE PEOPLE.  THIS PLAN WILL BE DRAFTED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, AND WE
WILL IMPLEMENT IT DURING THOSE MONTHS WHEN THERE IS USUALLY A DROP IN
EMPLOYMENT.  I MUST STRESS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN
DURING THE SOWING AND HARVEST SEASONS, BECAUSE DURING THOSE SEASONS THERE IS
AN OVERABUNDANCE OF JOBS. [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 22 JUL 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE, COPREFA] [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THIS MORNING THAT UNIDENTIFIED MEN
SET OFF BOMBS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN JOSE SIMEON CANAS UNIVERSITY,
UCA, LOCATED IN SOUTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT 0200.  ONE
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE, ONE BUS, AND ONE ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMER WERE DAMAGED
AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION OF AT LEAST FOUR BOMBS THAT WENT OFF INSIDE THE
UCA CAMPUS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS CONDEMNED THIS KIND OF ATTACK, WHICH IS
USUALLY CARRIED OUT BY CERTAIN GROUPS THAT OPPOSE PEACE. THE ARMED FORCES
BELIEVE THAT SUCH ATTACKS ARE NOT THE WAY TO SOLVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND
POLITICAL PROBLEMS.

   IN ADDITION, THESE VIOLENT ACTIONS ONLY CONFUSE THE PUBLIC, BECAUSE
UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE ALWAYS BLAME THE ARMY FOR ANY SUCH ACTION, WITHOUT FIRST
CONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF THE ORIGIN OF THE ATTACKS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS REITERATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENSURE
RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE LIFE AND
SAFETY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, FROM THIS VERY MOMENT, THE
ARMED FORCES REJECT ANY ACCUSATION IMPLICATING THEM IN THE ATTACK AGAINST
UCA, WHICH TOOK PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING.

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 JUL 89 (LA PRENSA GRAFICA) -- [SPEECH] [SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] DEAR PEASANT FRIENDS:

   FROM THE VERY 1ST DAY OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE PLEDGED OUR FULL
COMMITMENT TO NATIONAL PROGRAMS AND HAVE SAID THAT "AT NO TIME AND FOR NO
REASON WILL WE FORGET THE MANY NEEDY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY -- THAT IS, THE
NOBLE AND LONG-SUFFERING PEASANTS, WHO ARE THE MAIN VICTIMS OF TERRORIST
VIOLENCE."  

   THIS CEREMONY REAFFIRMS OUR GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE AGRARIAN
REFORM.

   WE WANT YOU TO REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF OUR WORDS THROUGH OUR DEEDS.
THIS PRESENTATION OF 8,000 PERMANENT LAND TITLE DEEDS TO THE BENEFICIARIES
OF DECREE 207 -- THROUGH THE NATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FOR AGRICULTURAL
LANDS (FINATA) -- REFLECTS OUR OBJECTIVES.

   WE HAVE CATEGORICALLY SAID THAT WE WILL NOT TURN BACK THE AGRARIAN REFORM
PROCESS.  QUITE TO THE CONTRARY, WE WANT TO FULLY SUPPORT IT IN ORDER TO
GUARANTEE THAT PEASANTS IN AREAS AFFECTED BY THE AGRARIAN REFORM ARE FREE TO
CHOOSE THE KIND OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP THAT BEST SUITS THEIR NEEDS, IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE GREAT FREEDOMS GUARANTEED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS
OF THE REPUBLIC.

   OUR GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK HARD TO ENSURE THAT OUR BROTHER
PEASANTS ARE INDEED BENEFITED BY THE AGRARIAN REFORM AND THAT THEY WILL NOT
BE USED AS A DEMAGOGICAL BANNER AT THE SERVICE OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, AS WAS
THE CASE UNTIL RECENTLY.  WE WANT PEASANTS' WELFARE TO BE THE OBJECTIVE OF
OUR AGRARIAN REFORM; WE WANT AGRARIAN REFORM TO DEVELOP WITHIN A LEGAL,
HONEST, AND PATRIOTIC FRAMEWORK.

   WE ARE AGAINST THE DEMAGOGUERY OF STATIC PATERNALISM, BECAUSE WE WANT
PEASANTS TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN FATE, TO TRULY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR
PRODUCTION UNITS' DECISIONMAKING PROCESS, IN THE MARKETING OF THEIR
PRODUCTS, AND IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE.

   IT IS NEITHER FAIR NOR CORRECT, AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST, TO
BENEFIT OFFICE WORKERS, WHO HAVE NEVER SWEATED IN THE FIELDS UNDER THE
AGRARIAN REFORM, WHEN YOU -- THE PEASANTS -- ARE NOW FACING DEBTS AND ARE
WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE YOU OWNED LAND.

   OUR GOVERNMENT AND YOU WILL GRADUALLY CHANGE THIS SITUATION TO ENSURE
THAT YOU WILL ENTHUSIASTICALLY WORK YOUR LAND, KNOWING THAT THE FRUIT OF
YOUR LABOR WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT YOUR FAMILIES.  WE ARE SURE THAT WITH
EFFICIENT ORGANIZATION, PROMPT CREDIT, ADEQUATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND
THE HARDWORKING LEGACY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE WILL TURN THE AGRARIAN
REFORM INTO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WILL
BENEFIT ALL SALVADORANS BY PROMOTING PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY.

   DEAR PEASANTS:

   WE WISH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TELL YOU THAT OUR
GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK WITH YOU.  THROUGH THE RELEVANT
ORGANIZATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT WILL IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO COMPLETELY UPGRADE
THE SALVADORAN PEASANTS' CONDITIONS.  

   THROUGH FINATA, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF MORE LAND
FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THOUSANDS OF PEASANT FAMILIES.

   DEAR FRIENDS:

   OUR GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE PEACE, BECAUSE WE ARE AWARE THAT
THE FMLN'S TERRORIST VIOLENCE DISTURBS THE CALM AND NORMAL PROCEDURE OF
RURAL ACTIVITIES; WE REALIZE THAT WE MUST END THE VIOLENCE SO THAT WE CAN
ALL GO BACK TO WORK AND BRING ABOUT A NATIONAL RECOVERY.  PEASANTS HAVE
SUFFERED THE MOST THROUGHOUT THE CONFLICT UNLEASHED BY THE TERRORIST
MARXIST-LENINIST GROUPS, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO SEEK THE
PEACE THAT WE ALL WANT IN ORDER TO RESTORE SOCIAL HARMONY, MUTUAL RESPECT,
AND FRATERNAL LOVE AMONG ALL SALVADORANS WITHOUT EXCEPTION.  

   ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC, WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY
PLEASED TO PRESENT THESE PERMANENT LAND TITLE DEEDS TO THE BENEFICIARIES OF
DECREE 207.  WE CONGRATULATE AND INVITE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER TO
HELP THE FATHERLAND RECOVER FROM THE CRISIS AND TO BUILD FOR OUR CHILDREN
AND ALL SALVADORANS A FUTURE OF PEACE, JUSTICE, LIBERTY, AND PROGRESS.

   LIMA, 28 JUL 89 -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] LIMA TELEVISION PERUANA
NETWORK IN SPANISH 1733 GMT ON 28 JULY, CONTINUING ITS LIVE COVERAGE
OF FESTIVITIES ON THE OCCASION OF PERUVIAN NATIONAL DAY, BROADCASTS A
SPEECH TO THE NATION BY PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA LIVE FROM THE
NATIONAL CONGRESS CHAMBER IN LIMA.

   PRESIDENT GARCIA NOTES THAT HIS PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN A TESTIMONY OF FAITH
TO DEMOCRACY BASED ON THE PERUVIAN CONSTITUTION, WHICH PROVIDES THE
FRAMEWORK FOR GOVERNING A FREE PERU.  NOTING THAT THIS SPEECH IS HIS LAST
MESSAGE TO THE COUNTRY FROM CONGRESS, GARCIA BEGINS TO COMMENT ON THE
ACHIEVEMENTS AND EVENTS OF HIS LAST YEAR IN OFFICE.  AFTER STRESSING THE
IMPORTANCE OF DEMOCRACY AND EDUCATION TO OVERCOME PROBLEMS OF THE ECONOMY
AND OF VIOLENCE, GARCIA DECLARES:  "I AM HEREBY CALL FOR GENERAL ELECTIONS
TO CHOOSE PRESIDENT AND THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON 8 APRIL 1990.  APPLAUSE

   "I WOULD LIKE TO REMARK THAT I AM A POLITICIAN, THAT I PARTICIPATE IN
DEBATES, AND THAT MY LIFE IS INDEBTED TO THE APRA [AMERICAN POPULAR
REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] MOVEMENT.  YET AS PRESIDENT I HAVE A MAJOR SACRED
MISSION, THAT OF GUARANTEEING THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE ABSOLUTELY FAIR
AND CLEAN."

   GARCIA NOTES THAT THE ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE REPLACED AND THAT THE
NATIONAL MEDIA ARE FROM THIS MOMENT ON PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE
CANDIDATES.  HE CALLS ON THE ARMED FORCES TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.

   THE PRESIDENT CALLS ON PERUVIAN YOUTH TO ESCHEW VIOLENCE IN FAVOR OF
EDUCATION AND WORKING TOWARD PROMOTING DEMOCRACY.

   GARCIA THEN TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO THE QUESTION OF REGIONALIZATION,
NOTING THAT MANY GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS ARE BEING REORGANIZED TO BETTER
SERVE THE PEOPLE.  WHEN EACH REGION HAS ITS OWN ELECTED OFFICIALS, HE SAYS,
THE PEOPLE WILL EXERT MORE CONTROL OVER OFFICIALS' ACTIVITIES, AND
CORRUPTION WILL BE REDUCED.  PERU WILL NOT NEED TO ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL
SOLUTIONS TO ITS NATIONAL PROBLEMS.

   AFTER CALLING ON THE JUSTICE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO IMPROVE ITS
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, GARCIA ANNOUNCES: "I HEREBY CALL ELECTIONS --
FOLLOWING A CONSULTATION WITH THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COURT -- FOR REGIONAL
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GRAU REGION, CREATED ON 1 MARCH 1988, MADE
UP OF THE FOLLOWING PROVINCES: TUMBES, CONTRALMIRANTE VILLAR, ZARUMILLA,
HUANCABAMBA, MORROPON, PAITA, SULLANA, TALARA, AYABACA, AND PIURA ON 12
NOVEMBER 1989."  GARCIA ALSO ISSUES AN OFFICIAL CALL FOR 12 NOVEMBER
ELECTIONS IN THE AMAZONAS, AREQUIPA, AND MOQUEGUA-TACNA-PUNO REGIONS.

   AT 1801 GMT GARCIA BEGINS TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT OF TERRORISM AND
VIOLENCE.  HE CALLS ON THE PEOPLE AS WELL AS ALL POLTIICAL PARTIES TO
SUPPORT THE ARMED FORCES IN PUTTING AN END TO VIOLENCE.  HE PROPOSES THAT
TERRORISTS BE TRIED IN MILITARY COURTS.  

   ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN PERU, PRESIDENT GARCIA
REITERATES THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN RESERVES
AS WELL AS REACTIVATING THE PRODUCTION SECTOR.  HE NOTES THE IMPORTANCE OF
FURTHER DEVELOPING AGRICULTURE AND PETROLEUM.  HE REVIEWS THE PUBLIC WORKS
PROJECTS, INCLUDING IRRIGATION AND RURAL ELECTRICIFICATION WORKS, THAT HAVE
BEEN INITIATED OR COMPLETED DURING HIS PRESIDENCY.

   GARCIA CALLS ON THE PEOPLE NOT TO BE DEFEATED BY TERRORISM,
SENSATIONALISM, OR PESSIMISM.  NOTING THAT THE PEOPLE ARE PERU'S MOST
IMPORTANT RESOURCE, THE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR IMPROVING THE SOCIAL WELFARE
SECTOR.  HE DENIES THE RUMOR THAT SECTOR WILL BE PRIVATIZED.

   GARCIA ENDS HIS SPEECH AT 1851 GMT.

   BUENOS AIRES, 28 JUL 89 (ARGENTINA TELEVISORA COLOR NETWORK) --
[SPEECH] [ALVARO ALSOGARAY, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER ON FOREIGN DEBT
MATTERS] [EXCERPTS] GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.  TODAY WE WILL
DISCUSS THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM.  THIS SUBJECT COULD PERHAPS SEEM A
BIT OUT PLACE AT A TIME WHEN MORE TROUBLESOME MATTERS AFFECT ALL
ARGENTINE FAMILIES, SUCH AS HIGH PUBLIC UTILITY RATES, PRICES,
CONTROLS, DIFFICULTIES, ETC.  HOWEVER, WE MUST ATTEND TO THE FOREIGN
DEBT PROBLEM BECAUSE MOST OUR DIFFICULTIES COME FROM IT.

   OF WHAT DOES THIS PROBLEM CONSIST?  WE CURRENTLY OWE $64 BILLION.  THIS
REPRESENTS A BURDEN OF $6 BILLION YEARLY IN INTEREST PAYMENTS.  SINCE
ARGENTINA IS CURRENTLY EXPORTING $9 BILLION ANNUALLY, AND IF WE PAID $6
BILLION IN INTEREST, WE WOULD ONLY HAVE $3 BILLION LEFT ANNUALLY TO ATTEND
TO ALL OUR NATIONAL NEEDS, THAT IS, THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY, COMMERCE, ETC.

   OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY, AND WE CANNOT PAY $6 BILLION IN
INTEREST EACH YEAR WITH $9 BILLION WORTH OF ANNUAL EXPORTS.

   THIS IS NOT NEW.  THIS IS A HEAVY INHERITANCE, WHICH ORIGINATED NOT IN
THE RECENT PAST BUT MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO.  WHEN MARTINEZ DE HOZ BECAME
ECONOMY MINISTER [MARCH 1976], THE FOREIGN DEBT AMOUNTED TO $9 BILLION.
WHEN HE CONCLUDED HIS TERM, THE DEBT AMOUNTED TO $29 BILLION.  THE
MILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT CAME AFTER HIM DRAGGED THE DEBT ALONG AND
INCREASED IT TO $44 BILLION WHICH THEY PASSED TO PRESIDENT ALFONSIN.
ALFONSIN'S ADMINISTRATION INCREASED THE DEBT BY AN ADDITIONAL $20 BILLION.
SO TODAY OUR DEBT AMOUNTS TO $64 BILLION.

   THIS IS NOT ALL.  WE CEASED HONORING OUR COMMITMENTS ABROAD.  WE HAVE NOT
EVEN PAID INTEREST SINCE APRIL LAST YEAR.  WE HAVE ONLY MADE TOKEN
PAYMENTS.  THIS REFUTES THE IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SAY: LET US STOP PAYING OUR
DEBT AND USE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GROW.  WE ARE NOT PAYING
ANYTHING.

   FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ANYTHING, AND NOT ONLY HAS
THE ECONOMY NOT GROWN, BUT IT SHRANK.

   ARGENTINA HAS AN EXTREMELY LOW CREDIT RATING.  COUNTRIES ARE
INTERNATIONALLY CLASSIFIED BY THEIR CREDIT, AND WE ARE IN ONE OF THE LOWEST
CATEGORIES.  OUR COMMERCIAL CREDIT IS ALSO BEING CURTAILED.  COMMERCIAL
CREDITS ARE THE ONES THAT ALLOW US TO IMPORT, EXPORT, AND MEET OUR DAILY
NEEDS.

   WHEN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ASSUMED POWER ON 8 APRIL 1989, THE CENTRAL
BANK'S FOREIGN RESERVES WERE EXHAUSTED.  THIS SITUATION CAN TURN INTO A
CRISIS AT ANY MOMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE LIKE THIS.

   THE COMING OF THIS NEW GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BROUGHT ABOUT POSITIVE
EXPECTATIONS AND HOPE, AND WHICH IS UNDERTAKING REMARKABLE CHANGES -- MAINLY
CHANGES OF MENTALITY -- HAS STOPPED THE CRISIS FROM EXPLODING.  BUT WE
CANNOT REST ON OUR ACHIEVEMENTS.  WE MUST FACE THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY.

   OUR STARTING POINT IN CERTAINLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.  OUR COUNTRY HAS NO
PRESTIGE ABROAD; WE HAVE LOST OUR CREDIBILITY.  NO ONE EVEN WANTS TO HEAR
ABOUT ARGENTINA, OR AT LEAST ABOUT ITS DEBT.  IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE
NOT HONORED ANY OF OUR COMMIETMENTS.  EVERY TIME WE SIGNED A LETTER OF
INTENT WITH THE IMF, WE KNEW THAT WE COULD NOT COMPLY WITH IT.  THERE HAVE
BEEN SEVERAL LETTERS OF INTENT WE DID NOT COMPLY WITH.

   WHAT POLICY WILL WE FOLLOW IN THE FUTURE?  THE PRESIDENT DEFINED IT IN
HIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS ON 8 JULY.  HE SAID WE HAVE A HEAVY BURDEN, A DEBT
THAT WAS UNWISELY CONTRACTED, BUT IT IS A COMMITMENT OF HONOR.  HE USED
WORDS THAT WERE COMMON IN ARGENTINA IN THE PAST.  

   IT WAS ONCE SAID: WE WILL COMPLY WITH OUR COMMITMENTS, EVEN AT THE COST
OF HUNGER AND THIRST FOR THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS
OWN COMMITMENT ON THIS SUBJECT.  WE WILL PAY ACCORDING TO THE CAPABILITY OF
THE NATION, AND THE ONLY THING WE REQUIRE IS A BIT OF TIME AND, OF COURSE,
FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF OUR CREDITORS.

   IF WE DID NOT HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS, IF WE HAD SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO
PAY, THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY WORSE.  WE WOULD BE
ISOLATED.  WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CREDITS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO
OBTAIN FOREIGN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  IN A WORD, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO
INTEGRATE THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH IS QUICKLY EXPANDING AND
PROGRESSING.  WE WOULD BE MUCH MORE BACKWARD THAN WE ARE TODAY.  THEREFORE
THERE IS REALLY NO QUESTION OF PAYING OR NOT PAYING.  THE HONOR OF THE
COUNTRY IS AT STAKE.

   WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE FOREIGN DEBT IN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY?  YOU KNOW
THAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY.  WE HAVE NATURAL RESOURCES, FOOD, ENERGY,
FISHING, MINING, ETC.  WE HAVE HUMAN RESOURCES.  YOU KNOW THAT WHEN
ARGENTINES WORK ABROAD THEY ARE EFFICIENT AND THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH.
WE HAVE NO INTERNAL RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, OR INDIAN PROBLEMS, NOT EVEN PROBLEMS
WITH OUR NEIGHBORS.

   WHAT ARE WE MISSING?  WHY ARE WE WHERE WE ARE, AND WHY CAN'T WE SURVIVE?
WE NEED TWO THINGS: FIRST, WE NEED AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC ORDER.  WE LIVE
IN A DEEP ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISORDER.  SECOND, WE NEED CAPITAL.  CAPITAL
IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

   I SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO DISCUSS THE SAVINGS IN ARGENTINA THAT CAN BE
TAPPED.  FOR YEARS, ARGENTINA'S SAVINGS HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY PUNISHED BY
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS ABUSIVE TAXES, MANDATORY SAVINGS, AND, ABOVE
ALL, THE GREAT EROSION CAUSED BY INFLATION THAT DESTROYS THE CURRENCY.  JUST
REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE CHANGED OUR CURRENCY.  TO PROTECT THEMSELVES
FROM THESE LOSSES, WHAT DID SAVERS DO?  THEY EITHER TOOK THEIR MONEY ABROAD
OR HID IT UNDER THEIR MATTRESSES.  WE WILL FOCUS TODAY ON THE MONEY UNDER THE
MATTRESSES, ALTHOUGH WHAT I WILL SAY NOW WILL ALSO BE RELEVANT FOR THOSE WHO
HAVE THEIR SAVINGS ABROAD.  ACCORDING TO CALCULATIONS, THERE ARE SMALL,
MEDIUM, AND LARGE SAVINGS ADDING UP TO NEARLY $5 BILLION IN THE COUNTRY.  A
PERSON WAS ASSAULTED IN CORDOBA THE OTHER DAY AND $250,000 WAS FOUND IN HIS
MATTRESS.  MONEY UNDER THE MATTRESS IS AT RISK, DOES NOT ACCRUE INTEREST,
DOES NOT WORK FOR THE COUNTRY, AND DOES NOT GIVE ANY BENEFIT TO THE OWNERS
NOR THE COUNTRY.

   SOME OF OUR HOPE LIES IN THESE SAVINGS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY,
BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT A RESERVE THAT WE HAVE ON HAND.  WE ARE NOT
BANKRUPT.  WE HAVE THOSE RESERVES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT WORKING.  THE
SECRET IS TO USE THEM FOR THE COUNTRY'S BENEFIT.  ARGENTINA'S PROBLEMS CAN
BE RESOLVED IF THESE SAVINGS ARE USED.  NOW, TO TAP INTO THESE SAVINGS, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A DECISION, AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAS ALREADY TRANSLATED
IT INTO A RESOLUTION.  INTO BANKS HERE IN THE COUNTRY IN DOLLARS, YEN,
DEUTSCHE MARKS, OR ANY OTHER CURRENCY.  THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE
WITHDRAWALS WHENEVER THEY WANT IN THE SAME CURRENCY IN WHICH THEIR SAVINGS
WERE DEPOSITED.  NOBODY WILL BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THEM.  THIS WILL BE
REINFORCED BY A LAW GRANTING SAVERS THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE THAT NO PUBLIC
POWER CAN INTERVENE IN THOSE SAVINGS; THAT IS, THERE WILL BE A FINANCIAL
SYSTEM INTO WHICH THOSE SAVINGS, IN ANY CURRENCY, CAN BE PLACED FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND, OF COURSE, THE DEPOSITOR.  ANYBODY WHO HAS
$10,000 UNDER HIS MATTRESS CAN TAKE IT OUT, GO TO THE BANK, AND, UNDER THE
GUARANTEE OF THE BANK -- NOT THE CENTRAL BANK OR THE NATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN
DISCREDITED -- THE MONEY WILL BE AT HIS DISPOSAL AT ANY TIME.  THE BANK WILL
LEND THE MONEY FOR EXPORT OPERATIONS AND FOR MOVING THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH.
NEW BLOOD WILL THUS HAVE BEEN INJECTED INTO THE ARGENTINE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

   I POINT OUT THAT THE LAW WILL GIVE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES. NO PUBLIC POWER
WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEIZE THE SAVINGS, NOR FREEZE THEM, NOR POSTPONE
THEIR WITHDRAWAL.  THESE ARE THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES THAT CAN BE GIVEN; MORE
IS IMPOSSIBLE.  EACH ARGENTINE MUST NOW THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS.  IT HAS
A CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE, BECAUSE IT INJECTS BLOOD INTO THE SOCIAL BODY; IT
MOVES THE COUNTRY.  MOREOVER, FROM THE MORAL STANDPOINT, IF WE DO NOT DO
THIS, HOW CAN WE GO ABROAD AND ASK FOREIGNERS TO INVEST IN ARGENTINA -- TO
BRING THEIR MONEY TO ARGENTINA -- IF AT THE SAME TIME I DO NOT INVEST HERE
BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY COUNTRY? THIS IS AN IMMORAL POSITION.

   IF WE MAKE THE INITIAL EFFORT AND DEPOSIT $2, 3 OR 4 BILLION IN THE
COUNTRY, OUR NEGOTIATIONS ABROAD TAKE A NEW TWIST, BECAUSE WE CAN SAY THAT
THE ARGENTINES HAVE MADE THE FIRST EFFORT.  ALL THIS NATURALLY DEPENDS ON
CONFIDENCE, AND CONFIDENCE IN TURN DEPENDS ON TAKING THIS FIRST STEP.  THIS
IS A RECIPROCAL EFFECT.  TO CREATE CONFIDENCE, MEASURES SUCH AS THOSE
ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAVE TO BE ADOPTED.  THESE
MEASURES CREATE CONFIDENCE, AND WITH CONFIDENCE THE COUNTRY WILL QUICKLY
RECOVER.  WE HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS, BUT WITHIN THE
LIMITATION OF TIME, WE CAN STOP HERE.

   LIMA, 28 JUL 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA] [EXCERPTS] MR PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, GENTLEMEN
MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS:

   TEN YEARS AGO, THE MEMBERS OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY PRESIDED OVER BY
HAYA DE LA TORRE, CALLING UP ON LORD GOD FOR STRENGTH AND IN KEEPING WITH
THE POWERS VESTED IN US BY THE SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE PEOPLE, APPROVED THE
NATIONAL CONSTITUTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HUMAN BEING COMES FIRST AND THAT
ALL HONORABLE PEOPLE HAVE UNIVERSALLY VALID RIGHTS.  THUS WE DECIDED TO WORK
FOR A FREE AND JUST SOCIETY AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE
BASED ON POPULAR WILL AND ON THE FREE, PERIODIC CONSULTATION OF THIS WILL.

   WE BET ON CIVILIZED COEXISTENCE AS A WAY OF LAUNCHING A PROCESS BASED ON
STABLE AND LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITIONS, HOWEVER,
WERE SET FORTH IN CHAPTER 1, WHICH RECOGNIZED THE INDIVIDUAL'S BASIC RIGHTS
AND DUTIES FOR THE FREE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS PERSONALITY.

   OUR CONSTITUTION WAS A RESULT OF THE BALANCE ACHIEVED AMONG VARIOUS AND
SOMETIMES ANTAGONISTIC POLITICAL FORCES.  THUS, SOME OF ITS ECONOMIC
ARTICLES MAY SEEM VAGUE. HOWEVER, UNDER THIS CONSTITUTION ANY IDEOLOGY CAN
GOVERN THE COUNTRY AND MAKE CHANGES IN ANY DIRECTION WHATSOEVER, AS LONG AS
THOSE FIRST CONDITIONS AGREED UPON BY CONSENSUS ARE RESPECTED. [PASSAGE
OMITTED]

   THIS IS THE LAST MESSAGE I WILL DELIVER TO CONGRESS AS PRESIDENT BEFORE I
TURN THE PRESIDENCY OVER TO A CITIZEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.

   I CANNOT FAIL TO EXPAND ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE THIS YEAR, WHICH,
HONESTLY SPEAKING ARE MUCH FEWER THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. I AM DELIVERING A
SUMMARY OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS IN WRITING, AS ESTABLISH BY THE CONSTITUTION,
FOR THE USE OF THE LEGISLATORS. IT IS A SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENTS.

   IT IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT TO ME TO SAY THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE
GOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE TO REAFFIRM THE SYSTEM OF
DEMOCRATIC FREEDOM, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SYSTEM PERU HAS. WITH THIS
FREEDOM, EVEN THE MOST EXTREME POSITIONS CAN EXIST. THE REACTIONARY
POSITIONS OF THE ULTRARIGHT AND RADICAL IDEOLOGIES CAN ALSO LIVE IN FREEDOM.
VIOLENCE HAS LESS CHANCE OF DEVELOPING IN FREEDOM.  THE NATION HAS MORE
LEGITIMATE MEANS TO ERADICATE VIOLENCE UNDER FREEDOM.

   LIKE ANY OTHER CITIZEN, I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SOMETIMES DISAGREEMENTS,
POLITICAL PARTIES, LAWS, AND SKILLFUL LEGAL PROCEDURES CAN OBSTRUCT MANY
THINGS AND STOP DECISIONS. BUT THIS IS THE PRICE FOR A CIVILIZED LIFESTYLE.
DEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE THE FORTHRIGHTNESS OF A DICTATORSHIP. DEMOCRACY IS
SLOWER, BUT DEMANDS MORE FIRMNESS, MORE CONVICTION, MORE PATIENCE. DEMOCRACY
DEMANDS THE GRADUAL EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE; THIS TAKES A LONG TIME. I AM
SAYING THIS BECAUSE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SUFFERING A DRAMATIC ECONOMIC
CRISIS SINCE SEPTEMBER 1988, AND IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO MAKE HARSH CHANGES
AT A TIME WHEN VIOLENCE HAS SEEMED TO INCREASE.

   WE HEARD SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST THEIR COOL DEMANDING AN INTERRUPTION OF
OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY CALLED FOR A SHORTER GOVERNMENT TERM. THEY ALSO SAID
THAT THE COUNTRY COULD DEFEAT THE TERRORIST VIOLENCE AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS
BY RESTRICTING FREEDOM AND ESTABLISHING AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME.

   I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WERE IMMATURE VOICES, DECEITFUL TEMPTATIONS. MANY OF
THOSE VOICES UNFORTUNATELY CAME FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE WEALTH. BY DOING
THIS THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE NOT YET READY TO COEXIST DEMOCRATICALLY
AND TO ACCEPT THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TENSIONS, EVEN AT THE WORSE TIMES,
SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH SERENITY AND PATIENCE. A DICTATORSHIP THAT VIOLATES
LEGAL PROCEDURES WILL ONLY HELP TO INCREASE VIOLENCE AND LEGITIMATE
INSURGENCY, AND WOULD STIMULATE THE CREATION OF NEW SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. A
DICTATORSHIP CANNOT SOLVE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT WOULD ONLY HAVE LIMITED
POWER AND WOULD IMPOSE A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD LEAD NOWHERE.

   I AM REFERRING TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE A CRUCIAL
PERIOD. I CALL ON THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY
BY REALIZING THAT IN A DEMOCRACY THE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED WITH MORE
DEMOCRACY, WITH MORE FREEDOM, AND WITH MORE PARTICIPATION. TO HAVE
DEMOCRACY, ONE MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF PATIENCE.

   THIS IS MY LAST MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. I AM COMMITTED TO MORE FREEDOM AND
MORE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, WHICH SOMETIMES WE DOUBT BECAUSE OF EXCESSES.
BUT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WILL ALWAYS BE POSITIVE, BECAUSE WITHOUT FREEDOM
OF EXPRESSION ABUSE WILL PREVAIL. [CONTINUED]

AMBASSADOR AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC],
WAS THE "VICTIM OF THE POLITICAL INTOLERANCE OF GROUPS WHO DO NOT WANT
TO LIVE IN DEMOCRACY."

   IN STATEMENTS TO NEWSMEN, CEREZO SAID THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING
BARILLAS "ARE EXTREME RIGHTIST GROUPS SEEKING TO DESTABILIZE THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS BEGUN ON 14 JANUARY 1986," AFTER 2 DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES.

   POLICE SOURCES REPORTED THAT BARILLAS, AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN DURING THE
FIRST 2 YEARS OF CEREZO'S ADMINISTRATION, WHICH BEGAN IN 1986, WAS GUNNED
DOWN BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS AS HE WAS RETURNING TO HIS HOME IN THE SOUTHERN

   OFFICIAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE ATTACKERS, WHO WERE TRAVELING IN TWO
VEHICLES WITH TINTED WINDOWS, HAD BEEN WAITING FOR BARILLAS SINCE VERY EARLY
IN THE MORNING.  DE POLITICAL LEADER MANAGED TO AVOID THE FIRST SHOTS THAT
WERE FIRED AT HIM AND TOOK REFUGE UNDER A PARKED CAR, WHERE THE ASSAILANTS
PUMPED 6 ROUNDS INTO HIM.

   BARILLAS, 50, WAS SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PDC FROM 1970 TO 1974.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO AND ALFONSO CABRERA, PDC SECRETARY AND
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL FOR THAT PARTY, WENT TO BARILLAS' HOME WHERE THEY
VEHEMENTLY CONDEMNED THE CRIME.

   CABRERA TERMED THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING "COWARDS," AND SAID THAT
THE CRIME IS PART OF A TERRORIST WAVE THAT HAS GRIPPED GUATEMALA FOR OVER 15
DAYS.  

   BARILLAS WAS A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN DELEGATION THAT PARTICIPATED IN A
MEETING WITH LEADERS OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG)
HELD IN MADRID, SPAIN, IN OCTOBER 1987, WHEN HE WAS AMBASSADOR TO THAT
EUROPEAN COUNTRY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 31 JUL 89 (EL MUNDO) -- [TEXT] "I DO NOT WANT TO
INTERFERE AT ALL.  THE JUDGE WILL PRONOUNCE THE VERDICT; MEANWHILE, I
WILL WAIT AND KEEP SILENT," MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY
BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SAID YESTERDAY REGARDING HIS BROTHER SHORTLY
AFTER ENDING SUNDAY'S [30 JULY] HOMILY AT THE CATHEDRAL.

   THE PRELATE WAS REFERRING TO THE ARREST OF SALOMON ENRIQUE ROSA CHAVEZ,
WHO WAS TURNED OVER TO THE FIRST CRIMINAL COURT BY THE NATIONAL POLICE AND
ACCUSED OF BELONGING TO THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY (ERP).  THE FIRST
CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ORDERED HIS TEMPORARY ARREST FOLLOWING A 72 - HOUR
PERIOD, AS ESTABLISHED BY LAW FOR CRIMES OF BEARING COUNTERFEIT DOCUMENTS
AND FOR BRIBERY; THESE CRIMES DO NOT REQUIRE A PRISON SENTENCE.

   THE AUXILIARY BISHOP SAID:  "I HAVE REMAINED SILENT OUT OF RESPECT FOR
THE LEGAL PROCESS, WHICH IS STILL UNDER WAY.  MY BROTHER IS STILL IN PRISON,
AND THAT IS WHY I PREFER TO WAIT FOR THE PROCESS TO END," HE SAID.  THE
PRISONER WAS NOT RELEASED ON SATURDAY, BUT HE WILL BE RELASED ON MONDAY, 7
AUGUST.

   ASKED BY REPORTERS IF THE CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIS BROTHER WOULD HURT HIS
[MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ'S] IMAGE OR THAT OF THE CHURCH, HE SAID THAT THE CHURCH'S
DUTY TO THE COUNTRY IS DIFFICULT TO FULFILL BUT THAT THE CHURCH'S EFFORTS
MUST CONTINUE, BECAUSE THE HUGE NUMBER OF PARISHIONERS WHO COME TO THE
CATHEDRAL EVERY SUNDAY TO EASE THEIR PAINS CANNOT BE ABANDONED.

   "A SHEPHERD SHOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS FLOCK, AND, WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS,
WE WILL CALMLY DEAL WITH THEM, BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF OUR MISSION," HE SAID.

   THE PRELATE EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE SERIES OF CONTROVERSIES THAT
AROSE DURING THE WEEK, SUCH AS THE CHARGES AND THE COUNTERCHARGES.  HE SAID
THAT THE MOST SERIOUS THING IS THE "CASE OF MSGR ROMERO," WHOSE MEMORY
CONTINUES TO INSPIRE MANY AND IS A NIGHTMARE FOR THE MASTERMINDS AND
PERPETRATORS OF HIS ABOMINABLE ASSASSINATION.  

   THESE CHARGES WERE MADE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL BY FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE,
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION MEMBERS, AND WELL-KNOWN POLITICAL FIGURES.  ROSA
CHAVEZ REFERRED TO THE CHARGES FILED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL DR MAURICIO ERNESTO
COLORADO, WHO LAST WEEK ASKED THE FIRST TREASURY COURT JUDGE TO DRAW UP AN
INDICTMENT AGAINST JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY, AND A
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER.

   THE AUXILIARY BISHOP SAID:  "I GREATLY REGRET THE FACT THAT THIS
ATMOSPHERE IS ONE OF -- I ACCUSE YOU, YOU ACCUSE ME, AND WE ACCUSE EACH
OTHER.  THAT IS NO WAY TO MAKE PROGRESS, BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPECT THEIR LEADERS
TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE AND SERIOUS.  OTHERWISE, WHAT WILL THOSE OF US WHO
ARE UNDERLINGS LEARN?  THAT IS WHY I HAVE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR ALL OF US
TO HELP CLEAR THE AIR SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE PEACE FOR WHICH WE ALL
YEARN."

   MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ CONGRATULATED ALL JOURNALISTS IN HIS HOMILY AND SAID:
"I REMIND ALL JOURNALISTS -- AS POPE JOHN PAUL II ONCE SAID -- THAT NEWS, IF
ONE THINKS ABOUT IT, IS NEVER IMPARTIAL, BECAUSE IT AT LEAST INTENTIONALLY
AND IMPLICITLY RESPONDS TO IMPORTANT MATTERS.  JOURNALISM PROVIDES AN
INTIMATE LINK BETWEEN THE NEWS, EDUCATION, AND ESSENTIAL VALUES.  ALMOST ALL
MEN AND WOMEN WORKING FOR THE PRESS, RADIO, AND TELEVISION MEDIA MUST TRY TO
ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK.  HOWEVER, EACH DAY THEY NEED COURAGE AND MUST HAVE
MUCH LOVE FOR THIS PEOPLE, WHO HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY, SO THAT THEY WILL
REMAIN LOYAL TO THE VALUES OF THEIR PROFESSION.  THAT IS WHY OUR
CONGRATULATION MESSAGE BECOMES A PRAYER FOR THE LORD TO PROTECT THEM AND
HELP THEM NOT TO GIVE IN DURING DIFFICULT TIMES."

   GUATEMALA CITY, 4 AUG 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] POLICE REPORTED TODAY
THAT RENE LOPEZ, AN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC], WAS SHOT TO DEATH AFTER HE WAS KIDNAPPED BY
UNIDENTIFIED MEN.  

   THE AUTHORITIES DISCLOSED TODAY THAT LOPEZ, WHO WORKED AT THE
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT'S IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT, WAS KIDNAPPED ON 2 AUGUST
AND HIS BODY WAS FOUND IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY TODAY.  

   LOPEZ' DEATH IS ONE MORE PDC LEADER MURDERED.  DANILO BARILLAS, ANOTHER
PDC LEADER, WAS KILLED ON 1 AUGUST, APPARENTLY BY EXTREME RIGHTIST GROUPS.

   SO FAR, IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE TWO KILLINGS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE THE
AUTHORITIES HAVE REMAINED SILENT ABOUT THIS CASE WHICH WAS NOT DISCLOSED
UNTIL TODAY.

   UNOFFICIAL SOURCES NOTED THAT IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TWO LEADERS KNEW
TOO MANY DETAILS AND POSSIBLY NAMES OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN COCAINE
TRAFFICKING.

   HOWEVER, LOPEZ' RELATIVES REJECTED THAT HIS MURDER HAD ANY CONNECTION
WITH THE DRUG TRAFFICKING DISCOVERED AT THE AIRPORT THIS WEEK.

   SECURITY FORCES FOUND 22 KG OF COCAINE IN A SUITCASE OWNED BY JOSE
FERNANDO MINRO NAVAS, AN OFFICIAL OF THE PRESIDENCY'S ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT, ON 1 AUGUST.  MINRO WAS CAPTURED AND TURNED OVER TO A COURT.

   POLICE SOURCES STATED THAT THEY HAVE CONTINUED THE INVESTIGATIONS TO GET
MORE DETAILS OF THE TWO KILLINGS BUT THEY NEITHER DENIED NOR CONFIRMED ANY
CONNECTION OF SUSPECTED DRUG TRAFFICKERS WITH THE MURDER OF THE PDC
LEADERS.

THEIR TIRELESS STRUGGLE AGAINST SUBVERSION, THE POLICE TODAY PRESENTED
TO THE PRESS 29 SHINING PATH MEMBERS WHO WERE ARRESTED IN DIFFERENT

   TEGUCIGALPA, 3 AUG 89 (CADENA AUDIO VIDEO) -- [REPORT] [MIRIAM
MERCADO] [EXCERPTS] RAMON CUSTODIO LOPEZ, PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN
RIGHTS DEFENSE COMMITTEE [CODEH] HAS PREDICTED THAT THE TELA SUMMIT
WILL BE CHAOTIC BECAUSE, IN HIS OPINION, THE HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENTS WILL INTERFERE.  THE CODEH PRESIDENT ALSO REVEALED THAT
THE BATTALION 3-16'S NEW NAME IS THE COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION AND
ITS COMMANDER IS COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ.  CUSTODIO SAID THIS
DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HE HELD 2 AUGUST.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CUSTODIO] WE HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE
BECAUSE WE WANT TO WARN THE PEOPLE, THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHO ARE
HERE, AND THE OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE
OF INSECURITY WHICH AFFLICTS THE HONDURAN PEOPLE.

   FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL MENTION THE ASSASSINATIONS WHICH OCCURRED IN JULY
AT SAN PEDRO SULA: EDUARDO HERRERA, SALOMON VALLECILLO, AND DR RAMON ROBERTO
GARAY.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS
SO WE WOULD LIKE A JUDGE TO CALL THE NEW COMMANDER OF BATTALION 3-16 -- NOW
CALLED COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION -- COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ TO
TESTIFY.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT A MEMBER OF THE 3-16TH BATTALION CONTACTED
SALOMON VALLECILLO PRIOR TO HIS DEATH.

   LIKEWISE, I WANT TO MENTION HOW THE CITIZENRY IS EXPOSED TO POLICE
BRUTALITY.  THERE IS THE CASE OF JUSTO PASTOR ESCOBAR SILVA, WHO WAS
ASSASSINATED BY A FUSEP [PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES] AGENT WHO IS NOW
SERVING A PRISON SENTENCE.

   FURTHERMORE, PEOPLE FEEL INSECURE IN THE COUNTRY, AND I WILL
MENTION A CASE WHICH OCCURRED 3 WEEKS AGO.  DR MARCO ANTONIO BOGRAN
WAS TAKEN WITH ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEES TO THE DNI [DEPARTMENT OF
NATIONAL INVESTIGATION] AND HELD FROM 0800 TO 1500.  HE WAS NOT
ALLOWED TO CALL HIS LAWYER OR HIS RELATIVES, AND HE WAS HELD IN
ISOLATION.  HE WAS NATURALLY AFRAID THE WORST WOULD HAPPEN.  NO ONE
EXPLAINED ANYTHING UNTIL THE END.  HE WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD
REPORTEDLY MADE A SUBVERSIVE PHONE CALL FROM HIS HOUSE.  THIS MEANS
THAT HIS TELEPHONE IS BEING ILLEGALLY TAPPED BECAUSE NO ONE HERE HAS
THE RIGHT TO CONTROL ANYONE'S CALLS. THE MILITARY MEN IN CHARGE OF
HONDUTEL [HONDURAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE] ILLEGALLY ABUSE
THEIR POWER WHEN THEY HEAR AND CONTROL TELEPHONE CALLS BECAUSE THIS
SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]
[END RECORDING]

   COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ BENAVIDES, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES PUBLIC
RELATIONS OFFICE, HAS REACTED TO CUSTODIO LOPEZ' STATEMENT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [COL SUAREZ] I HAVE HEARD PART OF RAMON
CUSTODIO'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON CODEH FOREIGN POLICY, AND WE OBSERVED
HIS ANIMOSITY TOWARD THE CONTRAS AND HIS AFFECTION FOR THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN EL SALVADOR.  WE THOUGHT HE ONLY
HANDLED HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WE SEE HE ALSO DELVES IN FOREIGN POLICY.
HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE MAIN ISSUE.

   I WANT TO REFER TO THE FACT THAT YEARS AGO WE PUBLICLY PROVED THAT
BATTALION 3-16, WHICH HE MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES, HAD BEEN DISMANTLED SO THE
UNIT NO LONGER EXISTS.  NEVERTHELESS, HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS, OR HE
MAY BE INTENTIONALLY FORGETTING THIS.  THE UNIT DISAPPEARED BUT THE
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION HE MENTIONS DOES EXIST AND ITS COMMANDER,
WHICH HE MENTIONS, IS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES.  IN OTHER WORDS, HE HAS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTIVITIES THAT BATTALION 3-16 REPORTEDLY
CARRIED OUT.  IF CUSTODIO WANTS IT, WE CAN SEND HIM A COPY OF THE AGREEMENTS
TO DISMANTLE BATTALION 3-16 AND TO APPOINT THE CURRENT COMMANDER OF THE
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR MANY YEARS.  THAT IS
ALL.  I WANTED TO CLARIFY THIS AND I HOPE DR CUSTODIO IS MORE OBJECTIVE IN
HIS STATEMENTS.  I SOMETIMES BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM OF BEING ON ONE SIDE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE MIND.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, WHEN WILL THE ARMED FORCES BE ABLE TO GIVE THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE EXACT INFORMATION ON THE LATEST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
REPORTED MISSING IN OUR COUNTRY?

   [COL SUAREZ] EXCUSE ME, I CAN HARDLY HEAR YOU.

   [REPORTER] I ASKED: WHEN CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE HAVE EXACT
INFORMATION ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING IN THE
COUNTRY?

   [COL SUAREZ] LOOK, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL SHORTLY, AND I AM
TALKING ABOUT A SHORT TIME, HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE HONDURAN
PEOPLE ON THE PERSONS YOU HAVE MENTIONED BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS
CONTINUE.  THE POLICE ARREST PEOPLE BASED ON THE SUSPICION OR HARD,
RATIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIONS.  I
BELIEVE YOU WILL SOON HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ON THE PERSONS WHO HAVE
BEEN ARRESTED BY THE POLICE.  [END RECORDING]

   PYONGYANG (NORTH KOREA), 4 AUG 89 (KCNA) -- [TEXT] A LETTER TO THE
GREAT LEADER PRESIDENT KIM IL-SONG WAS ADOPTED AT A MEETING FOR
SOLIDARITY WITH THE KOREAN PEOPLE HELD IN LIMA, PERU, ON JULY 19.

   IN THE NAME OF THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE, IT CONDEMNED THE U.S.  IMPERIALISTS
WHO UNLEASHED ON JUNE 25, 1950, A WAR OF AGGRESSION AGAINST THE
NEWLY-FOUNDED DPRK WHICH WAS PURSUING A PEACE POLICY.

   THE U.S. IMPERIALISTS ADOPTED IN THE WAR THE SCORCHED EARTH TACTICS BY
INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING, BUT THEY COULD NOT BRING TO THEIR KNEES THE KOREAN
PEOPLE GUIDED BY THE RESPECTED MARSHAL KIM IL-SONG, THE FOUNDER OF THE GREAT
CHUCHE IDEA AND IRON-WILLED BRILLIANT COMMANDER, THE LETTER NOTED, ADDING:

   THE U.S. IMPERIALISTS SUFFERED THE MOST SERIOUS DEFEAT AND IGNONIMITY IN
THEIR HISTORY OF AGGRESSION, WHILE MARSHAL KIM IL-SONG, THE IRON-WILLED
BRILLIANT COMMANDER, DEFEATED THEM AND OPENED A ROAD OF LIBERATION TO THE
PEOPLE.

   IT SUPPORTED THE PROPOSALS FOR THE INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION
OF KOREA ADVANCED BY PRESIDENT KIM IL-SONG AND DEMANDED THAT THE U.S.
IMPERIALIST WITHDRAW ARMED FORCES AND NUCLEAR BASES FROM SOUTH KOREA.

   THE LETTER WISHED PRESIDENT KIM IL-SONG GOOD HEALTH AND LONG LIFE.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 7 AUG 89 (RADIO AMERICA) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [ORTEGA] I BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT
REALITY, WHICH IS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PEOPLES ARE TIRED OF WAR; THEY WANT PEACE.  WE CENTRAL
AMERICANS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE BEING KILLED, NOT THE U.S.  SOLDIERS.
THE UNITED STATES HAS THE DUTY TO RESPECT DECISIONS MADE BY THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ARE THE REAL BASES OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED WITH THE
NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION?

   [ORTEGA] IT IS A DOCUMENT THAT WAS SIGNED BY ALL POLITICAL PARTIES.
OBVIOUSLY, I SIGNED IT MYSELF.  THE MAIN POINT IN THE DOCUMENT IS THAT WE
PROPOSE THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS.  THAT WAS THE FIRST ISSUE WE
DISCUSSED.  THE DOCUMENT NOTES THAT ONCE THE CONTRAS ARE DISMANTLED, THERE
WILL BE AN AMNESTY, AND PRISONERS REMAINING IN NICARAGUA WILL BE RELEASED.
WE ALSO STRESSED THAT FOREIGN FORCES SHOULD NOT MEDDLE IN THE NICARAGUAN
ELECTION PROCESS; THE CIA, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO MEDDLE IN THE
NICARAGUAN ELECTION PROCESS; THIS WAS DISCUSSED AT THE U.S.  CONGRESS.
THEREFORE, WE ARE AGAINST THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY, WHICH SHOWS DISRESPECT FOR
NICARAGUAN SOVEREIGNTY.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] CONCERNING [WORDS INDISTINCT].
HOWEVER, IS IT NOT ALSO NECESSARY TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE CONTRAS?

   [ORTEGA] WHAT DID YOU SAY?  THAT WE MUST TALK TO THE CONTRAS?

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO TALK TO THE
CONTRAS?  

   [ORTEGA] WELL, WE WILL HAVE TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE CONTRAS TO FIND
OUT HOW THEY CAN BE DISLODGED [FROM HONDURAS] AND RETURN TO NICARAGUA;
OR WE MUST DISCUSS WHETHER THEY WANT TO STAY HERE IN HONDURAS --
BECAUSE SOME MAY WANT TO STAY IN HONDURAS AND OTHERS MAY WANT TO GO
ELSEWHERE, SUCH AS TO THE UNITED STATES.  I BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED
STATES SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT TO STAY IN CENTRAL
AMERICA, BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES PROMOTED THE CONTRAS.  THE UNITED
STATES SHOULD NOT PLACE THIS BURDEN ON HONDURAS OR ON THE OTHER
CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THEREFORE, WE WILL HAVE TO HOLD TALKS
WITH THE CONTRAS TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE, TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE IN
AN ORDERLY MANNER AND NOT BY SHOOTING AT THEM.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, THE CONTRAS ARE DEMANDING GUARANTEES.  

   [ORTEGA] GUARANTEES ALREADY EXIST IN NICARAGUA.  

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER ORTEGA, DO YOU HELP THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]?  

   [ORTEGA] WHAT?  

   [REPORTER] DO YOU PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN?  

   [ORTEGA] WE ARE IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] SAID IT HAS EVIDENCE THAT NICARAGUA
PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN.  THIS WAS SAID YESTERDAY BY
NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO.

   [ANNOUNCER] THE STATEMENTS BY COMMANDER DANIEL ORTEGA HAVE BEEN
INTERRUPTED BECAUSE THE PLANE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO THE AIRPORT IS ABOUT TO
TAKE OFF FROM THE TELA AIRPORT.  AT THIS TIME, THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER
IS ASKING MR ORTEGA TO GO TO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE FOREIGN MINISTER IS
TRYING TO CONVINCE ORTEGA TO STOP MAKING STATEMENTS, BUT MR ORTEGA SEEMS
VERY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS.  AT THIS MOMENT,
PRESIDENT ORTEGA CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BEING POSED BY LOCAL AND
FOREIGN NEWSMEN BECAUSE THE PLANE IS TAKING OFF.

   [REPORTER] MR ORTEGA...  

   [ORTEGA] INTERRUPTING CONCERNING YOUR QUESTION A FEW MINUTES AGO
REGARDING THE FMLN.  I JUST HELD A MEETING; I JUST HELD A MEETING WITH
THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND.  THEY ARE TOURING THE AREA, AND I HAVE MET
THEM.  THEY GAVE ME A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS EXPRESSING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, USING AS A BASIS THE DIALOGUE THAT THE FMLN HAS
HELD WITH THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES IN EL SALVADOR.  THE FLMN
RECENTLY MET WITH THE LEGALLY REGISTERED POLITICAL PARTIES IN EL
SALVADOR.  THE FMLN HAS MET WITH SOCIAL GROUPS, AND, AFTER THESE
TALKS, THEY MADE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL: TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE TO REACH A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE
ENDURING.  OUR DESIRE IS TO SUPPORT A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION -- AS
ESTABLISHED IN THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS - - TO FIND A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION TO THIS KIND OF CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT.  [CONTINUED]

   TEGUCIGALPA, 4 AUG 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE HONDURAN ARMY REPORTED
TODAY THAT IT DISMANTLED A SALVADORAN GUERRILLA CELL THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF
PROVIDING LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND TRANSPORTATION OF WEAPONS FROM NICARAGUA TO
EL SALVADOR THROUGH HONDURAN TERRITORY.  

   DURING MILITARY ACTIONS THAT BEGAN ON 29 JULY, ONE OF THE GUERRILLAS WAS
KILLED AND SIX WERE ARRESTED.  THREE OF THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED WERE
SALVADORAN CITIZENS AND THE OTHER THREE WERE HONDURANS, ACCORDING TO
DOCUMENTS THEY WERE CARRYING.

   THE DETAINEES WERE MEMBERS OF A CELL THAT TRANSPORTED WEAPONS TO THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IN NORTHERN EL SALVADOR
FROM NORTHERN NICARAGUA THROUGH EASTERN, CENTRAL, AND WESTERN HONDURAS.  

   THE GUERRILLAS, WHO ALSO TRANSPORTED MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, LITERATURE, AND
FOOD, RAN SMALL BUSINESSES IN HONDURAS THAT SERVED AS "FRONTS," A MILITARY
SOURCE SAID.

   ACCORDING TO HONDURAN ARMY SPOKESMAN COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ, THE
DETAINEES ARE IN COURT CUSTODY, AND 71 AK-47 RIFLES, RAMRODS, BAYONETS, AND
OTHER EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AS PROOF AGAINST THEM.

   COL SUAREZ CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF "SEVERAL OTHER GROUPS THAT WE ARE
INVESTIGATING WITH A VIEW TO DISMANTLING THEM."

   THE OFFICER SAID THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN PROVEN IF THE WEAPONS ARE SUPPLIED
TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT "BECAUSE SO FAR WE ONLY KNOW THAT THE WEAPONS ARE TRANSPORTED
FROM NICARAGUA TO EL SALVADOR THROUGH HONDURAS."

PRESIDENT MANUEL SOLIS PALMA HAS SAID IN LA PAZ, BOLIVIA THAT PANAMA
IS LIKE A COUNTRY BEING INVADED WITHOUT A SHOT BEING FIRED.  THAT IS
HOW THE PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THE PERMANENT U.S. INVASION ON
PANAMANIAN TERRITORY.  HE SAID THAT U.S. SOLDIERS PERMANENTLY VIOLATE
THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES AND FREQUENTLY OCCUPY UNAUTHORIZED ZONES
WITH TANKS AND SOLDIERS.

   SOLIS PALMA ALSO SAID PANAMA HAS AVOIDED PROVOCATIONS SO THAT THE
INVADERS CANNOT JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS, BUT IN CASE OF A CONFRONTATION, THE
PEOPLE AND THE PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES ARE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY.

   AS FOR PANAMA'S INTERNAL SITUATION, SOLIS PALMA SAID HIS GOVERNMENT IS
DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND OTHER SOCIAL
AND POLITICAL GROUPS SO THAT A NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT CAN BE CREATED
BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE CANAL BELONGS TO PANAMA AND NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY CANNOT BE VIOLATED.

NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[REPORTER] WHAT IS THE PREVAILING ATMOSPHERE NOW?

   [ORTEGA] I THINK THAT ALL OF THE PRESIDENTS ARE HOPING THAT AN
AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED. WE HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY WORKING ON THAT
AGREEMENT SO THAT A FINAL AGREEMENT CAN BE ISSUED. WE HAVE PREPARED
DOCUMENTS ON WHICH, I WOULD SAY, THERE IS A CERTAIN CONSENSUS--SUCH AS
ON THE DOCUMENT ON THE [WORD INDISTINCT] OF THE CONTRAS, THE DOCUMENT
ON THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE SUIT NICARAGUA HAS
FILED BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, THE SALVADORAN ISSUE,
AND OTHER POINTS.

   I THINK THERE IS A POLITICAL RESOLVE ON THE PART OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING POSITIVE EMERGES FROM THIS SUMMIT. I
AM SURE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS HOPING THAT NOTHING WILL RESULT FROM
THIS SUMMIT. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY
EXERTING STRONG PRESSURES SO THAT NOTHING WILL COME FROM THIS SUMMIT.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT: WHAT ARE THE PROCEDURES FOR NICARAGUA'S
WITHDRAWAL OF ITS SUIT AGAINST HONDURAS?  

   [ORTEGA] THIS HAS TO BE LINKED TO COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLAN FOR
THE CONTRA WITHDRAWAL.  

   [REPORTER] IN OTHER WORDS, THE CONTRAS MUST FIRST LEAVE?

   [ORTEGA] OF COURSE.  THAT IS OUR INSURANCE.  

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, HAS HONDURAS AGREED TO THIS?  

   [ORTEGA] WE ARE EXCHANGING VIEWPOINTS ON THIS.

   [REPORTER] THE SUIT REPRESENTS AN INSURANCE FOR YOU,
COMMANDER?  WHICH GROUPS HAS THE UNITED STATES BEEN PRESSURING?  

   [ORTEGA] THE CENTRAL AMERICAN GROUPS. THERE HAVE BEEN DIRECT AND
INDIRECT CONTACTS. THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTACTED THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN DELEGATIONS IN HOPES THAT NO AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED. THE
AMERICANS CONTINUE TO FAVOR THE PRESENCE OF THE CONTRAS. THE FACT THAT
PRESIDENT BUSH MET WITH CONTRA LEADERS ON THE EVE OF THIS CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SUMMIT IS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THIS MEETING.

   [REPORTER] WHEN YOU MENTION THESE PRESSURES, MR PRESIDENT, TO WHICH
COUNTRIES ARE YOU REFERRING?

   [ORTEGA] ALL OF THEM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NICARAGUA. I HAVE NO DOUBTS
THAT RIGHT NOW THE UNITED STATES IS EXERTING PRESSURE, BECAUSE IT WANTS TO
KILL THIS SUMMIT JUST WHEN WE ARE ABOUT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. IF NO
AGREEMENT IS REACHED AT THIS SUMMIT, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] BECAUSE WE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE
SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY AND SUFFICIENT SELF-DETERMINATION AND INDEPENDENCE TO
DECIDE OUR OWN ACTIONS.

   [REPORTER] AT THIS STAGE, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENTS SUMMIT?
IS THIS SUMMIT A FAILURE OR A SUCCESS?

   [ORTEGA] I THINK IT HAS TO BE A SUCCESS, EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES HAS
NOT GIVEN UP TRYING TO MAKE IT FAIL. THIS IS THE TIME, AND I AM SURE THAT IT
IS TRYING [WORDS INDISTINCT].

IN LIMA THAT THREE ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT
(MRTA) HAVE DIED IN A CLASH WITH THE NATIONAL POLICE (PN).  THE GUERRILLAS
WERE TRAVELING IN A STOLEN VEHICLE ON 6 AUGUST, WHEN THEY WERE DETECTED BY A
PN PATROL IN CHICLAYO PROVINCE.  THE PATROL ORDERED THEM TO STOP, BUT THE
GUERRILLAS FLED.  THE POLICE PATROL GAVE CHASE AND CAUGHT THE GUERRILLAS 15
KM FROM CHICLAYO, ON THE ROAD TO CHONGOYAPE.

   A CLASH ENSUED, AND JUAN ZURITA, CESAR ORBEGOZO, AND ERNESTO BENAVIDES
WERE KILLED.  THE INTERIOR MINISTRY BULLETIN REPORTS THAT THE POLICEMEN
SEIZED TWO SUB-MACHINE GUNS, A REVOLVER, AND AN MRTA FLAG FROM THE
GUERRILLAS.

   THE PRO-GUEVARA MRTA STARTED ITS ARMED FIGHT IN 1984, WHEN IT RIDDLED THE
U.S. EMBASSY WITH BULLETS.

   THE MRTA HAS ALSO ATTACKED THE CHINESE, SOVIET, SPANISH, AND ARGENTINE
EMBASSIES.

   IN JANUARY, THE POLICE ARRESTED MRTA'S MAIN LEADER, VICTOR POLAY CAMPOS.
AT LEAST 100 MRTA MEMBERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE POLICE THIS YEAR.

HUMILIATING DEFEATS FOR ANYONE.  WHAT I SEEK IS PEACE.  I SEEK
REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR HOMELAND.  I SEEK TO SOLVE THE SOCIAL
PROBLEMS OF OUR PEOPLE BY DEVELOPING AN ECONOMY THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL
SALVADORANS.

   TO THE LEADERS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES, A VITAL COMPONENT OF

FRATRICIDAL STRUGGLE.  I HOPE THE FMLN WILL HEAR THE CALL MADE BY THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHEN THE NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION AND DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESSES AS ESTABLISHED IN THE
ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS.  I ALSO HOPE THAT THE FMLN WILL SET ASIDE ITS
INTRANSIGENT ATTITUDE AND VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO CEASE ALL HOSTILITIES AND
THAT IT WILL DEMONSTRATE ITS PEACEFUL INTENTIONS BY STOPPING ALL TERRORIST
ACTIONS AGAINST THE PEOPLE.  I HOPE THE FMLN WILL MEET WITH US TO BEGIN THIS

ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS ADOPTED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ESQUIPULAS II
AT THE RECENT PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.  THIS DIALOGUE SHOULD BE HELD WITHOUT
CONDITIONS AND WITHOUT ANY PROPAGANDA.

   TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING THE HARD AND
SAD CONSEQUENCES OF A WAR AND WHO ARE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF
PEACE, I ASSURE YOU THAT MY GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK FOR PEACE BY
SETTING ASIDE ALL POLITICAL, PERSONAL, OR PARTISAN INTERESTS.  I WANT ALL
SALVADORANS TO CONTRIBUTE TO ACHIEVING A CIVILIZED END TO THE CONFLICT, AND
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL ATTITUDES THAT HINDER THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE SET
ASIDE. PEACE MUST NOT BE AN INSTRUMENT FOR AN IDEOLOGICAL OR PARTISAN
STRUGGLE.  LET US SWITCH THE ROLES.  LET US BE THE INSTRUMENTS FOR ACHIEVING
PEACE.  THE SELFISH ATTITUDE THAT HAS HURT THE HOMELAND DEEPLY MUST BE SET
ASIDE, AND WE MUST PLACE THE SACRED INTERESTS OF OUR BELOVED EL SALVADOR
ABOVE ALL ELSE.  

   PEACE CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE.  WE MUST UNDERSTAND
THAT ACHIEVING PEACE WILL BE THE BIGGEST VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE, AND THIS
DOES NOT MEAN IDEOLOGICAL SURRENDER.  WE ALL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF OUR CONSTITUTION.  THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES US IDEOLOGICAL
PLURALISM AND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY.

   SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US PRAY THAT GOD WILL OVERSEE THIS EFFORT FOR
PEACE.  MAY THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD GUIDE AND ENLIGHTEN US. THANK YOU AND
MAY GOD BLESS YOU.

AND ALSO EXTENDED FOR 60 DAYS THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN SEVEN PERUVIAN
DEPARTMENTS.  

   THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, INVOLVING AT LEAST HALF OF THE 22-MILLION
PERUVIAN POPULATION AND ONE-THIRD OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY, INVOLVES THE
SUSPENSION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND THE MILITARY CONTROL OF THE TERRITORY
AFFECTED BY THIS MEASURE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 AUG 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [REPORT] [ROSSIE
CASTILLO] [TEXT] NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTY MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON
SAID TODAY THAT THE POSITION ADOPTED BY EL SALVADOR THROUGH PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AT THE SUMMIT IN TELA, HONDURAS, IS POSITIVE BECAUSE
EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  HOWEVER,
HE SAID THAT THE POSITION OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] WILL ACTUALLY BE VERY CRITICAL NOW.  THE FMLN WILL
NOT LOOK GOOD INTERNATIONALLY IF IT REJECTS THE DIALOGUE.

   HERE IS AN EXCERPT OF D'AUBUISSON'S STATEMENTS, IN WHICH HE ALSO REVEALED
THAT COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS HAS OFFERED TO MEDIATE THE DIALOGUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON, IN PROGRESS] ... FALLACIES. THIS IS
NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE CLAIMED TO WANT SOMETHING AND ENDED UP
DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.  THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR
INTERNATIONAL IMAGE AND DO NOT WANT TO LOOK LIKE [WORD INDISTINCT]
BEFORE THE LITTLE MANGY-DOGS WHO GO ABOUT PLANTING BOMBS HERE.  THEY
WANT TO DEMONSTRATE PERHAPS THAT THEY ALWAYS HOLD A HEGEMONIC POSITION
HERE AND WILL TRY TO OBTAIN A BETTER NEGOTIATING POSITION FOR THEIR
ILLEGAL FORCES, WHICH ARE STILL GOING AROUND [WORD INDISTINCT] AND
KILLING PEOPLE [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [CASTILLO] NEVERTHELESS, MAJOR, DO YOU VIEW THIS MEETING AS POSITIVE
[WORD INDISTINCT] WITH THE FMLN -- THAT IS, THE DIALOGUE -- NOW THAT
SOMETHING TANGIBLE HAS COME OUT OF THE SUMMIT?  DO YOU THINK PEACE CAN BE
ACHIEVED?

   [D'AUBUISSON] THE OBJECTIVE OF ALL SALVADORANS -- AND IN THIS REGARD WE
SPEAK FROM THE HEART -- IS TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  IF THE FMLN COOPERATES, WE
WELCOME ITS COOPERATION.  HOWEVER, IF IT DOES NOT COOPERATE, THERE WILL BE
FMLN MEMBERS WHO WILL DEMOBILIZE, THE SAME WAY SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THE [WORD
INDISTINCT] ARE DESERTING.  THESE PEOPLE HAD TO BE GIVEN GUARANTEES.  WE
WILL SEE LATER IF, AS THEY SAY, THEY ARE TRULY WORKING, OR STRUGGLING, FOR
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] MORE POSITIVE ACTIONS.

   HOWEVER, WE SEE EVERYTHING AS BEING WELL ON THE WAY TO ACHIEVING PEACE IN
A SHORT TIME.  [END RECORDING]

   D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT IF THE FMLN DOES NOT AGREE TO THE DEMOBILIZATION,
THE FMLN MEMBERS WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE IF PEACE IS NOT ACHIEVED.
REGARDING THE COMMISSION, HE SAID IT IS ALREADY BEING ORGANIZED AND WILL
BEGIN A DIALOGUE SOON.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON, IN PROGRESS] ...A CONTINUOUS
DIALOGUE TO FIND SOLUTIONS.  THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS
INSTRUCTED THAT IT HAVE NO PRIOR AGENDA BUT THAT IT JUST BEGIN.  THEIR
FIRST STEP SHOULD BE TO SIT DOWN AT A TABLE TO TALK, TO NEGOTIATE, TO
ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE.  AND THIS IS TO GO ON CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL SOLUTIONS
ARE FOUND AND THEY ACHIEVE SOMETHING TANGIBLE, WHICH IS THE FINAL
SOLUTION.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] 

   [D'AUBUISSON] WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT ARIAS HAS
OFFERED TO ACT AS MEDIATOR OR INTERMEDIARY.  HE SAID THAT IF THE
COMMISSION GOES TO SAN JOSE, HE WILL TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO INVITE
THESE GENTLEMEN TOO AND TO GIVE THEM WHATEVER THEY NEED FOR THIS
MEETING TO BEGIN.  AFTER THAT, THEY THEMSELVES WILL DEVELOP THE
MECHANISMS.  [END RECORDING]

   MAJ D'AUBUISSON SAID THE COMMISSION WILL BE SWORN IN AND WILL MAINTAIN AN
ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN REPRESENTATIVES.

   COMMENTING ON LEGISLATIVE WORK, HE SAID THAT TODAY THE POLITICAL
COMMITTEE WILL MEET TO ELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRUPTION,
WHICH HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY NEGLECTED BY DR JAIME VENTURA.  THE ONLY
CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRUPTION IS DEPUTY
ROBERTO ANGULO, VICE PRESIDENT AND ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY.

   BOGOTA, 7 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [EXCERPTS] [PASSAGE OMITTED] SIMON BOLIVAR
AND FRANCISCO DE PAULA SANTANDER GAVE OUR ARMED FORCES THE MISSION OF
DEFENDING FREEDOM, INDEPENDENCE, AND DEMOCRACY.  THROUGHOUT HISTORY,
THE NATIONAL ARMY HAS COMPLIED WITH THAT MANDATE.  IT HAS NOT BEEN AN
EASY TASK, EVEN LESS SO DURING THE TIMES WE ARE LIVING.  VERY FEW
NATIONS HAVE HAD TO CONFRONT SIMULTANEOUSLY SO MANY DIFFICULT
CHALLENGES.  CONFRONTED BY A COMBINATION OF SOURCES OF DISRUPTION, THE
ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT LOST THEIR DETERMIANTION AND OPTIMISM, NOR HAVE
THEY STOPPED FOR 1 MINUTE TO STRUGGLE FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT OF
TRANQUILLITY FOR THE CITIZENS, AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIFE, HONOR,
AND PROPERTY OF COLOMBIANS.

   AS THE VIOLENCE INCREASES, OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND COLOMBIA IS
STRENGTHENED.  THE PRICE OF COURAGE AND FIRMNESS HAS BEEN HIGH.  MANY
SOLDIERS, OFFICERS, AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED, BUT THEY
ARE THE HEROES OF DEMOCRACY.  ON THE OCCASION OF ARMY DAY, I SPEAK ON BEHALF
OF THE VAST NATIONAL MAJORITY AND CONVEY TO THEIR FAMILIES, FRIENDS, AND
FELLOW SOLDIERS OUR MESSAGE OF ENCOURAGEMENT, APPRECIATION, AND HOPE.  THEIR
EFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN IN VAIN.

   THE BATTLE TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND DEFEAT VIOLENCE CONTINUES.  THE
DETERMINATION OF COLOMBIANS DOES NOT WEAKEN.  OUR ENEMIES ARE ALONE, AS
NEVER BEFORE, AND THIS WE OWE TO PERMANENT ACTIONS BY OUR ARMED FORCES.

   IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, I OFFERED THE COLOMBIANS A POLICY OF
RECONCILIATION BASED ON DEFINED GUIDELINES AND CLEAR PRINCIPLES.  THIS WAS
THE DEMOCRATIC MANDATE THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE PEOPLE.  NOW, WHEN WE ARE
HARVESTING THE RESULTS OF THAT STRATEGY, WE WILL NOT GIVE UP.  THE PEACE
INITIATIVE HAS SHOWED THAT IT CAN OPERATE AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE
FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE WILL CONDUCT POLITICAL ACTION FOR NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION.

   SOME BELIEVE THAT TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO LEAVE IT
IDLE, AT THE MERCY OF VIOLENCE.  OTHERS ARGUE THAT PEACE CAN ONLY BE
ACHIEVED IF WE DISMANTLE OUR CAPABILITY TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.  WE DO NOT
AGREE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONFIRMED THAT STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND THE
QUEST FOR PEACE ARE NOT ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH IMPROVING AND STRENGTHENING THE
ARMED FORCES, BUT THAT THIS IS INDISPENSABLE FOR ADVANCING THE POLITICAL
HANDLING OF VIOLENCE.

   EFFICIENT, PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES THAT SERVE THE COUNTRY ARE A
DEFINITE GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.
THAT IS WHY THIS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A GREAT ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL
EFFORT TO RETURN TO THE MILITARY INSTITUTIONS COMPLETE FREEDOM OF ACTION.

   THIS COMMEMORATION OF THE 170TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR INDEPENDENCE IS A
SUITABLE TIME TO PONDER OUR DUTY TO THE HOMELAND.  I AM NOT REFERRING TO
DAILY CIVIC DUTIES, WHICH ARE PROPER TO ALL OF US COLOMBIANS, BUT TO
SOMETHING MUCH DEEPER -- LOYALTY TO DEMOCRACY AND OUR INSTITUTIONS.
DEMOCRACY'S BOUNDARIES ARE BROAD, BUT PRECISE.  WHEN VIOLENCE TO A CERTAIN
EXTENT IS TOLERATED, MORE VIOLENCE IS CREATED, THERE IS A CONSPIRACY AGAINST
PEACE, AND CONFLICTS ARE AGGRAVATED.  THE ENTIRE SOCIETY HAS SUFFERED
BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENEMIES OF COLOMBIA.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] 

   I CONGRATULATE THE OFFICERS, CIVILIAN PERSONALITIES, SERGEANT AMAYA
ALVAREZ, AND PRIVATE MALAMBO TIQUE, WHOSE MERITS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED TODAY IN
THE NAME OF THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND THE GOVERNMENT.  [APPLAUSE] THIS
CEREMONY, IN WHICH WE HONOR THE HEROES OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE ARMY, IS A
SUITABLE OCCASION TO MAKE KNOWN TO OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND
SOLDIERS ALIKE THE NATION'S RECOGNITION OF THEIR COURAGEOUS AND PROFESSIONAL
FULFILLMENT OF THEIR DUTIES.  WHEN THE ARMED FORCES ACADEMIES PARADE BEFORE
US, SO WILL THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO SERVING
THE HOMELAND AND THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN.  EVERY HONEST COLOMBIAN SUPPORTS
THEM.

   SOLDIERS: YOU, WHO WIELD THE NATION'S ARMS, REPRESENT THE BASIC GUARANTEE
THAT PRESERVES SOVEREIGNTY, LIBERTY, AND OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  THANK
YOU.  [APPLAUSE]

   GUATEMALA CITY, 10 AUG 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THREE EXPLOSIONS ROCKED
GUATEMALA CITY TODAY, LEAVING AT LEAST ONE DEAD, FIVE WOUNDED, AND VEHICLES
AND STORES DAMAGED.

   THE MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS WHO THREW A
GRENADE AT A PRIVATELY OWNED PASSENGER BUS ON KILOMETER 6 OF THE ROAD
LINKING GUATEMALA CITY WITH PUERTO BARRIOS, ON THE ATLANTIC COAST.  ONE
PERSON WAS KILLED AND AT LEAST FIVE WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK.  THE
FATALITY WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN.

   ANOTHER EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ZONE 5 OF GUATEMALA CITY,
IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY PRIEST OF ARS, WHOSE PARISH PRIEST, JOSE
MARIA RUIZ (FATHER CHEMITA), WAS PREPARING TO SAY MASS.

   THREE VEHICLES WERE DAMAGED BY THIS EXPLOSION.  THIS WEEK FATHER
CHEMITA, FORMER CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR OF GUATEMALA CITY, ACCUSED ALFONSO

   LIMA, 13 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MINERS TODAY REPORTED
IN LIMA THAT PERUVIAN SOLDIERS HAVE ARRESTED AT LEAST 22 MINERS, INCLUDING 4
REGIONAL LEADERS, ON THE EVE OF THE MINERS NATIONAL STRIKE, WHICH IS
SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON 14 AUGUST.  THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 100,000 MINERS IN
PERU.  

   THE SPOKESMAN TOLD EFE THAT THE SOLDIERS ARRESTED MINERS AT THE LA OROYA,
MOROCOCHA, CASA PALCA, AND AUSTRIA-DUVALZ MINING CAMPS IN THE CENTRAL PART
OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGE.  IN LIMA, THE POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR THE MAIN LEADERS
OF THE MINERS.

   THE FEDERATION OF MINERS AND METALWORKERS HAS CALLED A NATIONAL STRIKE
FOR 14 AUGUST TO PRESSURE THE COURTS INTO RULING IN FAVOR OF A "SINGLE
NATIONAL LIST OF DEMANDS," WHICH WILL ALLOW THE FEDERATION TO REPRESENT ALL
PERUVIAN MINERS AT THE DISCUSSIONS OF LABOR AND SALARY ISSUES.

   ON FRIDAY, 11 AUGUST, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT ORDERED ARMY SOLDIERS AND
NAVY MARINES TO GUARD MINING CAMPS IN ORDER TO PREVENT POSSIBLE ATTACKS AND
SABOTAGE DURING THE STRIKE, THE FIRST THIS YEAR.

   TERRORISTS HAVE ATTACKED SEVERAL MINES LATELY AND HAVE KILLED
APPROXIMATELY 12 MINERS, INCLUDING SAUL CANTORAL, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE
FEDERATION.

   THE MINERS WENT ON STRIKE FOR ALMOST 100 DAYS LAST YEAR. THAT STRIKE
CAUSED LOSSES ESTIMATED AT $500 MILLION, ONE-THIRD OF PERU'S OVERALL MINING
EXPORTS.

   THE STRIKE WILL AFFECT CENTRAL PERUVIAN MINING ENTERPRISE, THE LARGEST
STATE-OWNED CORPORATION; THE U.S. COMPANY SOUTHERN PERU COPPER CORPORATION,
WHICH EXPLOITS 75 PERCENT OF THE PERUVIAN COPPER; AND THE ILO REFINERY, THE
SECOND LARGEST IN PERU.

   NO CITY (PERU), NO DATE -- [SPEECH] [GARCIA] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
ARTICLE 5 ADDS: ALL MEN FROM 18 TO 50 YEARS OF AGE AND WOMEN FROM 18
TO 45 YEARS OF AGE ARE OBLIGED TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAW, THUS THIS
PERIOD OF LIFE IS CALLED MILITARY AGE.  THIS MEANS THAT ALL 18- TO
50-YEAR-OLD PERUVIANS ARE OF MILITARY AGE, AND WE ARE OBLIGED TO
COMPLY WITH THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW, IN THE RESERVE.

   THEREFORE, ONE NOT ONLY COMPLIES WITH THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN ONE
IS ASSIGNED ON ACTIVE DUTY TO A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2 YEARS, BUT ONE
CONTINUES COMPLYING WITH THIS LAW BY REMAINING IN THE RESERVE UNTIL 50 YEARS
OF AGE.

   ARTICLE 272 OF THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES:  MEN FROM 18 TO 50 YEARS
OF AGE AND WOMEN BETWEEN 18 AND 45 YEARS OF AGE WHO ARE NOT ON ACTIVE
MILITARY SERVICE ALL BELONG TO THE RESERVE, AND THEY MUST COMPLY WITH THE
OBLIGATIONS ESTABLISHED BY CLAUSE 4 OF THIS LAW.

   IF THE LAW STATES THIS, I THEN ASK ALL PERUVIANS: ARE NOT TERRORISTS --
WHO ARE PART OF THE ARMED FORCES RESERVES AND WHO TAKE ARMS TO ATTACK THE
NATIONAL POLICE AND ARMED FORCES -- VIOLATING THE OBLIGATORY MILITARY
SERVICE LAW?  IS NOT HE, WHO BY VIOLENT MEANS TRIES TO DESTROY THE
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF WHICH THE ARMED FORCES ARE PART, VIOLATING THE
MILITARY SERVICE LAW?

   THEREFORE, SINCE ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT THOSE WHO
VIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW CAN BE TRIED BY THE MILITARY
CODE OF JUSTICE, THEN TERRORISTS CAN BE TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS.

   THUS THE IDEA IS THAT ONE LAW, ONE ARTICLE, SHOULD ESTABLISH THAT THE
CRIME OF TERRORISM VIOLATES THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW, THEREFORE ENABLING A
QUICK AND DRASTIC PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS.  

   IT WILL THEREFORE NOT BE NECESSARY TO AMMEND THE CONSTITUTION.  A CORRECT
INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IS ALL THAT WILL BE NEEDED.  WE MUST ALSO
REMEMBER THAT WHEN THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION WAS APPROVED THERE WAS NO
SERIOUS TERRORIST PROBLEM.  BESIDES, YOU MUST KNOW THAT TO AMMEND THE
CONSTITUTION WE MUST WAIT NEARLY 2 YEARS, AND WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE.

   MANY PERUVIANS THINK THAT IF MILITARY COURTS TRY TERRORISTS THEY WILL BE
SENTENCED TO DEATH.  THIS IS FALSE, IT IS NOT CORRECT.  THE MILITARY COURTS
WILL ONLY RULE SENTENCES IN KEEPING WITH THE LAW, BUT THESE SENTENCES WILL
BE APPLIED FIRMLY.  THIS MEANS THAT CRIMINALS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED.

   I ASK ALL PERUVIANS AND ALL INSTITUTIONS TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL.
TERRORISTS MUST NOT REMAIN UNPUNISHED.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DO NOT
TRUST THE CIVILIAN COURTS.  THIS MEANS THAT WE MUST SIMPLY INTERPRET THE
CONSTITUTION APPROPRIATELY.  TERRORISTS REALLY DO VIOLATE THEIR CONDITION AS
ARMED FORCES RESERVES WHEN THEY TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES.

   IT IS THEREFORE OUR PURPOSE TO DO THINGS CORRECTLY.  THE CONSTITUTION
MUST BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF PERU, SINCE IT CANNOT BE INTERPRETED IN
FAVOR OF THE TERRORISTS.  

   I AM SURPRISED THAT ON THE ONE SIDE PEOPLE CRITICIZE THE LITTLE ACTION
 TAKEN AGAINST TERRORISTS, WHILE ON THE OTHER THEY DO NOT ACCEPT A CONCRETE
INITIATIVE LIKE THIS ONE TO PUNISH THEM.

   THIS IS THE MOMENT TO RESUME THE DISCUSSION ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE THE
ELECTION CAMPAIGNS MAKE US FORGET THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  ON
THE CONTRARY, IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE ELECTIONS WE MUST QUICKLY MAKE ALL
THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND APPROVE STRICT PUNISHMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO
LIVE IN DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, PEACE, AND SAFETY. THANK YOU.

   LA PAZ, 12 AUG 89 (PRESENCIA) -- [EXCERPT] DEFENSE MINISTER HECTOR
HORMACHEA HAS REVEALED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ASKED TO BE
WITHDRAWN FROM THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING BECAUSE THAT
MISSION HAS THE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF THE POLICE.

   ORMACHEA EXPLAINED THAT THE ARMED FORCES' ROLE IN DRUG CONTROL WILL BE
EVALUATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY CHIEFS BEFORE A FINAL DECISION IS
MADE.

   ORMACHEA MADE THESE COMMENTS DURING HIS FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE TO TALK
ABOUT THE VARIOUS ISSUES RELATED TO HIS MINISTRY.

   HE ADDED THAT THE NAVY AND THE AIR FORCE CURRENTLY CARRY OUT A SUPPORT
MISSION IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS THE ENTIRE TASK IS
CARRIED OUT BY THE MOBIL UNITS FOR RURAL AREAS (UMOPAR), WHICH ARE UNDER THE
POLICE.

   IN HIS FIRST WEEK AS THE NEW MINISTER, ORMACHEA HELD PRELIMINARY TALKS
WITH SEVERAL MILITARY CHIEFS TO GET FAMILIAR WITH THE ARMED FORCES' ROLE IN
CONTROLLING DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   HE SAID: "WE MUST CAREFULLY STUDY AND EVALUATE THE SITUATION TO DETERMINE
THE ARMED FORCES' DEGREE OF PARTICIPATION IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING."

   HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES WANTED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE STRUGGLE
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT INITIALLY BEGAN, BUT THEY THEN DECIDED TO
CARRY OUT A SUPPORT MISSION.  HE ADDED: WE ARE GOING TO STUDY THIS AT THE
GOVERNMENT LEVEL, WITH THE PRESIDENT MAKING THE FINAL DECISION ON THE ROLE OF
THE ARMED FORCES.

   ORMACHEA ALSO SAID THAT INTERNAL SECURITY IS CLOSELY LINKED TO HOW THE
ARMED FORCES ARE EQUIPPED, BUT ALSO TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY,
ESPECIALLY IN THE POOREST ZONES AND BORDER AREAS.

   HE SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN TALK LATELY ABOUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES,
ALTHOUGH THE REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN VERY CLEAR.  THERE WERE APPARENTLY
INCURSIONS BY UNIDENTIFIED ARMED GROUPS, MURDER, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT
MAY JEOPARDIZE THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL SECURITY.

   ORMACHEA SAID THAT INTERNAL SECURITY AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WILL
CONTINUE TO BE THE ARMED FORCES' MAIN CONCERN.

   REGARDING THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MILITARY ADVISORS INVOLVED IN THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, ORMAECHEA NOTED THAT "THAT WORK WILL BE
USEFUL AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE WORK OF BOLIVIAN
ORGANIZATIONS."  

   HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT CHANGING THE PREVIOUS DEFENSE MINISTRY'S
POLICY OF ADMINISTRATIVE CENTRALIZATION OF ECONOMIC RESOURCES IS A POSITIVE
STEP. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

A FEW MINUTES AGO THE ASONAL [NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE JUDICIAL

   TODAY, THE 54 MAGISTRATES WHO COMPOSE THE CIVIL, LABOR, AND PENAL COURTS
OF THE BOGOTA SUPERIOR TRIBUNAL TENDERED THEIR RESIGNATIONS UNTIL THE
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES THEM SAFETY AND PROTECTION FOR THEIR LIVES SO THAT
THEY CAN DISPENSE JUSTICE IN COLOMBIA.  

   THE MURDER OF JUSTICE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA LED THE COLOMBIAN
MAGISTRATES TO SUSPEND ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  THE MAGISTRATES OF THE BOGOTA
SUPERIOR TRIBUNAL SAID THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT ADDED THAT
THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE THE NEXT VICTIMS EITHER.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED JUDGE] WE FEEL WE ARE WAGING A USELESS
STRUGGLE.  WE ARE FIGHTING FOR IDEALS THAT NOBODY SHARES.  WHAT WE WANT IS
FOR THE COUNTRY TO BEGIN TO SHARE THOSE IDEALS.  WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WE, THE

BEEN ONLY THAT, PROMISES.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE PLAN TO PROVIDE PROTECTION,
ESCORTS, AND ARMORED VEHICLES HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED.

   IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT TO END THIS WAVE OF MURDERS THE GOVERNMENT
MUST SHOW THE POLITICAL RESOLVE TO ERADICATE IT.  THE GOVERNMENT MUST
CONFRONT THIS PROBLEM BY USING OUR ARMED FORCES WITH DUE RESPECT FOR HUMAN
RIGHTS.  AS LONG AS THAT IS NOT DONE, NOT ONLY JUDGES, BUT THE BEST CHILDREN

THE STATE OF SIEGE [MEDIDAS DE ESTADO DE SITIO] WHICH HAVE BEEN

AND MOVED BY THE SERIOUS ACTIONS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN

SENATOR GALAN HAS BEEN TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL.  LET US PRAY TO GOD THAT

   THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS HAVE UNLEASHED A

   VIOLENCE AFFECTS ALL.  IT IS NOT AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR

COUNTRY MUST RESPOND.  I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THE MURDER OF MAGISTRATE CARLOS
VALENCIA LED THE JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO PROTEST AND TO REQUEST MORE
PROTECTION, BUT FOR THE MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES TO RESIGN ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO
WORSENING THE SITUATION WHICH WE MUST ALL SOLVE BY WORKING TOGETHER.  THIS
IS ALSO EQUIVALENT TO YIELDING TO THE TERRORISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO PARALYZE
THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

   TRUE HEROES SUCH AS CARLOS VALENCIA, WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, AND
OTHER JUDGES, POLICEMEN, SOLDIERS, AND BODYGUARDS HAVE PREVENTED THIS BY
FULFILLING THEIR DUTIES WITHOUT YIELDING TO INTIMIDATION OR BRIBERY.  I
INVITE ALL JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO RESUME THEIR WORK.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS
ADOPTED MORE MEASURES TO PROTECT THEM, AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO RENDER ALL
THE COOPERATION THEY REQUIRE AND WHICH IS AVAILABLE.  ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS
MUST JOIN THE EFFORTS.  NO MORE LAMENTATIONS WITHOUT TRUE ACTION OF
COOPERATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES.

   IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL FORCES OF THE STATE AND OF SOCIETY -- POLITICAL
PARTIES, UNIONS, MEDIA, CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS -- ALL SERVE JUSTICE AND THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST CRIME.  WE MUST BE PREPARED TO ENDURE MORE SORROW AND
SUFFERINGS.  ONLY IF ALL COLOMBIA PERSEVERES IN A TRULY STRONG AND SOLID
MANNER -- BUT NOT JUST WITH WORDS -- IN THE DIFFICULT BATTLE AGAINST CRIME,
WILL WE BE ABLE TO BANISH VIOLENCE.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN, LIBERAL
PARTY PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, WAS SHOT THIS EVENING WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE
A SPEECH AT MAIN SQUARE OF SOACHA, 15 KM SOUTH OF BOGOTA, IT WAS CONFIRMED
BY POLICE AND HEALTH AUTHORITIES.

   ACCORDING TO THE FIRST REPORTS, AT LEAST ONE MAN FIRED ON THE SENATOR
FROM AMONG THOSE GATHERED.  THE SENATOR IS CURRENTLY AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM
OF A HOSPITAL IN BOSA, CLOSE TO SOACHA.  TWO OTHER PERSONS WERE WOUNDED
DURING THE ATTACK.

   BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE MEDICAL AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED
THAT LUIS CARLOS CARLOS GALAN, SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, DIED
TONIGHT 2 HOURS AFTER HAVING BEEN SHOT IN AN ATTACK.  

   GALAN, 46, WAS MACHINEGUNNED TOGETHER WITH FIVE OTHER PERSONS WHO WERE
WOUNDED WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO DELIVER A SPEECH TONIGHT IN SOACHA, NEAR BOGOTA.


DEV-MUC3-0353 (BBN)

   BOGOTA, 19 AUG 89 -- [SPEECH] [BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THAT
MEASURE WILL BE COMPLEMENTED WITH A DECREE -- WHICH FALLS UNDER THE
PROVISION OF THE STATE OF SIEGE -- ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO WITH
THE EXCUSE OF CARRYING OUT POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS OR OTHER ELECTION
ACTIVITIES USE WEAPONS OR THREATEN PEOPLE BY OTHER MEANS TO OBTAIN
SUPPORT OR VOTES FOR A SPECIFIC CANDIDATE OR LIST OF CANDIDATES AND
ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO USING THOSE SAME MEANS PREVENT A CITIZEN
FROM EXERCISING HIS RIGHT TO VOTE, WILL BE IMPRISONED FOR 3 TO 6 YEARS
AND WILL HAVE TO PAY A FINE EQUIVALENT TO 10 TO 50 TIMES THE LEGAL
MONTHLY MINIMUM WAGE.

   AS FOR THE MEDIA, WHOSE ROLE IS ESSENTIAL IN THE MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC
ORDER IN THE COUNTRY, I WOULD ONLY STATE THAT THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES
THEM FULL FREEDOM IN TIMES OF PEACE, BUT THEY WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE
BEFORE THE LAW WHEN THEY ATTACK PEOPLE'S HONOR, SOCIAL ORDER, OR PUBLIC
TRANQUILLITY.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL THEN ENFORCE THOSE LAWS IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE CONSTITUTION.

   BASED ON SPECIAL POWERS, TODAY THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED OTHER DECREES THAT
THE NATIONAL CONGRESS APPROVED ON A GOVERNMENT REQUEST.  I WILL MENTION ONLY
ONE OF THOSE DECREES.  THIS DECREE AMENDS OUR PENAL CODE.

   THE PUBLIC NAMING OF JURORS WILL BE ELIMINATED.  ORGANIZED CRIME TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF THAT JURY APPOINTMENT SYSTEM AND AVOIDED THE ACTION OF JUSTICE
BY INTIMIDATING JURORS.  THE NEW DECREE REDUCES FORMALITIES AND CREATES
ROVING JUDGES WHO WILL HAVE AUTHORITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THUS
INCREASING THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.  THOSE JUDGES WILL JUDGE
ANY CRIME THAT WILL BE GIVEN SPECIAL IMPORTANCE FOR REASONS OF PUBLIC ORDER.

   THESE MEASURES HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY STUDIED.  THAT, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN
THEY CANNOT BE SUPPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE IF NECESSARY.

   WHEN DRAFTING THESE DECREES WE, AS USUAL, PAID DUE ATTENTION TO THE
HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE'S DECISIONS SO THAT THE CURRENT DECREES
FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE GUIDELINES OF THE CONSTITUTION.

   THE THREAT THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND ORGANIZED CRIME REPRESENT JUSTIFIES
THE SEVERITY OF THE MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED.  COLOMBIANS CAN BE SURE WE
WILL CONTINUE MAKING ALL THE NECESSARY EFFORTS TO REGAIN TRANQUILLITY IN
COLOMBIA.  I AM SURE WE WILL OVERCOME THESE DIFFICULTIES.  A HANDFUL OF
CRIMINALS WILL NOT DEFEAT A UNIFIED NATION THAT IS WILLING TO STRUGGLE
AGAINST CRIME.

   WE ARE CERTAINLY EXPERIENCING A DIFFICULT TIME.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE
EXPERIENCED EVEN MORE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS AND COLOMBIA OVERCAME THEM.  WE
MUST NOT STRAY FROM OUR PATH, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE CRIMINALS WANT.  BY
FALLING INTO DESPAIR WE WILL BE PLAYING THE TERRORISTS' GAME.  IF WE
CONTINUE AHEAD FIRMLY AND DECISIVELY, WE WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER RESULTS.
INSTEAD OF WASTING OUR TIME IN DISPUTES AND RECIPROCAL REPROACHES, LET US
UNITE OUR ACTIONS AGAINST OUR COMMON ENEMY.  WE MUST WIN THIS WAR.  I AM
SURE WE WILL SUCCEED.  GOOD EVENING AND SEE YOU SOON.

COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE ANNOUNCED THE SUSPENSION OF
THEIR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS.  ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE UNANIMOUSLY
REJECTED THE MURDER OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN.  THE WAVE OF POLITICAL
MURDERS HAS LEFT THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF SHOCK.  FOLLOWING ARE SOME
REACTIONS VOICED TODAY AT THE WAKE FOR THE MURDERED LIBERAL CANDIDATE:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO] THE
COUNTRY HAS BEEN ATTACKED FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS AND IT HAS NOT ACCEPTED THIS
FACT.  I HAVE REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A STATE OF SIEGE TO BE IMPLEMENTED.  AT
LAST, THE STATE OF SIEGE WAS DECLARED YESTERDAY.  I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR
THIS FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS.  GALAN WOULD NOT BE DEAD TODAY IF THE PROPOSAL WE
MADE 3 YEARS AGO WOULD HAD BEEN ACCEPTED.

   [FORMER LIBERAL COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT ALFONSO LOPEZ MICHELSEN] IT WAS RIGHT
TO CALL FOR A REACTION FROM THE COUNTRY; WE HAVE TO LEARN TO REACT, AND IT

COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE, WARNED THE COUNTRY TODAY THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS
"WILL CONTINUE TO SHOOT," AND ANNOUNCED AN ALL-OUT DECLARATION OF WAR
AGAINST THEM.

   MAZA, WHO 1 MONTH AGO ESCAPED MIRACULOUSLY FROM A CAR BOMB ATTACK STAGED
BY THE DRUG MAFIA, WARNED ABOUT THE "WAR" THAT THE "DRUG LORDS" HAVE
UNLEASHED AGAINST THE COUNTRY, NOTING THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO FIRE THEIR
WEAPONS.

   THE POLICE CHIEF DECLARED THAT THE STATE ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING
CRIMINALITY WILL STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE WHO SEEK BY THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIONS
TO IMPOSE THEIR OWN LAWS.

   ALSO, MAZA DIRECTLY ACCUSED THE DRUG CARTELS OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
CHAIN OF ASSASSINATIONS THAT HAVE SHAKEN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS.

   "WE ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT THEM," HE WARNED.

   THE SEVERE MEASURES ADOPTED LAST NIGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF
LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, AFTER THE KILLINGS DURING THE PAST 72
HOURS OF A JUDGE, A POLICE COMMANDER, AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS
GALAN, WILL PERMIT THE SECURITY CORPS TO FORCEFULLY CONFRONT THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE THAT HAS GRIPPED COLOMBIA, HE DECLARED.

ASSASSINATION OF LIBERAL LEADER LUIS CARLOS GALAN, THE 4,015 JUDGES OF
THE COUNTRY DECIDED TO LIFT THE STRIKE THEY HAD CALLED ON 17 AUGUST,
FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF A MAGISTRATE, AND WITHDREW THEIR
RESIGNATIONS.

   IT IS NOT THE MOMENT TO GO ON STRIKE OR TO RESIGN, JOSE GABRIEL SALOM,
PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME TRIBUNAL OF BOGOTA, STATED.  HE AND 47 COLLEAGUES
HAD PRESENTED THEIR RESIGNATION LAST FRIDAY TO PROTEST THE ASSASSINATION OF
MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA, PRESUMABLY BY PAID ASSASSINS OF DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.  VALENCIA GARCIA HAD REJECTED THE APPEALS TO EXONERATE PABLO
ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, KINGPINS OF THE COCAINE
TRAFFICKING GROUP OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, FROM THE CHARGE THAT THEY HAD
MASTERMINDED THE ASSASSINATION OF JOURNALIST GUILLERMO CANO, DIRECTOR OF THE
NEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR, AND JAIME PARDO LEAL, PRESIDENT OF THE OPPOSITION
PARTY PATRIOTIC UNION.

   ANTONIO SUAREZ, PRESIDENT OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH PUBLIC EMPLOYEES
ASSOCIATION, ANNOUNCED THAT THE STRIKE HAS BEEN CALLED OFF AND THAT NINE
JUDGES ARE INVESTIGATING THE ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR GALAN.  

   THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WILL RESUME ACTIVITIES ON TUESDAY.  THE STRIKE OF THE
JUDGES, COMPOUNDED BY THE RESIGNATION OF SOME OF THEM, INTERRUPTED THE
CONSIDERATION OF THREE CASES.  THE STRIKE WAS ALSO CALLED TO FORCE THE
GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TO ADOPT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE
MAGISTRATES WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY ORGANIZED CRIME.

   AMONG THE EMERGENCY MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT ARE SOME THAT WILL
CONTRIBUTE TO HELPING THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO CONFRONT THE THREAT POSED BY
THE DEATH SQUADS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
D'AUBUISSON BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER]
THIS OFFICIAL TOLD YOU THAT?  DOES THIS OFFICIAL, WHOSE NAME YOU DO
NOT DISCLOSE, HAVE CREDIBILITY WITH THE GOVERNMENT?

   [D'AUBUISSON] ALLOW ME TO RESERVE THE IDENTITY OF THE SOURCE, BUT HE DOES
HAVE MUCH CREDIBILITY.  HE IS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT
MOVEMENT, AND HE DOES HAVE CREDIBILITY.  THE INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS IS
THE WAY THIS BIG MANGY DOG, THIS MR VILLALOBOS, THINKS.  IF HE WANTS TO COME
HERE AND PARTICIPATE, WE'LL TAKE HIS WORD, AND LET US SEE IF HE WILL REALLY
HAVE A LANDSLIDE VICTORY.

   [REPORTER] WOULD THERE BE ANY GUARANTEES FOR HIS PARTICIPATION?

   [D'AUBUISSON] DIDN'T I JUST TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST MANGY DOGS,
UNGO AND ZAMORA, ARE ALREADY HERE?  WE DO HAVE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS; THERE
IS A WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS.  NOW, IF THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IT, THAT IS A
DIFFERENT STORY.  I AM JUST TELLING YOU ABOUT THE FIRST INDICATIONS WE HAVE
HAD, IN ADDITION TO SOME NOTES ON THE ELECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT BY SOME
WHO CLAIM TO BE COMMANDERS.  THE OVERALL PICTURE HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT IN THE
LAST FEW YEARS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THAT CHANGE, MAJOR?  

   [D'AUBUISSON] IN PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE NOTES THEY [THE FMLN
COMMANDERS] HAVE SENT, INCLUDING THE ONES SENT PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS,
THEY SAID THAT IF THE ELECTIONS WERE POSTPONED THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE.
THAT IS AN INDICATION THAT THEY DO HAVE PLANS TO JOIN THE PROCESS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, MAJOR?   

   [D'AUBUISSON] IT MEANS TWO BASIC THINGS:  ONE, THEY ARE LOST.  THE OPTION
TO SEIZE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS NO LONGER EXISTS.  

   [REPORTER] IN OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE LOST IN THE MILITARY FIELD?  

   [D'AUBUISSON] THEY ARE LOST BOTH IN THE MILITARY FIELD AND IN
THE OPTION TO SEIZE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS.  SECOND, THEY NO LONGER
HAVE THE SUPPORT, AND WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THAT FOR SOME TIME NOW.  THERE
IS NO LONGER ANY SUPPORT FOR THIS TYPE OF REBEL MOVEMENT, FOR THIS TYPE OF
ARMED REBEL MOVEMENT TO SEIZE POWER.

   [REPORTER] YOU MEAN SUPPORT FROM THE USSR?  

   [D'AUBUISSON] THERE IS NO SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNIST WORLD IN
GENERAL.  NATURALLY, THIS IS BASED VERY MUCH ON THE SO-CALLED PERESTROYKA.
THEREFORE, THEY WILL HAVE TO JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BECAUSE OTHERWISE
THEY ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT.  IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE SHOOTING BULLETS
JUST FOR THE SAKE OF SHOOTING, THEY ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT OF EVERYTHING
AND EVERYONE.

   [REPORTER] THERE IS MUCH TALK HERE ABOUT FORMING AN INTERNAL OPPOSITION
FRONT; I BELIEVE THIS IS PART OF THE "EVERYONE AGAINST ARENA" CAMPAIGN.  DO
YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS AND THE LINE THIS INTERNAL FRONT MIGHT
FOLLOW?

   [D'AUBUISSON] WELL, NOT EXACTLY.  HOWEVER, IT IS LOGICAL THAT AN INTERNAL
POLITICAL FRONT COULD BE FORMED.  THAT WOULD BE A POLITICAL PROCESS WITHIN A
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  IT IS ALL RIGHT TO DO THAT.  THEY HAVE ALL THE RIGHT IN
THE WORLD TO DO THAT.

   NOW, THERE ARE SUBVERSIVE THOUGHTS.  WE ARE REFERRING TO THOSE BIG MANGY
DOGS WHO WANT TO TAKE THE FIRST STEPS IN JOINING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  ON
THE OTHER HAND, THEY ARE SUBVERSIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DISRUPTING PUBLIC
ORDER.  IF WHAT THEY WANT IS TO CAUSE HARM AND HINDER THE PROGRAMS PREPARED
BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIS CABINET, THEY ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT
ANYHOW.

   REMEMBER THAT VERY SIMPLE PHRASE I TOLD YOU AT THE BEGINNING.  THEY
CLAIM THAT IF ARENA FAILS, THEY ARE THE ALTERNATIVE.  THAT IS WHAT THE
GROUP OF UNGO, ZAMORA, AND ALL THOSE REALLY THINKS.  THERE IS ANOTHER
GREAT POSSIBILITY, AND THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN HERE:
ARENA WILL NOT FAIL.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL NOT FAIL.  HOWEVER,
THEY ARE GOING TO TRY ALL THE ILLEGAL, SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS THEY CAN TO
MAKE US FAIL.  [CONTINUED]

ONCE THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE RURAL AREAS,
HARASSMENTS AND ASSASSINATIONS BEGAN SO AS TO GET OUR ATTENTION. THIS
WAS BECAUSE THE COMMUNISTS KNOW THAT THE RURAL AREAS HAVE REACTED
FAVORABLY.  THEY HAVE ALREADY REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT WE ARE GOING
TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGRARIAN REFORM, WHICH
SHOULD BE PERMANENT.  THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS CAN BE MADE IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTION WITHOUT RESORTING TO
VIOLENCE.  THE AGRARIAN REFORM CAN BE PRODUCTIVE, AND THAT IS OUR
GOAL.  THE AGRARIAN REFORM IN OUR COUNTRY WILL BE MADE PRODUCTIVE.

   [REPORTER] THERE WERE REPORTS THAT PEASANTS WERE CONCERNED BECAUSE SIX
CASES HAD BEEN DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE LANDOWNERS AND THE LANDS WERE LEGALLY
TURNED OVER TO THE OWNERS.

   [D'AUBUISSON] I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE WERE SIX OR MORE CASES.  IF WE LOOK
AT IT FROM THE LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, SERIOUS MISTAKES WERE MADE WHEN THE
LANDS WERE VIOLENTLY OCCUPIED.  MANY LANDS WERE IMPROPERLY OCCUPIED.  WE
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THIS.  WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS
FOR THESE PEOPLE.  IF THEY CANNOT STAY ON THOSE LANDS, THEY CAN TAKE OTHER
LANDS, BECAUSE THERE ARE ABOUT 33 LAND TRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY
ABANDONED.  REFUGEES AND ARMY FAMILIES MAY BE BROUGHT TO THOSE REGIONS.
EVEN THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH OUR AGRARIAN REFORM PLAN CAN GO THERE.  NO ONE
WILL BE ABANDONED.

   [REPORTER] WHERE ARE THOSE 33 LAND TRACTS?  

   [D'AUBUISSON] IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   [REPORTER] IN GENERAL TERMS, AND TO END THIS INTERVIEW, DO YOU BELIEVE
THIS 5-YEAR PERIOD WILL BE ONE OF PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT IN EL SALVADOR?  

   [D'AUBUISSON] YES, AND WE ARE SURE THAT WE WILL WIN THE ELECTIONS IN THE
FIRST ROUND IN 1994.  IN THIS 5-YEAR PERIOD WE WILL ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF
HAVING AN HONEST GOVERNMENT AND OF BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS OURSELVES
DEMOCRATICALLY.  THERE WILL BE PRODUCTIVITY AND THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR
WILL ONCE AGAIN FEEL PROUD OF BEING SALVADORANS.  WE WILL NO LONGER NEED
OTHERS TO DONATE THINGS TO US BECAUSE WE CAN PRODUCE THEM HERE.  WE WILL
CONTINUE WORKING TO RESCUE THIS SHIP SO THAT IT CAN SAIL EFFICIENTLY.

   [REPORTER] MAJOR, WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR VISITING US TODAY AND FOR
DISCUSSING ALL OF THE ISSUES WE COVERED.  IT HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO LISTEN
TO YOUR POINTS OF VIEW AND THOSE OF YOUR PARTY REGARDING THE VARIOUS ISSUES.

   [D'AUBUISSON] THANK YOU.  THIS HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW.  I WILL
ALWAYS BE WILLING TO COME BACK HERE AND TALK TO YOU AGAIN.

"COMPTROLLER" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS CAPTURED BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES
TODAY DURING THE RAID ON A FARM IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, IT WAS
REPORTED IN BOGOTA.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE ARREST OF MARTINEZ ROMERO, THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE
SINCE THE ARMY AND POLICE LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING
MAFIA LAST SATURDAY, OCCURRED ON A FARM NEAR TOLU MUNICIPALITY IN SUCRE
DEPARTMENT.

   ABOUT 24 PEOPLE WERE ALSO ARRESTED ALONG WITH THE MEDELLIN CARTEL
MEMBER.  THE CARTEL IS THE LARGEST WORLD COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION,
WHICH STAGED A SERIES OF VIOLENT ACTIONS LAST WEEK.

   IN FACT, MERCENARIES OF THAT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION ASSASSINATED IN LESS
THAN 48 HOURS, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA, ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER
COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, AND SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL
LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WHO ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, WAS THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED
VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS AS PRESIDENT.

   MARTINEZ ROMERO, ONE OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS MOST WANTED BY THE U.S. DRUG
ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION (DEA), HAD MANAGED TO EVADE A PLAN TO CAPTURE HIM
IN PANAMA CITY LAST 29 MARCH.

   UNOFFICIAL REPORTS IN BOGOTA INDICATE THAT THE WELL-KNOWN MAFIA MEMBER
COULD BE THE FIRST TO BE EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES, IN KEEPING WITH
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S NEW PROVISIONS ADOPTED IN VIEW OF THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE.  THESE PROVISIONS AUTHORIZE THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO
OTHER COUNTRIES WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE JUSTICE TRIBUNALS.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, MORE THAN 11,000 PEOPLE RELATED TO THE
MAFIA HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE INTENSE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE
COLOMBIAN ARMY AND POLICE, IN THE LARGEST OFFENSIVE EVER LAUNCHED BY
COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS.

   THE ACTIONS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT ESPECIALLY IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF
ANTIOQUIA, CUNDINAMARCA, AND VALLE DEL CAUCA, WHERE SO-CALLED ELITE PATROLS
HAVE TAKEN OVER EXTENSIVE AND SWANK PROPERTIES OWNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR
GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE "DRUG LORDS" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.

SESSION.  THE OAS ALSO EXPRESSED ITS "CONSTERNATION OVER AND REPUDIATION OF"
THE RECENT TERRORIST ACTIONS IN THAT COUNTRY, AND STRESSED THE "INDOMITABLE
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DECISION TO FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND RELATED
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES."

   THE OAS HELD A "SPECIAL AND URGENT" SESSION TODAY AT THE REQUEST OF
COLOMBIAN AMBASSADOR LEOPOLDO VILLAR, WHO WANTED TO DIRECTLY INFORM HIS
COLLEAGUES IN THAT ORGANIZATION ABOUT THE VIOLENT EVENTS IN HIS COUNTRY.

   IN HIS SPEECH, THE ARGENTINE DELEGATE REPUDIATE THE CRIMINAL ATTACKS THAT
ARE MEANT TO THREATEN MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIA'S JUDICIAL BRANCH, ESPECIALLY
THE MURDERS OF CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA, COLONEL VALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO,
AND SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO.

   ACCORDING TO THE TEXT OF THE SPEECH -- RELEASED TONIGHT BY THE FOREIGN
MINISTRY IN BUENOS AIRES -- THE ARGENTINE REPRESENTATIVES CONDEMNED "THOSE
TERRORIST ACTIONS THAT, IN ATTACKING DEMOCRACY AND THE STATE OF LAW, VIOLATE
THE PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE OAS CHARTER AND ALL OTHER INSTRUMENTS
OF THE SYSTEM ORGANIZED TO DEFEND AND STRENGTHEN THOSE PRINCIPLES."

   IN EXPRESSING THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA
AGAINST WHAT THEY CALLED "THIS TRAGIC SITUATION," THE ARGENTINE DELEGATES
STATED THAT THE PROBLEM AFFECTING COLOMBIA "IS A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE
CONTINENT, BECAUSE, AS IT HAS BEEN CORRECTLY STATED, THE WORLD OF DRUG
TRAFFICKING HAS NO BORDERS OR FRONTIERS."

   THE ARGENTINE DELEGATION ALSO STATED THAT THE SOLIDARITY OF THE OAS
MEMBERS MUST BE EXPRESSED THROUGH "A CONDEMNATION OF ALL TYPES OF VIOLENCE
AND OF ALL CRIMINAL TERRORISM."

   IT MUST ALSO BE EXPRESSED THROUGH "THE ACTIONS INTENDED TO VIGOROUSLY
DEFEND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY, OF WHICH COLOMBIA IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE, THE
ESSENTIAL RIGHTS OF MAN, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE IN THE CONTINENT."

   THE OAS RESOLUTION ALSO REITERATES THE MEMBER COUNTRIES' CONDEMNATION OF
ALL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE CONSUMPTION, PRODUCTION, AND TRAFFICKING OF
DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES.

   IT ALSO REAFFIRMS THE COMMITMENT TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF THE RIO DE JANEIRO PROGRAM FOR INTER-AMERICAN ACTION AND THE
GUATEMALA DECLARATION (ALLIANCE OF THE AMERICAS AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING).

   THE AMBASSADORS TO THE OAS ALSO REAFFIRMED THEIR INTENTION "TO INTENSIFY
THE PREPARATION FOR THE MEETING OF MINISTERS FROM ALL MEMBER COUNTRIES, WITH
THE GOAL OF REEVALUATING THE CURRENT STATE OF THE DRUG PROBLEM AND ADOPTING
CONCRETE MEASURES TO ERADICATE THIS PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL."

ANTICIPATE WHAT MEASURES WOULD BE TAKEN BY PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA'S

ECUADOR TO ESTABLISH THEIR OPERATION CENTERS, AND IT HAS BEEN NOTICED THAT
ECUADORAN PORTS ARE BEING USED INCREASINGLY TO SHIP DRUGS TO THE UNITED

SUCCESS OF THE ARMED FORCES' OPERATIONS" AND THAT HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE
FLOW OF INFORMATION WOULD ALLOW NEW VICTORIES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS.

   MEANWHILE, A HUNDRED AIRCRAFT OF ALL TYPES WERE BEING INSPECTED WITH DOGS
TRAINED TO DETECT DRUGS AT THE EL DORADO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN BOGOTA
TONIGHT. THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS DIRECTORATE HAS ADVISED ALL THE AIRCRAFT
OWNERS THAT THEY MUST PROVE THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY LINKS TO DRUG
TRAFFICKING WITHIN THE NEXT 7 DAYS.

   THE SAME OFFICE HAS REPORTED THAT THE SAME MEASURE WILL BE APPLIED TO
OTHER AIRPORTS IN THE COUNTRY IN THE COMING HOURS.

   CONCLUDING, THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED A DECREE TONIGHT THAT GOES INTO
IMMEDIATE EFFECT.  THE DECREE AUTHORIZES MILITARY AND POLICE OFFICIALS TO
SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT THAT OPERATE WITHOUT
THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE COMMUNICATIONS MINISTRY.  THE EQUIPMENT IS TO BE
CONFISCATED AND SENT TO THE SAID MINISTRY.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 23 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] STEPPING UP
SURVEILLANCE ALONG THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA AND PRESIDENT CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ' WARNING THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING MUST
BE STRENGTHENED ARE VENEZUELA'S VISIBLE REACTIONS TO THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF
LIBERAL PARTY LEADER LUIS CARLOS GALAN.

   MEANWHILE, IT WAS LEARNED THAT EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, RECENTLY ARRESTED
IN COLOMBIA AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCES, WAS TRYING TO PURCHASE LAND IN VENEZUELA TO
EXPAND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION.

   ACCORDING TO PEREZ, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS COULD BE MOVED
TO VENEZUELAN TERRITORY.  THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT STRESSED THE NEED TO
ADOPT STRONG MEASURES AGAINST SUCH A POSSIBILITY.  "THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE
MUST UNITE IN THIS BATTLE," THE HEAD OF STATE SAID.  HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT
VENEZUELA WILL SUPPORT COLOMBIA BY STEPPING UP SURVEILLANCE ALONG THE BORDER.

   IN THIS SENSE, VENEZUELAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL FILMO LOPEZ UZCATEGUI
ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF "TASK FORCES" THAT WILL BE DEPLOYED ALONG
VENEZUELA'S WESTERN BORDER.  THESE TASK FORCES WILL CARRY OUT INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES AND SUPPORT THE MILITARY UNITS STATIONED IN THE AREA.

   THE MINISTER REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF PARAMILITARY PERSONNEL BEING
RECRUITED TO FORM THE "TASK FORCES" AND ADDED THAT INCIDENTS LIKE THE ONE
THAT OCCURRED IN EL AMPARO ON THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA LAST YEAR WHEN A
GROUP OF SOLDIERS MURDERED 17 FISHERMEN WILL NOT BE REPEATED.

   "WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY TO
CONTINUE THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, THE MINISTER SAID.

   ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS MADE BY SOURCES STATIONED ALONG THE COLOMBIAN -
VENEZUELAN BORDER, AND CARRIED IN TODAY'S EDITION OF EL NACIONAL, MEDELLIN
CARTEL TREASURER MARTINEZ ROMERO WANTED TO BUY LAND IN ZULIA AND TACHIRA,
TWO VENEZUELAN STATES, TO EXPAND THE ORGANIZATION'S CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES.

   ACCORDING TO ZULIA STATE GOVERNOR ISMAEL ORDAZ, THE SECURITY CORPS HAVE
BEEN ALERTED IN LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKING "CAPOS"
MAY HAVE FLED INTO VENEZUELA AS A RESULT OF THE PERSECUTION UNLEASHED IN
COLOMBIA FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN ON 18 AUGUST.

   BOGOTA, 23 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] THE
GOVERNMENT'S STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DRUG CARTELS CONTINUES.  THE
OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE AUTHORITIES IN MEDELLIN HAVE RESULTED IN
70 RAIDS.  HOUSES, FARMS, DISCOTHEQUES, AND APARTMENTS REPORTEDLY
OWNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY THE AUTHORITIES;
921 PERSONS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, 2 OF WHOM FACE CHARGES THAT MERIT
THEIR EXTRADITION.

   THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN
ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT.  HOURS AFTER LEARNING ABOUT THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY
THE GOVERNMENT TO COUNTER DRUG TRAFFICKERS, REGIONAL AUTHORITIES LAUNCHED A
LARGE-SCALE PLAN TO CARRY OUT RAIDS AND CONFISCATIONS, AND TO SET UP ROAD
BLOCKS.

   TWENTY-TWO PROPERTIES -- INCLUDING FARMS, DISCOTHEQUES, BUILDINGS, AND
RESTAURANTS -- WERE SEIZED UNDER THE CHARGES THAT THEY WERE OWNED BY MEMBERS
OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.  THE MOST OUTSTANDING CASES INCLUDE THE MONACO
BUILDING -- WHICH WAS ALMOST DESTROYED DURING A DYNAMITE ATTACK LAST YEAR,
WAS BEING REPAIRED, AND HAD PRACTICALLY BEEN RESTORED TO ITS FORMER SPLENDOR
-- GAMA BUILDING, INTERNATIONAL DISCOTHEQUE, CAMA SUELTA DISCOTHEQUE
FORTALEZA DEL LAURO DISCOTHEQUE, AND DON MATEO DISCOTHEQUE, UNDOUBTEDLY THE
MOST LUXURIOUS IN THE CITY.

   SEVERAL FARMS WERE ALSO SEIZED, INCLUDING EL BIZCOCHO FARM, WHERE SEVERAL
WEAPONS CACHES WERE FOUND, AND LAS AGUILAS FARM, BECAUSE THE VALUE OF ITS
FURNITURE AND APPLIANCES SURPASS 3 BILLION PESOS.  THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC
IN ALL THE CONFISCATED PROPERTIES IS THEIR LUXURY AND ECCENTRICISM, THUS
MAKING THEIR TOTAL VALUE INCALCULABLE.

   THE AUTHORITIES ALSO SEIZED WEAPONS, VEHICLES, AND COMMUNICATIONS
EQUIPMENT.  THE FIRST REPORT INDICATES 921 PERSONS WERE ARRESTED BUT THE
FIGURE COULD BE HIGHER, GIVEN THE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT IN RECENT HOURS.
THE ARRESTED PERSONS INCLUDE TWO WHO REPORTEDLY FACE ENOUGH CHARGES TO
GUARANTEE THEIR EXTRADITION.

   MEANWHILE, ANOTHER PERSON HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH
INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS.  SHE IS ANA ELENA BEATRIZ
RODRIGUEZ, WHO IS THE THIRD EXTRADITABLE PERSON SOUGHT BY U.S.  AUTHORITIES
IN CONNECTION WITH MONEY LAUNDERING.  SHE WAS CAPTURED IN CARTAGENA.

   THE COLOMBIAN ARMY'S RAIDS ON PROPERTIES REPORTEDLY OWNED BY DRUG
TRAFFICKERS STILL CONTINUE.  TWO NEW FARMS LOCATED WITHIN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE
IN PALMIRA MUNICIPALITY JURISDICTION WERE RECENTLY SEIZED BY THE ARMED
FORCES.  LA RUIZA FARM, A SYNONYM FOR OSTENTATION AND LUXURY, IS A
RECREATION CENTER OWNED, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, BY RAMIRO CORREA.
PEOPLE VISITING THE FARM COULD ENJOY THE POOLS, SURROUNDED BY LUXURY RUGS,
JACUZZIS, A TENNIS COURT, BARS, EXOTICALLY DECORATED BEDROOMS, AND A
FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVING ROOM.

   THE AUTHORITIES SEIZED A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS, COMMUNICATION
EQUIPMENT, BULLET-PROOF VESTS, AMMUNITION FOR RIFLES, GRENADES BROUGHT FROM
ISRAEL, MILITARY UNIFORMS, AND INFRA-RED SIGHTS -- WHICH NOT EVEN THE ARMY
HAS -- AT EL ROSAL FARM, LOCATED
 IN THE AREA OF POTRERILLOS.  THE AUTHORITIES ALSO SEIZED MOTORCYCLES
SMUGGLED INTO THE COUNTRY.  MOST OF THE VALLEY WAS VISIBLE FROM A LOOKOUT
TOWER, PROBABLY FOR SECURITY REASONS OR FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES.  THE
MAIN ATTRACTION AT THE FARM WERE TRAINED HIGH- STEPPING COLOMBIAN HORSES.
THE OWNERS OF THESE FARMS HAVE YET TO BE ARRESTED, AND THERE IS STILL NO
INFORMATION ON THEIR WHEREABOUTS.  THE VALUE OF THESE PROPERTIES IS
CALCULATED IN MORE THAN 100 BILLION PESOS.

   THE AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO DEAL BLOWS TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN
ATLANTICO DEPARTMENT.  BERNARDO LONDONO QUINTERO, A NATIVE OF PEREIRA AND
ACCUSED OF BEING A MEMBER OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS CAPTURED EARLY THIS
MORNING NORTH OF BARRANQUILLA.  THE AUTHORITIES ARE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING
LONDONO'S ACTIVITIES BECAUSE HE IS APPARENTLY SOUGHT BY THE U.S.
AUTHORITIES.  FURTHERMORE, THE BARRANQUILLA AUTHORITIES HAVE ARRESTED
ALBERTO ORLANDES GAMBOA, A 34-YEAR-OLD NATIVE OF BARRANQUILLA WHO IS
CONSIDERED ANOTHER EXTRADITABLE PERSON. THE AUTHORITIES CONFISCATED HIS
WINE-COLORED TOYOTA LAND CUISER AND A BROWNING 9-MM PISTOL.S EVERAL RAIDS ARE
CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IN NORTHERN BARRANQUILLA AT RESIDENCES PRESUMABLY OWNED
BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

TRUJILLO WAS UNANIMOUSLY PROCLAIMED TODAY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR
THE NEW LIBERALISM [MOVEMENT WITHIN THE LIBERAL PARTY].

   GAVIRIA, WHO BECAME ONE OF THE MAJOR CONTENDERS FOR THE PRESIDENCY
OVERNIGHT, SPOKE TODAY.

   GAVIRIA EXPERIENCED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS OF HIS POLITICAL
CAREER WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED CANDIDATE OF THE NEW LIBERALISM MOVEMENT.  IT
IS ALSO PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE BECAUSE
HE RECEIVED THE BANNERS OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WHO WAS KILLED LAST FRIDAY.
HE SAID THE DEATH OF THE LEADER CANNOT BE USED TO ELIMINATE THE SYSTEM OF
CONSULTING WITH THE PEOPLE, WHICH WAS HIS GREATEST POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENT.
HE SAID FORMER PRESIDENT JULIO CESAR TURBAY AYALA IS WILLING TO ISSUE
SPECIAL A RESOLUTION TO ALLOW THE REGISTRATION OF THE NEW CANDIDACY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GAVIRIA] IF YOU ALL SUPPORT ME IN THIS EFFORT, IN THE
MIDST OF THIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY, IN THE MIDST OF THE CRISIS IN OUR
INSTITUTION THAT IS ENDANGERING OUR DEMOCRACY, I AM SURE JUST AS YOU ARE
THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL.  I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTIONS,
BUT I AM TALKING ABOUT MAKING COLOMBIA SUCCESSFUL.  LUIS CARLOS GALAN WILL
GUIDE US FROM HEAVEN SO THAT WE CAN MAKE COLOMBIA BETTER. [END RECORDING] 

   HE SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH HE IS AFRAID HE WILL STILL GO OUT TO PUBLIC
PLACES TO FIGHT TERRORISM.  HE SAID HE IS WILLING TO RESPECT THE RULES OF
THE GAME OF THE NEW LIBERALISM.  GAVIRIA WILL NOW HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO
APPOINT MEMBERS OF HIS CAMPAIGN.

   EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT EASY FOR SOME OF GALAN'S FRIENDS TO ACCEPT THE NEW
LEADER OF THEIR MOVEMENT, THEY KNOW THAT GALAN IS NO LONGER HERE, AND
GAVIRIA IS THE NEW LEADER.

SINECURES, AND TRIPS ABROAD.

   6.  THE ACTIONS OF CONFISCATION ARE NOTHING NEW; THEY HAVE ALWAYS

IMPRISONED, EVEN THOUGH NO ARREST WARRANTS HAD BEEN ISSUED AGAINST THEM, AND
MANY OF OUR PROPERTIES AND POSSESSIONS WERE ARBITRARILY CONFISCATED OR

   7.  COLOMBIAN CITIZENS CHARGED WITH MONEY LAUNDERING HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED
AND WILL BE EXTRADITED, ALTHOUGH THIS REPRESENTS A VIOLATION OF COLOMBIAN

WILL NOT LOWER OUR GUARD AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR STRUGGLE AND WIDESPREAD
WAR AGAINST TRAITORS AND TURNCOATS.

   9.  WE DECLARE A WIDESPREAD AND TOTAL WAR ON THE GOVERNMENT, THE

   BOGOTA, 24 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] AS A
RESULT OF COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER,
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' SECURITY IN PUBLIC APPEARANCES HAS BECOME A
MAJOR ISSUE.

   FOLLOWING ARE THE MINIMUM SECURITY MEASURES THAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SAVE THEIR LIVES WHEN
ENDANGERED.

   FROM NOW ON SUPPORTERS OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT
THEY WILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE FOLLOWING SECURITY MEASURES DURING THEIR
CANDIDATES' PUBLIC APPEARANCES.

   MEASURES FOR CANDIDATES 

   1. ALL CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO PLACE THEMSELVES IN THE HANDS OF
THEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS, IN OTHER WORDS TO THEIR CHIEF ESCORT.  THE
CHIEF ESCORT AND THE CANDIDATE WILL JOINTLY PLAN EACH TOUR AND WILL
PROGRAM ALL MOVEMENTS IN DETAIL AND FOLLOW THE PROGRAM TO THE LETTER.

   THE CANDIDATE MUST INFORM THE CHIEF ESCORT OF HIS AGENDA AND OF ANY
THREAT OR INDICATION OF DANGER HE RECEIVES.  THE CANDIDATE MUST USE HIS
ESCORTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR HIS PROTECTION AND FOR NO OTHER USE.

   2. A CANDIDATE'S ESCORTS MUST KNOW THE CANDIDATE'S BLOODTYPE, HIS
ILLNESSES, AND WHICH MEDICINE HE TAKES.  THE ESCORTS MUST ALSO KNOW THE
NAMES OF THE CANDIDATE'S CLOSEST FRIENDS.

   3. THE CANDIDATE MUST LEARN WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  HIS
ESCORTS WILL TEACH HIM WHAT TO DO.

   4. NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE CANDIDATES CHANGE THEIR PLANS AT THE
LAST MINUTE.  THE CANDIDATE MUST NOT FALL INTO A ROUTINE.  HE MUST CHANGE
ROUTES, SCHEDULES, AND PROGRAMS ALWAYS IN CONSULTATION WITH HIS CHIEF ESCORT.

   5. THE CANDIDATE MUST ALWAYS HAVE A DOCTOR IN HIS GROUP.  

   6. EACH CANDIDATE WILL HAVE TO BEAR AN EXTRA BURDEN.  HE WILL HAVE
TO WEAR A HEAVY AND SUFFOCATING BULLET-PROOF VEST.  SUPPORTERS, PLEASE
TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

   7. A PUBLIC RALLY IN AN OPEN PLACE AT NIGHT CAN BE DEADLY FOR YOUR
CANDIDATE.  PLEASE EXCLUDE ANY SUCH RALLIES FROM YOUR PLANS.

   8. SAY NO TO THE USE OF FIRECRACKERS AND POWDER KEGS DURING
DEMONSTRATIONS.  SUCH THINGS CONFUSE ESCORTS AND SECURITY CORPS.

   9. SUPPORTERS, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT CROWDS WHO WANT TO SHAKE
CANDIDATES' HANDS OR TOUCH THEM CAN BE DEADLY.  ESCORTS SHOULD NOT ALLOW
SUCH THINGS.

   10. CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR WALKS IN PUBLIC PLACES AND REDUCE
THEIR SOCIAL ACTIVITIES TO THE MINIMUM.  CANDIDATES WILL VISIT THEIR FRIENDS
AT UNUSUAL HOURS.

   THIS IS HOW SECURITY WILL BE HANDLED FROM NOW ON.  ALL THESE MEASURES
HAVE TURNED CANDIDATES INTO MEN WITH LIMITATIONS.  THEIR SUPPORTERS MUST
UNDERSTAND THEIR CANDIDATES' SITUATION.  CANDIDATES ARE MEN UNDER THE
DICTATORSHIP OF THEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS WHO LOOK AFTER THEIR SAFETY IN TIMES
OF RAGE.

   NO CITY (ISRAEL), 25 AUG 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH NETANYAHU BY
FRIEDMAN AND DAN] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [FRIEDMAN] YOU MUST KNOW BETTER
THAN I THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ITSELF, AND NOT ONLY INDIVIDUAL
ISRAELI NATIONALS, ARE ACCUSED OF MAKING SECURITY-RELATED DEALS WITH
VARIOUS REGIMES WHICH -- TO THE CIVILIZED WESTERN WORLD, AT LEAST --
APPEAR TO BE OF QUESTIONABLE REPUTE.  WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA THAT GUIDE
ISRAEL'S ACTIONS AS A STATE AND WHEN ISSUING PERMITS TO PRIVATE
COMPANIES TO MAKE DEALS WITH SUCH COUNTRIES?

   [NETANYAHU] I WILL NOT GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS CRITERIA
DETERMINED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WHICH ARE OFTEN RELATED TO OUR OWN
DEFENSE ISSUES.  ONE CRITERION, HOWEVER, IS CLEAR:  WE DO NOT ALLOW
COOPERATION WITH ELEMENTS WHICH ARE NOT STATE-AFFILIATED, SUCH AS CARTELS,
GROUPS, OR GANGS.  ALL THESE ARE OFF LIMITS.  THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT
THAT, AND NO GREY AREAS.  THEREFORE, IF THE REPORTS FROM COLOMBIA ARE TRUE,
THE PEOPLE ACTED COUNTER TO OUR POLICY AND IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW.

   [FRIEDMAN] WHAT ABOUT WORKING WITH OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS TO CERTAIN
REGIMES?

   [NETANYAHU] I REPEAT:  STATE MOVEMENTS ONLY, OR, LET US SAY, STATE
REGIMES.  THIS IS OUR POLICY.  ANY OTHER ACTION RUNS COUNTER TO OUR POLICY.

   [DAN] WHEN ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG TRAFFICKING IN COLOMBIA IS
MENTIONED, DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF ISRAELIS REFERRED TO?  PERHAPS THE
STATEMENT IS EXAGGERATED, AND THERE ARE NO MORE THAN ONE OR TWO, PERHAPS
THREE ISRAELIS?

   [NETANYAHU] THAT IS A GOOD POINT; REPORTS ARE SO OFTEN BLOWN OUT OF
PROPORTION.  WE SEEM TO HAVE SOME KIND OF REPUTATION WHICH OFTEN LEADS TO
EXAGGERATED AND FANTASTIC -- I DO NOT WISH TO USE THE TERM ROMANTIC --
REPORTS IN THIS CONTEXT.  IN ANY EVENT, THERE ARE MANY REPORTS, AND WE WOULD
LIKE TO GET TO THE CORE OF TRUTH BEHIND THEM.  AFTER THAT, WE WILL DECIDE
WHAT ACTION WE CAN TAKE.  WE MAY TAKE LEGAL STEPS, TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S
PASSPORTS, AND RESORT TO OTHER METHODS.

   [FRIEDMAN] IN THE PAST, MR NETANYAHU, YOU BELONGED TO AN ARMY UNIT IN
WHICH OUR FINEST YOUNG PEOPLE SERVED.  HAVE YOU FOUND FORMER ARMY FRIENDS IN
ANY OF THE MENTIONED NAMES?

   [NETANYAHU] NO, AND I HOPE NEVER TO FIND ANY.  

   [DAN] DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE PHENOMENON?  

   [NETANYAHU] IF IT EXISTS! 

   [FRIEDMAN] YES, IF IT EXISTS.  OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION IS
SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISO, BECAUSE WE HAVE NO SOLID GROUNDS FOR DISCUSSION.

   [NETANYAHU] IF IT EXISTS, I THINK IT REFLECTS THE MORAL CORRUPTION OF A
FEW INDIVIDUALS.  THE STATE CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT EACH OF ITS
NATIONALS DOES OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  THESE PEOPLE MAY HAVE SUCCUMBED TO
MERCENARY OR OTHER TEMPTATIONS.  THE EXPRESSION OF SELLING ONE'S SOUL TO THE
DEVIL IS APPROPRIATE IN THEIR CASE.

   [FRIEDMAN] DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER BINYAMIN NETANYAHU, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.  

   [NETANYAHU] THANK YOU.

   BOGOTA, 25 AUG 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE SINISTER EXTRADITABLES GROUP TODAY
THREATENED TO KILL 10 JUDGES FOR EVERY COLOMBIAN WHO IS EXTRADITED TO THE
UNITED STATES.  THIS IS A WARNING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO WHO HAS ANNOUNCED THAT INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN BE
EXTRADITED.

   THE CLANDESTINE GROUP, WHICH EARLY THIS MORNING SET FIRE TO THE LLANO
GRANDE COUNTRY CLUB IN RIONEGRO MUNICIPALITY, 40 KM NORTH OF MEDELLIN, SENT
A LETTER TODAY TO OMAR GARCES, FIRST SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE OF CALI, INFORMING
HIM OF THE THREAT TO KILL 10 JUDGES FOR EVERY PERSON EXTRADITED.

   GARCES, WHO IS ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF JUDICIAL OFFICIALS IN
VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT, SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES SENT SEVERAL
MESSAGES WITH THE THREAT TO VARIOUS JUDICIAL OFFICES IN THAT AREA OF THE
COUNTRY, LOCATED 500 KM FROM BOGOTA.

   AS A RESULT OF THE EXTRADITABLES' THREAT, THE JUDGES ARE HOLDING A
MEETING TO WEIGH THE SITUATION AND DETERMINE THE VERACITY OF THE WARNING.
HOWEVER, THEY DECIDED THEY WILL NOT STOP WORKING.

   "THE TIME HAS COME TO UNITE AROUND THE COUNTRY'S FLAG TO RECOVER
COLOMBIA'S DIGNITY AND TO PREVENT ITS BAD SONS FROM CONTINUING TO SHAME IT
BEFORE THE WORLD," JUDGE GARCES SAID.  HE ALSO ASKED FOR PROTECTION FOR
HIMSELF AND THE OTHER JUDGES IN THAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY.

INVESTIGATIVE POLICE HAVE DEALT A HARD BLOW TO DRUG TRAFFICKING BY
ARRESTING FOUR PERUVIAN CITIZENS WHO ENTERED CHILE ACROSS THE NORTHERN
BORDER WITH 2 KG OF COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE VALUED AT $160,000.

   THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE IDENTIFIED AS ROSA DEL CARMEN ZABALA, 35,

   THE FOUR TRAFFICKERS CARRIED THE COCAINE IN SEALED PACKAGES READY FOR
SALE IN LA SERENA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE PACKAGES WERE HELD IN

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (TCS TELEVISION) -- [INTERVIEW WITH CRISTIANI
BY KOBERG] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] WHEN MUCH TERRORIST VIOLENCE
IS CREATED AND WHEN MUCH STREET VIOLENCE IS CREATED, EVERYONE IS
ADVERSELY AFFECTED; WE BELIEVE THE ARMED FORCES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO
PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.  WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT PREVENTS
VIOLENCE, IT IS DOING A MORE PROFESSIONAL JOB THAN IF IT ALLOWED IT TO
TAKE PLACE, BECAUSE ONCE THE VIOLENCE GETS STARTED, THE CONSEQUENCES
OF THEIR ACTIONS MAY BE A LOT MORE UNFORTUNATE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE
POLICY OF TRYING TO PREVENT VIOLENT PLANS BEFORE THEY ARE CARRIED OUT
IS SOMETHING THAT HAS PRODUCED GOOD RESULTS.

   OF COURSE, THE PEOPLE SUSPECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES OF SUPPORTING THE
FMLN PLANS ARE ARRESTED AND TURNED OVER TO THE JUDGE ONCE THE EVIDENCE IS
GATHERED.  I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT.  UNFORTUNATELY MANY
OF THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED ARE LATER RELEASED.  MANY OF THEM TURN OUT TO BE
INNOCENT BECAUSE SUSPICIONS MAY TURN OUT TO BE FALSE AND THE JUDGE IS THERE
TO PREVENT MISTAKES FROM BEING COMMITTED.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES ARE
ACTING WITHIN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK.

   THERE ARE CASES SUCH AS MR MASARIEGO.  WHEN HE WAS RELEASED, IT WAS
CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM, AND WE HAVE HERE
DOCUMENTS PROVING THAT.  HOWEVER, HE TOURED THE UNITED STATES TO SHOW OFF
HIS BURNT KNEE AND TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN TORTURED HERE IN EL SALVADOR.  IT
HAD BEEN PROVEN THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS
RELEASED.  THE LEFT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES
ABROAD.  HOWEVER, I DO NO BELIEVE THE LEFT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

   [KOBERG] MR PRESIDENT, AN ANALYST WHO MET WITH US A SHORT TIME AGO GAVE
HIS OPINION ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE AND ITS RESULTS.  HE WAS NOT
VERY OPTIMISTIC AND HE SAID THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL POINTS THAT COULD BECOME
OBSTACLES TO THE DIALOGUE.  ONE OF THEM WAS THE ECONOMIC MEASURES.  HE SAID
THAT THE FMLN COULD NOT HOLD NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AS LONG AS THE
GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THE ECONOMIC MEASURES IT WAS IMPLEMENTING.  WE HAVE
LEARNED FROM THE FMLN COMMUNIQUES, WHICH ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO KEEP
IMPLEMENTING THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS AND OTHER SERIES OF POINTS
CONCERNING THE ECONOMIC MEASURES.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, WITHIN THIS
FRAMEWORK, WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATE OR WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT
UNDERSTAND BY NEGOTIATION?  COULD THERE BE POSSIBLE NEGOTIATION ON THE
ECONOMIC POLICY?

   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HERE IN OUR COUNTRY NO LONGER
HAS THAT GENERIC MEANING GIVEN BY THE DICTIONARY.  THIS WORD HAS BEEN
MANIPULATED BY LEFTIST FORCES IN THE SENSE THAT TO NEGOTIATE IS TO ACCEPT
WHAT THE FMLN WANTS.  ACCORDING TO THE LEFT, THAT IS WHAT NEGOTIATING
MEANS.  I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HAS A GENERIC MEANING.  A NEGOTIATION
IS TO TRY TO FIND JOINT AGREEMENTS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND THAT IS WHAT WE
HAVE BEEN PROPOSING.  WE HAVE SOUGHT AGREEMENTS ON THE LARGEST NUMBER OF
POINTS POSSIBLE.  LOGICALLY, NOT ALL POINTS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE OTHER
SIDE AND WE BELIEVE THE FMLN IS MAKING A MISTAKE WHEN IT THINKS IT WILL
NEGOTIATE ITS ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, OR SOCIAL PLATFORM WITH THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FMLN MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THEIR PLANS FOR THE
COUNTRY WITH THE PEOPLE.  THAT IS DONE BY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND BY SHOWING
THEIR PROPOSALS TO THE PUBLIC.  IF THE PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED THAT THEIR
PROPOSALS ARE BEST, THEY WILL GET THE VOTES AND THEY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO
IMPLEMENT THEIR PROGRAMS AND THEIR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS.

   IN THIS CASE, UNFORTUNATELY THEY DID NOT PARTICIPATE; IT WAS OUR PARTY
PLATFORM THAT WAS CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE.  THIS GIVES THE GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT
TO IMPLEMENT WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ASK OF THEM.

   WE DO NOT THINK THE FMLN SHOULD OPPOSE THIS OFFERING.  THE FMLN REFUSES
TO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND KEEPS LOOKING FOR EXCUSES AND SETTING
CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DEMANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECLARE ITSELF TEMPORARY
BEFORE ANY TALKS ARE CONSIDERED.  THEY KNOW THEY ARE ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE.
THEIR TRUE PURPOSE IS TO REFUSE TO TALK SERIOUSLY, WHICH THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE WANTS THEM TO DO.  LORENA, I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD CONFUSE THE
VARIOUS FACTORS INVOLVED.  HOLDING A DIALOGUE IS NOT EASY, AS POINTED OUT BY
THIS ANALYST, WHOSE NAME I DO NOT KNOW.  THE SITUATION IS NOT EASY TO
RESOLVE.  THIS PROCESS COULD WELL LAST MANY MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS.  IT IS
NECESSRY TO START NOW WITH A DIALOGUE IN WHICH BOTH SIDES BEGIN TO DISCUSS,
NOT WHAT THEY CANNOT AGREE ON, BUT WHAT WE CAN AGREE ON.  WE SHOULD BEGIN BY
TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE VIOLENCE THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY.  IF THEY FIND
THEY CANNOT AGREE ON SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD

   BOGOTA, 25 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] LAST
MINUTE REPORT: IN CONFUSING EVENTS, POLICE LIEUTENANT ALFREDO CORREA
AND ONE PRIVATE WERE KILLED IN VALLE DEPARTMENT.  NO FURTHER
INFORMATION ON THIS INCIDENT HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE, OTHER THAN THAT
AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING THE EVENT.

   IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT 10TH ARMY BRIGADE MEMBERS FOUND AND
CONFISCATED 2 METRIC TONS OF HIGH-GRADE COCAINE AT LA MONEDA FARM IN LECHI,
CAUCASIA, AT THE BORDER BETWEEN ANTIOQUIA AND CORDOBA DEPARTMENTS.  THE DRUG
WAS FOUND IN SEALED WATERPROOF PACKAGES IN UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. THIS MAKES
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE DRUG WAS READY TO BE AIR DROPPED OVER THE SEA TO BE
PICKED UP BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS. IN ADDITION, A LARGE NUMBER OF ARMS, A
SIZABLE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION, AS WELL AS AUTOMOBILES AND RADIO SETS WERE
CONFISCATED.  THE DRUG WAS SET ON FIRE IN THE PRESENCE OF JUDGES AND
MILITARY AUTHORITIES.  A CLANDESTINE LANDING STRIP WAS ALSO DESTROYED.

   ARSON SEEMS TO BE THE NEW CRIMINAL STYLE USED IN ANTIOQUIA.  IN LESS THAN
24 HOURS, FOUR FARMS HAVE BEEN SET ON FIRE.  THREE OF THESE FARMS, LOCATED
NEAR MEDELLIN, ARE OWNED BY POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL LEADERS EDGAR GUTIERREZ
CASTRO, IGNACIO VELEZ ESCOBAR, AND AUGUSTO LOPEZ.  THE MOST RECENT OF THESE
INCIDENTS OCCURRED AT THE LLANO GRANDE COUNTRY CLUB EARLY THIS MORNING.
SEVERAL ARMED MEN SHOWED UP AT THE SITE AND SET THE CLUB ON FIRE AFTER
THREATENING AND BEATING UP THE WATCHMEN.  THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSSES HAS NOT
YET BEEN DETERMINED.  THE MANAGER DID NOT ALLOW REPORTERS INTO THE PLACE.  IT
WAS REPORTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE ATTACKERS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS
EXTRADITABLES WHO SAID THE ACTION WAS BEING TAKEN IN REPRISAL FOR THE
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AGAINST THEM.  THE ARMED MEN LEFT THE PLACE SHOUTING THAT
THEIR REACTION HAS JUST BEGUN AND THAT THEIR STRUGGLE WILL CONTINUE.
FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE CLUB AND THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE WERE PREVENTED BY
WORKERS WHO REACTED PROMPTLY.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN MEASURES TO COUNTERACT THESE ACTIONS.
THE ARMY THIS AFTERNOON WILL RECEIVE THE INITIAL U.S.  TACTICAL SUPPORT AS
PART OF THE NEW ANTITERRORIST OFFENSIVE, GOVERNMENT SOURCES HAVE REPORTED.
U.S. MILITARY CARGO PLANES WILL FLY TO COLOMBIA ARMED TWIN-TURBINE BELL-212
HELICOPTERS.  IN ADDITION, THE PENTAGON WILL SHIP RADIO COMMUNICATIONS
EQUIPMENT.  THE HELICOPTERS WILL BE FLOWN BY COLOMBIAN MILITARY CREWS, U.S.
STATE DEPARTMENT SOURCES SAID IN WASHINGTON.  FOR THE TIME BEING, BOTH
GEORGE BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION AND VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT ARE NOT
CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF U.S. MILITARY MEN IN COLOMBIA.  

   OVER THE PAST 72 HOURS, THE ARMY RAIDED FIVE FARMS, ONE HOME, AND A
BAR-RESTAURANT OWNED BY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, CAMILO ZAPATA, AND PABLO
ESCOBAR GAVIRIA.  THE RAIDS WERE CONDUCTED BY 13TH BRIGADE TROOPS IN CHIA,
PACHO, AND BOGOTA.  THIS FARM, KNOWN AS EL CASTILLO DE MARROQUIN, OWNED BY
ZAPATA AND ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH MORE THAN 100 BILLION PESOS, WAS RAIDED ON
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.  ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, THIS VERITABLE FORTRESS,
LOCATED ON THE EL COMUN BRIDGE, WAS MANAGED BY RETIRED POLICE MAJOR ALVARO
TOVAR TOVAR.  LUXURIOUS CARS, A GOLD-ORNAMENTED CHAPEL, A SWIMMING POOL
FITTED WITH A HEATING SYSTEM, 15 STABLES WITH FINE HORSES, A TENNIS COURT,
AND THE IMPRESSIVE CASTLE ALL MAKE UP A FARM WORTH MILLIONS.  EXTENSIVE
GARDENS, LONG TRAILS, AND AN ATTRACTIVE LAKE COMPLEMENT THE WONDERFUL NATURAL
LANDSCAPE OF THE REAL ESTATE RIGHT BY THE BOGOTA NORTHERN FREEWAY.  THERE
ARE EXOTIC ADORNMENTS ON THE WALLS.  FOR INSTANCE, THERE IS A BOTERO
PAINTING WORTH 4 MILLION PESOS.  IN ONE ROOM, THERE WERE MANY ELECTRIC
APPLIANCES AND A FULL RADIO COMMUNICATIONS SET.  THE EXORBITANT WEALTH IS
INDICATED BY EVEN A WITCHCRAFT ROOM.  [CONTINUED]

ROBERTO NORDENFLYGHT FARIAS, WHO KILLED ARMY LIEUTENANT ROBERTO ZEGERS
REED IN AN ARMED CLASH IN SANTIAGO LAST SUNDAY, WAS AT THE TIME OF HIS
DEATH DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT [FPMR] AND
THE STEPSON OF COMMUNIST LEADER VOLODIA TEITELBOIM.

   IN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, THE CNI PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE SAYS THAT A
REVIEW OF THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED FROM NORDENFLYGHT'S HOME MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR
THE CNI TO CONCLUDE THAT HE WAS THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE FPMR, THE ARMED
BRANCH OF THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY [PCCH] 

   NORDENFLYGHT, WHO WAS KILLED BY A SENTRY IN THE ARMED CLASH AT THE
TOBALABA AIR FIELD AFTER KILLING LT ZEGERS, ASSUMED THE LEADERSHIP POSITION
WITHIN THE EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION IN SEPTEMBER 1988, THE CNI SAID.

   IN THIS CAPACITY, NORDEFLYGHT SUPERVISED A 21 OCTOBER ATTACK ON A POLICE
DETACHMENT AND RESIDENTS OF THE MOUNTAIN TOWNSHIP OF LOS QUENES, IN THE

   BRIDGETOWN (BARBADOS), 24 AUG 89 (CANA) -- [TEXT] WASHINGTON,
D.C.--THE BAHAMAS GOVERNMENT IS SUPPORTING COLOMBIA'S FIGHT ON ILLEGAL
DRUG TRAFFICKING. "THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM THE RECENT
EVENTS IN COLOMBIA. WE APPLAUD THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT FOR THE BOLD
STEPS HE IS TAKING, BUT WE MUST SHOW THE CARTELS THAT HE IS NOT
ALONE," BAHAMAS' FOREIGN MINISTER CHARLES CARTER SAID.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP THE FIGHT AGAINST THE TRAFFICKERS
FOLLOWING THE KILLING OF A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. CARTER SAID THAT "ALL OF
US IN THIS HEMISPHERE" MUST SHOW THE DRUG DEALERS THEY ARE "PART OF THE WAR".

   THE BAHAMAS WANTS TO HOST A MEETING THIS YEAR OF LEADERS OF THE
HEMISPHERE TO DEFINE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR WAGING AN ALL OUT WAR ON
THE PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, SHIPMENT, DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS.
CARTER TOLD CANA THAT RECENT EVENTS IN COLOMBIA DEMONSTRATED THE NEED FOR A
WELL PLANNED, COORDINATED AND IMPLEMENTED PROGRAM WHICH WOULD TACKLE ALL
ASPECTS OF THE DRUG PROBLEM. HE SAID HIS COUNTRY HOPED SUCH A SUMMIT COULD
BE HELD BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER TOLD CANA THAT HIS COUNTRY HAD INDICATED TO THE
UNITED STATES IN JANUARY A WILLINGNESS TO HOST THE SUMMIT BUT, TO DATE,
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION.  "WE DISCUSSED
THE IDEA OF THE SUMMIT AT THE CARICOM (CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY) FOREIGN
MINISTERS MEETING, THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING, AT THE ORGANIZATION OF
AMERICAN STATES (OAS) AND WE INFORMED THE UNITED STATES BY DIPLOMATIC NOTE
IN JANUARY OF OUR DESIRE TO HOST THE MEETING BUT SO FAR THE UNITED STATES
HAS NOT RESPONDED. WHETHER WE WOULD ULTIMATELY GO AHEAD WITH IT I'M NOT
SURE," CARTER EXPLAINED.

   CARTER WAS AGAINST USING UNITED STATES TROOPS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE
CARIBBEAN IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS, POINT OUT THAT "THE DEMOCRATIC
TRADITIONS IN SOME OF OUR COUNTRIES WOULD BE THREATENED IF WE WERE TO RESORT
TO THE USE OF FORCE." HE SAID ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS ONE BETWEEN HIS COUNTRY
AND THE UNITED STATES FOR JOINT POLICING COULD EXTENDED TO INVOLVE OTHER
COUNTRIES IN THE HEMISPHERE.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THREE QUARTERS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED ARE
CONSUMED IN NORTH AMERICA. "WE ARE NOT THE MARKETS.  COUNTRIES LIKE THE
BAHAMAS, JAMAICA, TRINIDAD, CUBA AND BARBADOS ARE ONLY USED BY THE DRUG
LORDS TO REACH THE 3 BILLION DOLLAR UNITED STATES MARKET," HE REMARKED. "WE
AREN'T REALLY THE TARGET AND THEREFORE WE MUST FOCUS ON THE QUESTION OF
DEMAND. AND WE IN CARICOM, AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE BAHAMAS, ARE READY TO BE
PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE UNITED STATES DRUG PROBLEM."

   CARTER SAID AMONG THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A SUMMIT WOULD BE "A JUDICIAL
ATMOSPHERE" THAT WOULD LET THE DRUG BARONS, DEALERS AND USERS "KNOW THAT
THEY ARE CRIMINALS WHEREVER THEY ARE OR WHEREVER THEY GO."

   HAVANA (CUBA), 22 AUG 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[MANOLO ORTEGA] [TEXT] THE FULL SCOPE OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE AND
DEATH THAT HAS SWAMPED COLOMBIA OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IS NOW
BEGINNING TO BE ASSESSED.  LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD
HAVE REMAINED ON THE SIDELINES OF THAT SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRY'S
DOMESTIC STRIFE, WHERE HUMAN LIFE IS ALMOST WORTHLESS.  VENEZUELAN
PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN HE TOLD
COLOMBIAN RADIO CARACOL THAT WE MAY NOT BE DOING WHAT WE MUST
CONCERNING CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN COLOMBIA.  CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IS
CONCERNED THAT SOME NATIONS MAY BE GETTING USED TO LIVNG IN A CLIMATE
OF COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION.

   DAILY EVENTS OCCUR IN COLOMBIA AMID A CLIMATE OF NATIONAL UNCERTAINTY.
BANDS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BUILT AN EMPIRE OF DIRTY MONEY AND
BLOODTHIRSTY MAFIAS IN DEATHLY COMPLICITY WITH THE MILITARY DEPLOYMENT OF
140 PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  YEARS AGO, WHEN THESE GROUPS ANNOUNCED THEIR GUNS
WERE AIMED AT PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST PERSONALITIES, THEY OPERATED WITH THE
UNSPOKEN COMPLICITY OF MANY SECTORS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, FOR
SOME TIME NOW, THE MURDER VICTIMS HAVE BEEN LEFTISTS, LIBERALS,
CONSERVATIVES, AND EVEN POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT PERSONS WHO OPPOSE THE CHAOS
CREATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS, LANDOWNERS, SOME OFFICERS, AND PARAMILITARY
GROUPS.  LUIS CARLOS GALAN, 46, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, LIBERAL SENATOR,
LAWYER, AND NEWSMEN IS THE LATEST VICTIM OF THIS DEATHLY SPIRIAL.  HIS
REMAINS [29-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] LUIS CARLOS GALAN.  DRUG
TRAFFICKERS HAVE SHOWN THEIR HIT LIST IS NEVERENDING.  THEY ALSO BRING TO
THE FORE THE POWER AND SCOPE OF THE DIRTY WAR THESE PEOPLE BEGAN IN THE
COUNTRY AMID THE GOVERNMENT'S INACTION.

   MANY WONDER HOW THE PARAMILITARY TOP COMMAND CAN GO UNPUNISHED,
CONSIDERING THAT ITS CHIEF LEADERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, BECAUSE MORE OFTEN
THAN NOT THE KILLERS DO VERY LITTLE TO COVER THEIR TRACKS.  LOOKING AHEAD,
THE COLOMBIAN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT WILL CONCLUDE IN NEXT YEAR'S ELECTIONS
HAS BEEN DEALT A HEAVY BLOW WITH GALAN'S MURDER.  THE REMAINING PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO CONDUCT THEIR POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SURROUNDED BY
ARMIES OF BODYGUARDS, AN ARRANGEMENT WIDELY USED IN COLOMBIA BY POLITICIANS,
LABOR LEADERS, JUDGES, ARTISTS, AND MINOR OFFICIALS.  PERPLEXITY OVER WHAT
HAPPENED IN COLOMBIA IS ONE OF THE INITIAL REACTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA.  LUIS
CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER ALSO CALLS FOR CONDEMNATION.  PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE IT
MAY HELP MAKE THE CONTINENT MEDITATE ON WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ADVISABLE TO BE
INDIFFERENT TO THE COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION THAT PREVAILS IN COLOMBIA.

UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND THE MURDER OF A PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN IN
GUATEMALA CITY THIS WEEK SHOOK THE COUNTRY AND UNLEASHED A WAVE OF
CRITICISM AGAINST THE VINICIO CEREZO ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE OF WHAT
CRITICS CALLED "ITS INABILITY TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO CITIZENS."

   SOME OF THE NEWSPAPER HEADLINES TODAY WERE: "RAMIRO CASTILLO'S MURDER
CONDEMNED," "CRIME AGAINST BUSINESSMAN CAUSES GENERAL INDIGNATION,"
"DEPUTIES ASK FOR END TO VIOLENCE," "THE BLOODBATH MUST STOP," AND "CALL FOR
GOVERNMENT MINISTER'S RESIGNATION."

   THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO DISAPPEARED THIS WEEK ARE VICTOR HUGO
RODRIGUEZ JARAMILLO, HIS WIFE, SILVIA MARIA AZURDIA UTRERA, IVAN ERNESTO
GONZALEZ FUENTES, CARLOS CONDE, AND HUGO GRAMAJO.

   THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, WHICH EMERGED FROM
THE ESQUIPULAS PEACE AGREEMENT, EXPRESSED ITS CONCERN TODAY OVER THE LATEST
VIOLENCE WHICH, IT SAID, IS EVIDENCE OF THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE
COUNTRY.

   THE COMMITTEE ASKED THAT THE LIVES OF THE KIDNAP VICTIMS BE RESPECTED AND
IT ADDED THAT SOME OF THEM WERE "ARRESTED BY THE SECURITY FORCES IN THE
CAPITAL AND THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR."

   RAMIRO CASTILLO, THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANCO INDUSTRIAL AND ONE OF THE
MOST PROMINENT GUATEMALAN BUSINESSMEN, WAS SHOT TO DEATH ON 24 AUGUST BY A
GROUP OF ARMED MEN WHO ENTERED HIS HOUSE IN SANTA CATARIAN PINULA, 30 KM
SOUTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL.

   THE AUTHORITIES SAID HE WAS KILLED WHEN HE TRIED TO PREVENT A THEFT FROM
OCCURRING IN HIS HOUSE BUT SOURCES CLOSE TO THE FAMILY RULED OUT THAT
POSSIBILITY.

   ONE OF CASTILLO'S CHILDREN, 23-YEAR-OLD RAMIRO, WAS ALSO WOUNDED IN THE
INCIDENT.

   CASTILLO'S MURDER CAUSED ANGER, ESPECIALLY IN THE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE
SECTOR.

   THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF FARMING, COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND
FINANCIAL ASSOCIATIONS (CACIF), WHICH HOUSES THE PRIVATE SECTOR
ORGANIZATIONS, BLAMED THE CEREZO ADMINISTRATION AND ESPECIALLY THE SECURITY
FORCES "FOR THEIR INABILITY TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO CITIZENS, AND IT ASKED
FOR GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO VALLE BALDIZAN'S RESIGNATION BECAUSE "HE HAS
OBVIOUSLY BEEN INCOMPETENT IN DOING HIS JOB."

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] 1.
ON SUNDAY 20 AUGUST, EIGHT FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] DISABLED WAR COMRADES OCCUPIED THE [SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN]
CATHEDRAL, WHERE THEY REMAIN STILL TO PROTEST THE VIOLATIONS BY THE
ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT OF INTERNATIONAL
LAW AS WELL AS NON-COMPLIANCE TO THE COMMITMENTS MADE WHEN THE RELEASE
AND EXCHANGE OF COLONEL [OMAR NAPOLEON] AVALOS WAS NEGOTIATED IN
PANAMA [IN 1987].

   2.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND GREETS THE DISABLED COMRADES AND
CONGRATULATES THEM ON DEMANDING THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY
AND OBTAIN ADEQUATE MEDICAL ATTENTION.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND ALSO CALLS
ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO OFFER SOLIDARITY
AND SUPPORT FOR THE JUST DEMANDS OF THE WAR DISABLED.  WE RECOGNIZE AND
ENCOURAGE THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE THAT MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS IS
GIVING IN FINDING A JUST SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT
HINDERING HIS WORK AS A MEDIATOR IN SOLVING THE CONFLICT.

   3.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THE ARMED FORCES HAS ASSAULTED FMLN HOSPITALS,
CAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED MEDICAL STAFF AND PATIENTS.  ALSO, THEY
HAVE CAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED DISABLED PERSONS IN VARIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES.  THIS BEHAVIOR IS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE FMLN'S STRICT
RESPECT FOR THE HOSPITALS, MEDICAL STAFF, AS WELL AS THE ARMED FORCES'
DISABLED AND WOUNDED PERSONNEL, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VULNERABLE TARGETS OF OUR
ACTIONS.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND REITERATES THIS POLICY OF PRINCIPLES AND
DEMANDS THE SAME BEHAVIOR FROM THE ARMED FORCES.

   4.  FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE CATHEDRAL BY THE DISABLED, [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO] CRISTIANI IS TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE AN OBJECT OF
NEGOTIATION, DEMANDING CERTAIN ACTIONS OF THE FMLN.  THIS ATTITUDE BY THE
ARENA GOVERNMENT MIGHT MAKE THE PROBLEM MORE COMPLEX AND MAKE US REVERT TO
CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAD ALREADY SURPASSED.  THE DEPARTURE FROM THE COUNTRY OF
THE DISABLED IS A RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPECT, AND THIS CANNOT
BE CONSIDERED AN ISSUE THAT CAN BE USED FOR NEGOTIATIONS OR BLACKMAIL.

   WE ARE SURE THAT THIS JUST DEMAND WHICH HAS LED THE DISABLED COMRADES TO
STAY AT THE CATHEDRAL UNTIL THEY AND THEIR COMRADES CAN LEAVE THE COUNTRY
WILL BE SUPPORTED BY ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, WHILE INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WILL
LEAVE IT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT CRISTIANI, ARENA, AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE
ACTING IN AN UNJUST AND INCORRECT MANNER.  [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, 26

   BOGOTA, 28 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COMBINED ARMY AND POLICE FORCES HAVE
RAIDED AN OFFICE IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA THAT APPARENTLY SERVED AS THE "FINANCIAL
HEADQUARTERS" OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING GROUP HEADED BY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ
GACHA, THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSS. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS
MADE TODAY BY THE COLOMBIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY.

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED THE NUMBERS OF THE
BANK ACCOUNTS THE DRUG TRAFFICKER HAS IN COLOMBIA AND ABROAD.  THE
AUTHORITIES CONFISCATED 30 SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERS, TELEFAX, AND OTHER
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. THIS HAS BEEN ANOTHER SEVERE SETBACK FOR RODRIGUEZ
GACHA, ONE OF THE MAFIA BOSSES MOST WANTED BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS THE MEXICAN, IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE RIGHT-HAND
MAN OF PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S TOP BOSS.  GACHA'S GROUP
HAS SUFFERED MANY LOSSES DUE TO THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT
AGAINST COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA. OVER THE
PAST FEW DAYS, ELITE ARMY TROOPS HAVE SEIZED SEVERAL LARGE FARMS OWNED BY
RODRIGUEZ GACHA IN THE TOWN OF PACHO, AS WELL AS LUXURIOUS RESIDENCES IN
BOGOTA. A SON OF RODRIGUEZ GACHA, FREDDY RODRIGUEZ CELADES, AND THE GROUP'S
"CHIEF OF FINANCES," FERNANDO GALEANO BERRIO--WHO IS WANTED BY THE U.S.
AUTHORITIES--ARE BEING HELD BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES.  

   HOWEVER, DESPITE THE "WAR" THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED ON THE DRUG
TRAFFICKING GANGS, A SUPERIOR COURT HAS REVOKED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF
ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, RODRIGUEZ GACHA, AND OTHER PERSONS LINKED TO MASSACRES
CARRIED OUT BY RIGHTIST MILITARY GROUPS BEING TRAINED BY ISRAELI, BRITISH,
U.S., AND WEST GERMAN MERCENARIES, ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   THE RULING WAS MADE KNOWN YESTERDAY. TODAY THE COUNTRY IS STILL AMAZED,
CONSIDERING THAT THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE MAFIA LEADERS
MASTERMINDED THE MASSACRES, AS REPORTED BY JUSTICE MARIA ELENA DIAZ, WHO WAS
SHOT TO DEATH LAST MONTH, EVIDENTLY AS A REPRISAL FOR HAVING STATED THIS
OPINION.

   THE ARREST WARRANT ALSO INCLUDED LUIS RUBIO ROJAS, A FORMER MAYOR OF THE
TOWN OF PUERTO BOYACA, AN OPERATIONS CENTER OF RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY
ELEMENTS, AND SEVERAL ARMY DETACHMENT ELEMENTS WHO REPORTEDLY PROMOTE
TERRORIST SQUADRONS.  

   IT HAS BEEN FULLY ESTABLISHED THAT ARMED ULTRA-RIGHTIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN
TRAINED BY FOREIGN MERCENARIES, INCLUDING JAIR KLEIN, A FORMER ISRAELI ARMY
COLONEL WHO COMMANDED HIS COUNTRY'S ANTITERRORIST CORPS SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

   BOGOTA, 28 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO SAID
IN A MESSAGE "TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY," WHICH WAS ISSUED THIS EVENING
BY THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, THAT "THE SURVIVAL OF COLOMBIA, ONE OF
THE MOST STABLE AND OLDEST DEMOCRACIES IN LATIN AMERICA, IS IN DANGER."

   THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT CATEGORICALLY STATED:  "WE CANNOT REST UNTIL WE
HAVE DESTROYED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS.  WE HAVE CAPTURED
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND CONFISCATED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTIES AND
AIRCRAFT, AND WE WILL STEADFASTLY PURSUE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS DESPITE THEIR
RESOURCES AND MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS."

   THE PRESIDENCY SAID THAT BARCO'S MESSAGE WAS ALSO BROADCAST BY THE MOST
IMPORTANT TELEVISION NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES.

   DRUG TRAFFICKERS "MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES
RUNNING FROM A CIVILIZED SOCIETY," BARCO SAID IN HIS MESSAGE.

   THE PRESIDENT ADDED THAT "THERE MUST BE NO RESPITE OR HOME FOR THEM" AND
THAT "THERE MUST BE NO MARKET FOR THEIR DRUGS."

   BARCO'S DRAMATIC MESSAGE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS BROADCAST
SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS LEARNED THAT FABIO OCHOA RESTREPO, FATHER OF JORGE
LUIS, FABIO, AND DAVID OCHOA VASQUEZ -- WHOSE EXTRADITION HAS BEEN REQUESTED
BY THE U.S. AUTHORITIES -- SENT A PUBLIC LETTER TO BARCO PROPOSING THAT THEY
START "WITH A CLEAN SLATE."

   BARCO ADDED THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS HAVE TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT
JUST STRUGGLING AGAINST COLOMBIA, BECAUSE "THE WHOLE WORLD IS UNITED IN ITS
INDIGNATION AND IN ITS SOLIDARITY WITH THE ACTIONS WE ARE CURRENTLY CARRYING
OUT."

   VIRGILIO BARCO SAID DRUG TRAFFICKING IS "A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE THAT IS
BEING NURTURED BY THE HABITS OF MILLIONS OF COCAINE CONSUMERS, SOME OF WHOM
ARE PROBABLY LISTENING."

   "THOSE WHO DEPEND ON COCAINE HAVE PERMITTED THE APPEARANCE OF THE MOST
VIOLENT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT THE WORLD HAS KNOWN," THE PRESIDENT
STATED.

   "WHAT INITIALLY SEEMED A MATTER OF PERSONAL HABITS HAS HAD EXPLOSIVE
CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIETY," HE ADDED.

   BARCO WARNED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY:  "NATURALLY, IT IS MORE
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO REDUCE THE DEMAND THAN FOR US TO REDUCE THE OFFER.  WE
CANNOT FULLY DESTROY DRUG TRAFFICKING WHILE IT IS CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING
EXTRAORDINARY PROFITS AND WHILE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO CONSUME
ILLEGAL DRUGS SOMEWHERE, IN SOME COUNTRY."

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BEGAN AN ALL-OUT WAR AGAINST THE DRUG CARTELS 10
DAYS AGO, FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR AND LIBERAL PARTY

   MOSCOW (USSR), 28 AUG 89 -- [TEXT] IN VIEW OF THE RECENT INCIDENTS
AT TOBALABA AIRPORT, THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE [PCCH] HAS ISSUED
THE FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE:

   THE DICTATORSHIP INTENDS TO USE STILL UNCLEAR INCIDENTS THAT TOOK PLACE A
FEW DAYS AGO AT TOBALABA AIRPORT TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF PROVOCATION AND
ALARM WITH THE PURPOSE OF DISRUPTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLITICAL
PROCESS THAT SHOULD LEAD TO A DEMOCRATIC VICTORY ON 14 DECEMBER.

   PINOCHET'S OPEN INTERVENTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS
REMAINED CLEAR IN HIS 23 AUGUST SPEECH AND WAS RECENTLY DENOUNCED BY
OPPOSITION LEADER PATRICIO AYLWIN AND BY ALL OPPOSITION POLITICAL FORCES.

   THE DECLARATION ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, CNI -- AN
ORGANIZATION THAT FOR MANY YEARS HAS SHAMEFULLY VIOLATED THE MOST BASIC
RIGHTS OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE BY USING THE MOST CRUEL AND INHUMAN FORMS OF
TERROR AND VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILEAN DEMOCRATS AND WHOSE DISSOLUTION HAS BEEN
PROPOSED EVEN BY THE GOVERNMENT'S CANDIDATE HERNAN BUCHI -- INTENDS TO
MISGUIDE THE PEOPLE BY ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO IMPLICATE THE PCCH IN AN
INCIDENT IN WHICH IT HAD NO PARTICIPATION WHATSOEVER.

   THE CNI DECLARATION, EXPRESSLY ORDERED BY AUTHORITIES OF THE REGIME, GOES
TO THE EXTREME OF INFAMOUSLY MANIPULATING FAMILY TIES TO ATTACK OUR GENERAL
SECRETARY, COMRADE VOLODIA TEITELBOIM.

   THE REGIME SEEKS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF TERROR AND INTIMIDATION IN ORDER
TO IMPOSE THE ANTIDEMOCRATIC DEMANDS RECENTLY MADE BY PINOCHET.

   TO THIS END, AND AS PINOCHET HIMSELF HAS STATED, THE REGIME IS WILLING
EVEN TO RESORT TO FORCE ONCE AGAIN.  PART OF THIS PLAN IS THE MURDER OF LUIS
VARGAS, WHO WAS ARRESTED AND TORTURED BY THE CNI AND LATER THROWN OUT OF A
FIFTH- FLOOR WINDOW OF THE MILITARY COURT BUILDING AFTER BEING FALSELY
CHARGED WITH HAVING AN ARSENAL IN HIS HOME; THE SCANDALOUS COURT DECISION
THAT LEAVES UNPUNISHED THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INHUMAN DEATH OF RODRIGO
ROJAS DENEGRI AND THE SERIOUS INJURY OF CARMEN GLORIA QUINTANA; THE SHAMEFUL
SUPREME COURT DECISION CLEARING THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRIBLE CRIMES
AGAINST 10 CHILEANS IN LATE 1976; THE REGIME'S INTENTION TO IMPOSE A NEW
AMNESTY LAW TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF CASES OF VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE
PAST 16 YEARS UNPUNISHED; THE ARREST AND INCOMMUNICADO DETENTION OF 13
PEOPLE, AMONG THEM A PREGNANT WOMAN ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENTS AT
THE TOBALABA AIRPORT AND FOR WHOSE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INTEGRITY WE
FEAR.

   THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF PINOCHET, THE CNI, AND THE CIRCLES CLOSE TO
THE DICTATORSHIP'S DESPAIR IN VIEW OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE DEMOCRATIC
STRUGGLE AND THE GROWING UNITY OF ALL OPOSITION FORCES AROUND A SINGLE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND A COMMON PLATFORM DESIGNED TO DEMOCRATIZE THE
COUNTRY.

   AS ALWAYS WHEN IT FEELS THREATENED, THE DICTATORSHIP HAS DECIDED TO
DIVIDE AND CONFUSE THE OPPOSITION FORCES.

   WE APPEAL TO ALL DEMOCRATS TO COME TOGETHER EVEN MORE FIRMLY SO THE LEVEL
OF UNITY ACHIEVED BY THE OPPOSITION SECTOR WILL NOT ALLOW SUCH MANEUVERS TO
JEOPARDIZE THE RESOLUTE PROGRESS TOWARD THE MUCH DESIRED DEMOCRACY AND
FREEDOM FOR OUR PEOPLE.

   WE ALSO URGE THAT THIS PROVOCATION BE DENOUNCED BY DOUBLING EFFORTS TO
OVERWHELMINGLY DEFEAT THE DICTATORSHIP ON 14 DECEMBER, THUS TAKING A
DECISIVE STEP IN THE STRUGGLE TO DEFINITIVELY OUST THIS REGIME OF HATRED,
DEATH, AND PAIN.

   SIGNED: AMERICO ZORRILLA, JAIME INSUNZA, AND CARLOS MOLINAS FOR THE
COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE.

   BOGOTA, 29 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] SEVEN POWERFUL BOMBS WERE SET OFF IN
BOGOTA AND MEDELLIN EARLY THIS MORNING IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CONTINUATION
OF THE "WAR" DECLARED BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN REPRISAL FOR THE MAJOR
BLOWS THEY HAVE BEEN DEALT BY THE AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS AREAS OF COLOMBIA.  

   ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL POLICE REPORTS, SIX BOMBS EXPLODED IN MEDELLIN,
THE COUNTRY'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY, WHERE THE RESPONSE FROM THE DRUG DEALERS
HAS BEEN MORE STRONGLY FELT IN RECENT DAYS.

   THE BOMBS WERE PLACED IN LIQUOR STORES WHERE, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL
ESTIMATES, THE DAMAGE IS EXTENSIVE.

   MEDELLIN WAS THE FIRST CITY HIT BY THE DRUG CARTEL'S "COUNTERATTACK"
AFTER THE SO-CALLED "EXTRADITABLES" ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THEY VOWED
TO WAGE A "WAR" ON THE GOVERNMENT, JUDGES, BUSINESSMEN, AND JOURNALISTS
NATIONWIDE.  THE EXTRADITABLES ARE DRUG TRAFFICKERS SOUGHT BY U.S. COURTS.

   ON SUNDAY, NINE BOMBS EXPLODED AND COMPLETELY DESTROYED SEVERAL
STATE-OWNED BANKS.

   MEANWHILE, ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED IN BOGOTA IN FRONT OF A TRAVEL AGENCY,
BUT THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE HAS YET TO BE REPORTED.

   THE INTENSE OFFENSIVE BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION BEGAN
2 WEEKS AGO IN THE WAKE OF A NUMBER OF CRIMINAL ATTACKS THAT CLAIMED THE
LIVES OF PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN, A HIGH-RANKING POLICE
OFFICER, AND A JUDGE.

   THE POLICE REPORTED TODAY THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME, COMBINED ARMY AND
POLICE FORCES RAIDED SEVERAL PROPERTIES OWNED BY HERNANDO SUAREZ BURGOS,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, IN SOUTHWESTERN NARINO
DEPARTMENT.

   UNITS OF THE ELITE FORCES, THE MAIN ONES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATIONS, ALSO
RAIDED THE PRIVATE RESIDENCE OF BUSINESSMAN EDGARDO BARROS, PRESIDENT OF THE
SPORTING SOCCER CLUB OF CALI.

   POLICE SPOKESMEN ALSO REPORTED TODAY THAT MORE THAN 7,000 PEOPLE WHO HAD
BEEN ARRESTED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE OFFENSIVE WERE RELEASED WHEN IT WAS
FULLY PROVEN THEY HAD NO LINKS WITH THE DRUG MAFIAS.

   MEANWHILE, APPROXIMATELY 4,000 PEOPLE REMAIN IN CUSTODY AWAITING JUDICIAL
RULINGS.

   BOGOTA, 29 AUG 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] FOREIGN CRIMINALS, INCLUDING A PERSON
OF ARAB ORIGIN, PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR LUIS CARLOS
GALAN, THE LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO WAS GUNNED DOWN IN
BOGOTA ON 18 AUGUST, ACCORDING TO GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ, CHIEF OF THE
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS).

   "THERE IS A PERSON OF ARAB ORIGIN, WHO APPARENTLY HAS BEEN LINKED CLOSELY
TO THE CRIME," MAZA MARQUEZ TOLD THE MEDIA TODAY AFTER MEETING WITH
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS, WITH WHOM HE DISCUSSED THE
DRAFTING OF NEW SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.

   THE SUSPECT, JUBIS HAZVUMB [SPELLING AS RECEIVED], WHO WAS ARRESTED ALONG
WITH FOUR OTHER COLOMBIANS IN BOGOTA 2 DAYS AFTER GALAN'S ASSASSINATION, "IS
VERY MUCH INVOLVED," SAID MAZA, WHO IN LATE MAY WAS THE TARGET OF A DYNAMITE
ATTACK CARRIED OUT IN BOGOTA, IN WHICH HE WAS NOT WOUNDED.

   "WE HAVE RECEIVED ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONFIRM THAT FOREIGNERS PARTICIPATED
IN SENATOR GALAN'S ASSASSINATION," THE DAS CHIEF SAID.  HE ADDED THAT THE
INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO LOCATE THE PERPETRATORS HAVE SO
FAR BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

   "WE HAVE REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT MANY PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN GALAN'S
MURDER AND THAT IT WAS WELL-PLANNED," MAZA SAID.  

   HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL RECEIVE, STARTING
TODAY, ADDITIONAL PERSONAL SECURITY PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

   JERUSALEM (ISRAEL), 29 AUG 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
ENERGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE MINISTER MOSHE SHAHAL BY HAYIM HECHT]
[EXCERPT] BEFORE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF COLOMBIA, MINISTER SHAHAL
POINTED OUT: I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT ANY CARTELS IN COLOMBIA, NOR DID I
MEET ANY CATTLE BREEDERS [REFERENCE TO THE PROFESSION CLAIMED [BEGIN
RECORDING] [SHAHAL] WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP WITH COLOMBIA IN
SEVERAL VERY CONCRETE SPHERES.  THESE INCLUDE THE PURCHASE OF COAL,
FOR WHICH WE SIGNED A 4-YEAR CONTRACT DURING MY VISIT THERE ABOUT A
YEAR AGO.  THAT CONTRACT HAS BEEN FULFILLED TO THE SATISFACTION OF
BOTH SIDES.  THE COLOMBIAN COAL IS EXCELLENT, AS IS THE PRICE WE PAY
FOR IT.  WE ARE A VERY GOOD CUSTOMER, AND THE RELATIONS BETWEEN US ARE
VERY CLOSE.  [END RECORDING]

   BY THE WAY, THE TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WAS FORMULATED
BY THE LADY IN THE NEWS, MONICA DE GREIFF, WHO WAS THE ENERGY MINISTRY
DIRECTOR GENERAL DURING MINISTER SHAHAL'S VISIT TO COLUMBIA.  AT PRESENT SHE
IS BOGOTA'S JUSTICE MINISTER, AND IS HIDING IN THE UNITED STATES FROM THE
DRUG CARTEL'S ASSASSINATION THREATS.

   MINISTER SHAHAL STRESSED THAT IN HIS MEETINGS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION
HEADS IN COLOMBIA, THE LATTER HAD LAVISHED PRAISE ON THE ASSISTANCE EXTENDED
BY OUR DEFENSE SECTOR TO COLOMBIA.  

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SHAHAL] IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.  ISRAEL TRAINED
COLOMBIAN DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT ELEMENTS; THIS WAS DONE IN THE
CUSTOMARY WAY AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE DEFENSE MINISTER.  COLOMBIA
BOUGHT SECURITY PRODUCTS FROM ISRAEL, SUCH AS THE KFIR PLANES, WHICH
WERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COAL PURCHASE.  ON THE DAY I MET WITH THE
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT HE SIGNED AN ORDER APPROVING THE PURCHASE OF THE
KFIR PLANES BY THE COLOMBIAN AIR FORCE.  A DAY LATER WE SIGNED THE
COAL AGREEMENT.  THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE DEAL WAS ABOUT $200 TO $250
MILLION FOR EACH SIDE.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END RECORDING]

   BOGOTA, 29 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] FIVE HUNDRED COLOMBIAN JUDGES HAVE
ANNOUNCED THEIR "JOINT RESIGNATION" IN PROTEST OF THE ABOLITION OF THE JURY,
WHICH MAKES THE JUDGES FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR A SENTENCE.  THE JUDGES HAVE
ALSO COMPLAINED THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH OFFICIAL PROTECTION.

   THE JUDICIAL BRANCH NATIONAL ASSOCIATION [ASOCIACION NACIONAL DEL PODER
JUDICIAL] (ASONAL) REPORTED TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECISION --
WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON 28 AUGUST -- "REPRESENTS A GRAVE DANGER FOR THE
JUDGES, BECAUSE THEY ARE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECLARING A PERSON GUILTY AND
CONDEMNING THE CULPRITS."

   A GROUP OF LITIGANT LAWYERS ALSO ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY WILL NOT
PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC HEARINGS UNTIL THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE JURY, WHOSE
ABOLITION THEY CONSIDER UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

   ASONAL SECRETARY GENERAL ORLANDO MORALES TOLD EFE THAT THE JOINT
RESIGNATION INVOLVES 550 JUDGES IN BOGOTA AND CUNDINAMARCA, THE DEPARTMENT
IN WHICH THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IS LOCATED.

   THE RESIGNATION COULD BE ANNOUNCED DURING THE WEEKEND AS A "CONTINUATION"
OF THE 16 AUGUST STRIKE, WHEN 4,600 JUDGES DEMANDED MORE PROTECTION TO DO
THEIR WORK, MORALES ADDED.

   MORE THAN 200 OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN MURDERED SINCE THE COLOMBIAN JUSTICE
SYSTEM BEGAN ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DRUG LORDS IN 1981.

   THREE JUDGES HAVE BEEN MURDERED SO FAR THIS YEAR.  THEY WERE IN CHARGE OF
LAWSUITS AGAINST THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER DRUG TRAFFICKING LEADERS IN THE
COUNTRY.  THE LAWSUITS WERE LATER SUSPENDED.

   COLOMBIAN JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF TRAVELED TO THE UNITED STATES
ON 25 AUGUST TO REQUEST $2.5 MILLION IN AID TO GUARANTEE THE PROTECTION OF
COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND THEIR RELATIVES.  

   THE MINISTER AND HER 3-YEAR-OLD SON HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY THE DRUG
TRAFFICKING MAFIAS.


DEV-MUC3-0398 (BBN)

   BOGOTA, 29 AUG 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY IN
BOGOTA CONFIRMED TODAY THAT AT LEAST THREE-FOURTHS OF THE 10,797 PEOPLE
ARRESTED AFTER SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER ON 18 AUGUST HAVE BEEN
RELEASED.

   THE RELEASES TOOK PLACE AS THE PREVENTIVE ARREST DEADLINES ESTABLISHED IN
THE STATE OF SIEGE DECREES ISSUED ON 25 AUGUST BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S
LIBERAL GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO EXPIRE.

   COLONEL EDUARDO AREVALO, PRESS DIRECTOR FOR THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, TOLD
AFP THAT THE AUTHORITIES COULD ONLY DETAIN SUSPECTS FOR 7 WORKING DAYS.

   IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT WHEN ARRESTS ARE MADE ON SPECIFIC DRUG TRAFFICKING
CHARGES, HE EXPLAINED.

   "THERE ARE NO EXACT FIGURES REGARDING THE PERSONS RELEASED, BUT I CAN
ASSURE YOU THAT AT LEAST THREE-FOURTHS OF THE DETAINEES ARE INVOLVED," COL
AREVALO SAID.

   THAT PROPORTION OF THE ALMOST 10,797 DETENTIONS MADE DURING THE
OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AGAINST COMMON CRIMINALS AND
PRESUMED ACCOMPLICES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS, LEADS TO THE ASSUMPTION
THAT APPROXIMATELY 3,500 PEOPLE REMAIN IN CUSTODY AT THE JAILS, POLICE
INSPECTION OFFICES, AND OTHER BRANCHES.

   THE LEGAL SITUATION OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ESTABLISHED AS THEIR
TERMS EXPIRE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, AREVALO SAID.

   AREVALO EXPLAINED TO AFP THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW DIFFICULTIES
REGARDING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND ARRESTED, ADDING THAT THE
DIFFICULTIES STEM FROM THE WORK STOPPAGE IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IN PROTEST
OVER THE ASSASSINATION OF JUSTICE CARLOS VALENCIA IN BOGOTA.  

   HE SAID THAT AMONG THE DETAINEES ARE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD BE
EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES.

   ONE OF THE EXTRADITABLES IS EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, CAPTURED WHILE HE
WAS VACATIONING ON HIS FARM IN TOLU, A VILLAGE IN THE NORTHWESTERN PROVINCE
OF SUCRE ON THE CARIBBEAN COAST, APPROXIMATELY 750 KM FROM BOGOTA, AND HIS
TRANSFER TO THE UNITED STATES COULD COME AT ANY MOMENT.

   THE PROCEDURES FOR MARTINEZ ROMERO'S EXTRADITION WERE CARRIED OUT
UNEVENTFULLY AFTER THE U.S. EMBASSY MADE THE REQUEST.  HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN
REPORTED THAT HIS EXTRADITION MAY BE POSTPONED FOR A FEW DAYS BECAUSE THE
SUPREME COURT SUSPENDED THE DEADLINES FOR THE ELECTION OF JUSTICES AT 27
HIGHER COURTS.

   THE SUPREME COURT'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE
10 WORKING DAYS TO STATE THEIR POSITIONS REGARDING THE LEGALITY OF THE
EXECUTIVE DECREES, WITHOUT WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO ABSTAIN FROM
AUTHORIZING FUTURE EXTRADITIONS.

   "WE MUST NOT ACT HASTILY BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE ERRORS.  SOME OF
THE EXTRADITABLES MAY BE INNOCENT," COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER CARLOS LEMUS
TOLD AFP.
