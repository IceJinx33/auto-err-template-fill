   SAN SALVADOR, 29 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY
GAVE ASSURANCES TONIGHT THAT THE SITUATION "HAS BEEN CONTROLLED" IN
THE VICINITY OF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, WHERE TODAY ONCE AGAIN
THE REBELS AND THE MILITARY CLASHED.

   NEVERTHELESS, ARMED FORCES SPOKESMAN MAJOR MAURICIO CHAVEZ SAID ON
A RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK THAT IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD "THE
SITUATION REMAINS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE TERRORISTS HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL
CIVILIANS AS HOSTAGES."

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF CIVILIANS ARE BEING
HELD HOSTAGE BY GUERRILLAS IN ESCALON, AN EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOOD IN
THE NORTHEN PART OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE CLASHES RESUMED AT DAWN ON 29
NOVEMBER.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) TODAY ALSO
ATTACKED THE GENERAL STAFF, A RESIDENCE FOR U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS,
AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE.

   THE REBELS HAVE OCCUPIED SEVERAL MANSIONS FROM WHICH THEY ARE
ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS IN AN AREA POPULATED BY GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS, DIPLOMATS, AND WHERE THE UN OFFICE IN EL SALVADOR IS
LOCATED.

   ACCORDING TO THE OFFICER, THE ARMY HAS BESIEGED THE AREA AND
"EXPECTS TO CONTROL THE SITUATION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS."

   MAJOR CHAVEZ CACERES REASSERTED THE "ARMY'S IRREVOCABLE WILL TO
DEFEND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION" IN THAT AREA, WHILE THE SALVADORAN
GREEN CROSS REPORTED THAT IT HAS EVACUATED SEVERAL FAMILIES FROM THE
SECTOR.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 29 NOV 89 (RADIO PEACE AND PROGRESS) -- [COMMENTARY]
[ALEKSEY PAVLOV] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI
ANNOUNCED LAST SUNDAY THAT THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR HAS BROKEN
DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA.  ANALYST ALEKSEY PAVLOV DISCUSSES THIS
SUBJECT:

   FOR THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN ISSUES, THIS NEWS
IS NO SURPRISE. GIVEN THE FAILURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS AS WELL AS THE RESUMPTION OF
THE WAR, THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION WAS PRESSURED BY CERTAIN U.S.
CIRCLES TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.

   THE [WORD INDISTINCT] MEDIA ARE CONDUCTING A CRUSADE TO CONVINCE
THE PUBLIC THAT CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND CERTAINLY THE USSR, ARE PROVIDING
WEAPONS TO THE [WORD INDISTINCT] REVOLUTIONARIES.  THE UNITED STATES
CERTAINLY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND SO HAS
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BY DECLARING THAT HE WILL NOT ATTEND THE REGIONAL
PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER IN MANAGUA.

   APPARENTLY, CRISTIANI NEEDED TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA IN
ORDER NOT TO ATTEND TO THE SUMMIT.  THIS IS COMPREHENSIBLE BECAUSE THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE COMPLIANCE
WITH THE TELA AGREEMENTS, THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS, AND THE
CONTINUATION OF PEACE TALKS IN EL SALVADOR. IN FACT, CRISTIANI WAS
UNABLE TO JUSTIFY HIS REFUSAL TO ATTEND THIS SUMMIT.

   THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY CRISTIANI WISHES TO USE THE BREAK WITH
NICARAGUA AS A MASK.  HE IS TRYING TO DISTRACT PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM
THE SALVADORAN ARMY'S HEAVY BOMBINGS OF HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS,
INCLUDING THE CAPITAL, AND THE REPRESSION AGAINST SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS
AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.

   IN OTHER TERMS, CRISTIANI WANTS TO CONCEAL THE FACT THAT HE CANNOT
CONTROL THE EXCESSES COMMITTED BY HIS GENERALS; THAT IS, THE GENOCIDE
THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS PERPETRATING AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE.  THE
CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO UNABLE TO CONTROL THE DEATH SQUADS
WHICH ARE MURDERING PEOPLE WITH IMPUNITY.

   IT IS REVEALING THAT SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE CRISTIANI DECLARED THE
BREAK OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA, NICARAGUAN EMBASSY STAFF IN
SAN SALVADOR WERE EVACUATED HOME IN FACE OF THE DEATH THREATS BY THE
DEATH SQUADS.  IS THIS MERE COINCIDENCE?  OF COURSE NOT.  MOST
PROBABLY THESE DEATH SQUADS RECEIVED ORDERS TO MAKE SUCH THREATS WITH
A VIEW TOWARD THE DIPLOMATIC BREAK.

   BY WHAT CAN BE SEEN, THE ACTION OF DEATH SQUADS IS COMMON PRACTICE
FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THIS DIPLOMATIC BREAK IS A
SERIOUS ACT FOR WHICH CRISTIANI IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE.  HONDURAN
PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYO CONSIDERS THIS ACTION A GREAT DANGER TO
PEACE IN THE ISTHMUS.  THIS IS AN UNQUESTIONABLE FACT.  


DEV-MUC3-0904 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, 30 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT]
REGARDING THE INTERNATIONAL SCANDAL THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS
MADE OVER AN ALLEGED SHIPMENT OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES FOUND INSIDE
A WRECKED LIGHT AIRCRAFT, THE FMLN EXPRESSES THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  IN VIEW OF A POSSIBLE INTENSIFICATION OF THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT, IT IS NECESSARY TO NOTE THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES
WERE THE FIRST ONES TO ESCALATE THE WAR BY LAUNCHING INDISCRIMINATE
ATTACKS AND AIR BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN DENSELY
POPULATED URBAN AREAS.  THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAD BEEN DOING
THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN OUR COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS.  IN VIEW OF THE
DAMAGE THAT THIS CAUSES THE POPULATION, SINCE 1987 THE FMLN HAS MADE
PROPOSALS TO SCALE DOWN THE WAR AND SUSPEND THE USE OF AIRCRAFT AND
AVIATION EQUIPMENT.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S CHARGES ARE HYPOCRITICAL, AS THE
GOVERNMENT ITSELF HAS TURNED AIRCRAFT INTO REAL INSTRUMENTS OF
GENOCIDE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   2.  THE POLICY OF THE PREVIOUS U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS TURNED
CENTRAL AMERICA INTO A HUGE ARMS MARKET WHEREBY THOUSANDS OF TONS OF
SOVIET AND U.S. WEAPONS, INCLUDING SURFACE-TO AIR MISSILES, HAVE BEEN
INTRODUCED INTO THE AREA.  THIS HAS CREATED A FLOURISHING BLACK MARKET
FOR WEAPONS, WHERE SALVADORAN AND HONDURAN MILITARY MEN AND NICARAGUAN
CONTRAS PARTICIPATE AS BIG-TIME SMUGGLERS.

   3.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN A CAMPAIGN OF ACCUSATIONS
AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF PUTTING UP A
SMOKE SCREEN TO COVER THE GENOCIDE IT HAS UNLEASHED AND TO DIVERT THE
ATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS BEEN DEMANDING:

       A) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT STOP THE MASSIVE AND
INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS IN DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS AND THE
PERSECUTION AGAINST THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND GRASS ROOTS
MOVEMENTS;

       B) AN INVESTIGATION TO CLEAR UP THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTIC WORKERS, ALONG WITH THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE AND SIMILAR CRIMES; AND,

       C) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPT THE CEASE-FIRE IT HAS
HERETOFORE REJECTED AND JUSTIFY ITS INTRANSIGENT AND IRRATIONAL
POSITION.

   4.  CRISTIANI'S DECISION TO SUSPEND RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA BASED
ON AN ALLEGED SHIPMENT OF MISSILES FOR THE FMLN IS NOT REASONABLE, NOT
EVEN BY SAYING THAT THIS REPRESENTS AN ESCALATION OF THE SALVADORAN
WAR.  IN FACT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ESCALATED THE WAR BY SENDING $4
BILLION IN AID TO STRENGTHEN THE ARMY AND PROVIDE IT WITH A POWERFUL
AIR FORCE.

   THE JUSTIFICATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN NICARAGUA'S SUPPORT TO THE FMLN,
THUS REFUSING TO ADMIT THE INTERNAL CAUSES OF THE CONFLICT AND ALSO
KEEPING THE DOORS CLOSED TO ANY NEGOTIATIONS.  THIS HAS
UNNECESSARILY PROLONGED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S SUFFERING AND HAS       
MADE MORE DRAMATIC THEIR LEGITIMATE STRUGGLE FOR A TRUE DEMOCRATIC,
PLURALIST, AND NON-ALIGNED GOVERNMENT.

   BASED ON THE ABOVE, WE REITERATE:

   1.  THAT WE CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY LEGITIMATE OUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN ALL
TYPES OF WEAPONS TO GUARANTEE OUR DEFENSE AND TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE
FROM THE [WORD INDISTINCT] MILITARY ESCALATION PROMOTED BY THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE FIRM SUPPORT OF THE PREVIOUS AND
PRESENT U.S. GOVERNMENTS.  THIS INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN WEAPONS
FROM VARIOUS SOURCES AND TO GUARANTEE THEIR ARRIVAL AT OUR WAR FRONTS
THROUGH ANY MEANS AVAILABLE.

   2.  WE MAINTAIN OUR TOTAL WILLINGNESS TO DE-ESCALATE THE WAR.  WE
BEGIN BY EXPRESSING THAT WE ARE TOTALLY WILLING TO AGREE ON A
CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION AND TO BEGIN REAL
NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THE NATION'S
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES.

   3.  WE ARE WILLING TO REFRAIN FROM USING THE SURFACE-TO-AIR
MISSILES IF THE AIR FORCE CALLS A COMPLETE HALT TO ITS BOMBINGS,
STRAFING, AND MACHINEGUNNING THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

   EL SALVADOR, 29 NOVEMBER 1989


DEV-MUC3-0905 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THERE IS A TENSE
CALM, INTERRUPTED BY SPORADIC SHOOTING, IN THE EXCLUSIVE ESCALON
NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL TODAY.  AT THE SAME TIME, MANY
FOREIGNERS ARE LEAVING THE NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH WAS THE SITE OF HEAVY
FIGHTING BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GUERRILLAS YESTERDAY.

   AN OFFICIAL OF THE UN OFFICE, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE AREA OF
FIGHTING, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "ALL THE PERSONNEL ARE FINE AND WE ARE
NOW EVACUATING SOME EMPLOYEES AND FOREIGNERS LIVING IN THE AREA,
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CEASE-FIRE" THAT WAS ORDERED BY THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS FOR SEVERAL HOURS.

   "WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY GUERRILLAS.  THE SOLDIERS ARE IN THE AREA AND
ENTRANCE IS RESTRICTED.  THEY ARE ONLY PERMITTING THE EVACUATION," THE
OFFICIAL SAID OVER THE TELEPHONE.

   A SPOKESMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) SAID THIS
MORNING THAT THE ELITE COUNTERINSURGENCY BELLOSO AND ATLACATL
BATTALIONS AND TROOPS WITH ARTILLERY ARE CARRYING OUT A SPECIAL
OPERATION IN ESCALON TO DISLODGE THE REBELS.  THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE
OPERATION WILL INCLUDE ALL OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, HE SAID
HE COULD NOT PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION BECAUSE "WE ARE STILL
COMPILING INFORMATION."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ON 29 NOVEMBER
RESUMED ITS ATTACKS IN SAN SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE UPPER CLASS
NEIGHBORHOODS OF ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND MAQUILISHUAT AND THE MIDDLE
CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS OF JARDIN GUADALUPE, LA CIMA, AND LOMAS DE SAN
FRANCISCO.

   AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF FIGHTING IN THE STREETS OF THE
NEIGHBORHOODS, THE ARMY SAID IT HAD THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL.
HOWEVER, IT ADMITTED THAT THE REBELS HAD ENTRENCHED THEMSELVES IN
ESCALON AND HAD SEIZED "THE RESIDENTS AS HOSTAGES."

   THE GUERRILLAS ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT THAT FROM 0600 TO 1200 (1200 -
1800 GMT) TODAY, 30 NOVEMBER, THEY "WILL UNDERTAKE THE EVACUATION OF
FOREIGN PERSONNEL" IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS IN
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.  THE FMLN SAID THE MEASURE, WHICH IS BEING
HEEDED BY THE FOREIGNERS LIVING IN THOSE AREAS, IS TO GUARANTEE THE
LIVES OF THE RESIDENTS OF ESCALON.

   VARIOUS SOURCES SAID THE REBELS HAVE LEFT ESCALON, BUT THIS
INFORMATION HAS YET TO BE CONFIRMED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [TEXT] THE
CLANDESTINE AND LIAR RADIO STATIONS OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS CONTINUE TO CONDUCT A
DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WITH THE PURPOSE OF
DISTORTING THE TRUTH REGARDING THE AGGRESSION THESE BANDITS HAVE
LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   VERY FREQUENTLY THEY BROADCAST REPORTS OF UNIMAGINABLE MILITARY
VICTORIES OF THE FMLN.  THEIR LIAR RADIO STATIONS SAY THEY HAVE
OCCUPIED THE MUNICIPALITIES OF SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE,
CIUDAD DELGADO, AND OTHERS, WHICH, DESPITE THE TRAGEDY WE ARE
SUFFERING, MAKES PEOPLE BURST OUT LAUGHING BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS
THESE ARE BIG LIES.  THESE CLAIMS ARE ABSOLUTELY FALSE.  THE RESIDENTS
OF THOSE MUNICIPALITIES ARE GOING TO THEIR JOBS, BUSES ARE OPERATING,
AND EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES ARE BEING CONDUCTED IN A NORMAL MANNER.

   THE LIAR RADIO STATIONS OF THE FMLN THINK THEY CAN CONFUSE THE
PUBLIC OPINION WITH THEIR FALSE INFORMATION.  THESE STATIONS ARE USED
FOR PROPAGANDISTIC AND DISINFORMATION PURPOSES TO MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF
THE FMLN IS WINNING MILITARY VICTORIES, WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER ATTAINED
AND WHICH ARE ONLY IN THE MINDS OF ORTEGA'S PUPPETS, WHO BROADCAST
FROM MANAGUA.

   THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING THEMSELVES: WHERE ARE THE COWARDLY TERRORIST
AND MURDEROUS CHIEFS OF THE FMLN, SHAFIK HANDAL, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS,
AND OTHER COWARDS, WHO ARE IN MANAGUA ENJOYING A LUXURIOUS LIFE AND
GOOD FOOD?

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE VICTORIOUS ACTIONS OF
OUR ARMED FORCES, WHO SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS GENOCIDAL AND
TERRORIST FMLN OFFENSIVE HAVE FACED THE AGGRESSIVE MERCENARIES BY
REDUCING THEM TO SMALL TERRORIST GROUPS, WHICH ARE LOST AND ARE
IRRATIONALLY ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   THE FMLN HAS RIDICULOUSLY CLAIMED TO COMPLETELY CONTROL CERTAIN
MUNICIPALITIES.  ALL OF THESE LIES SHOW THAT THE MURDEROUS FMLN
LEADERS DO NOT HAVE ANY ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH TO CONCEAL THEIR
UNSUCCESSFUL REBEL OFFENSIVE.

   THEIR GREATEST FAILURE HAS BEEN THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S REJECTION
OF THE REBEL ACTIONS.  DESPITE SO MANY THREATS MADE BY THE FMLN
TERRORISTS, OUR PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SUPPORTED THEM, LET ALONE AGREED TO
ACCEPT THE WEAPONS THAT THE FMLN WERE OFFERING THEM IF THEY JOINED THE
REBELLION.  THE FMLN AND ITS TERRORIST OFFENSIVE, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED
WITH THE WEAPONS THAT DICTATOR ORTEGA HAS GIVEN TO THE FMLN PUPPETS,
HAS FAILED, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE EXPECT THE NATIONS OF THE FREE
WORLD TO CONDEMN THIS GENOCIDAL AGGRESSION OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 1 DEC 89 (PRAVDA) -- [COMMENTARY] [PAVEL BOGOMOLOV]
[TEXT] JUDGING BY NEWS AGENCY REPORTS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVENTS IN EL
SALVADOR HAS REACHED AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS POINT.  PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI'S REFUSAL TO RESPOND TO THE INSURGENTS' RECENT CEASE- FIRE
PROPOSAL HAS RESULTED IN A FRESH OUTBREAK OF BLOODSHED.

   HAVING REJECTED OUT OF HAND LAST WEEK THE VERY IDEA OF THE
RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI LIBERATION MOVEMENT, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO SECRET OF ITS INTENTION OF QUICKLY DRIVING THE
GUERRILLAS BACK INTO THE MOUNTAINS USING U.S. MILITARY SUPPLIES.
"ELITE" ARMY BATTALIONS HAD ALREADY PREPARED FOR PUNITIVE ASSAULTS.
BUT WHAT HAPPENED?  THE REGIME'S GAMBLE ON MILITARY FORCE PROVED
FUTILE.  THE INSURGENTS REGROUPED THEIR FORCES, BROUGHT UP RESERVES,
AND STRUCK A POWERFUL NEW BLOW.

   THE SALVADORAN DRAMA IS INCREASINGLY SHARPLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE
IMPROVEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE.  REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, THE EEC, THE VATICAN, FRANCE, AND A NUMBER OF
OTHER COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW STRESSING THE ACUTE NEED TO
URGE THE WARRING SIDES IN EL SALVADOR TO REACH A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT
BASED ON MUTUAL COMPROMISE.  AND IT IS A VERY GREAT PITY THAT SUCH AN
APPEAL HAS NOT COME FROM THAT CAPITAL WHICH THE SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES
HEED ABOVE ALL OTHERS -- WASHINGTON.

   ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO THE URGENT EVACUATION OF U.S. CITIZENS FROM
EL SALVADOR THAT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY.  I RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE
CONDITIONS OF AN ARMED CONFLICT THIS IS A NECESSARY STEP.  BUT IT IS
NO SECRET THAT IN THE RECENT PAST SUCH ACTIONS BY THE U.S.
ADMINISTRATION WERE AN OMINOUS SYMPTOM OF THE PREPARATION OF OVERTLY
INTERVENTIONIST PLANS.

   END THE BLOODSHED -- THAT IS THE PRIORITY TASK TODAY.  AND THE
RESTORATION OF THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSURGENTS
THAT WAS BROKEN OFF SHOULD BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARD THAT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER, CIN] [TEXT] FOLLOWING A SOVIET ORDER,
DANIEL ORTEGA HAS BEEN FORCED TO EXPELL FROM NICARAGUA THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORIST LEADERS WHO FOR
YEARS HAVE KEPT THEIR GENERAL COMMAND POST IN MANAGUA, WITH ORTEGA'S
SUPPORT AND PROTECTION.  WHEN THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT CONFIRMED THAT
ORTEGA HAD SUPPLIED ARMS TO THE FMLN, WHICH WERE SECRETLY INTENDED FOR
THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE SANDINIST ARMY -- AS WAS THE CASE OF THE
SAM-7 MISSILES -- THEY ORDERED HIM TO STOP SUPPORTING THE FMLN
TERRORISTS BECAUSE THIS IS ENDANGERING USSR AND U.S. RAPPROCHEMENT
POLICIES.  THE KREMLIN HAS REACTED WITH NOTICEABLE ANNOYANCE FOLLOWING
FIDEL CASTRO AND DANIEL ORTEGA'S DIRECT MEDDLING, WHICH IS CAUSING
SERIOUS DIVISIONS WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT
BECAUSE SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID NOT AGREE ON SUPPORTING THE FMLN
TERRORIST UPSURGE.

   THE EXPULSION ORDER FOR JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS,
AND OTHER FMLN LEADERS IS EXPECTED ANY MOMENT NOW.  THIS WILL
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE FMLN'S POLITICAL CLOUT.  AT THE SUMMIT
MEETING BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND U.S. PRESIDENTS, CASTRO AND ORTEGA'S
AGGRESSION, USING THE FMLN AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WILL BE
REVIEWED FOLLOWING PRESIDENT ARIAS OF COSTA RICA'S INITIATIVE.

DEPORTED FROM EL SALVADOR AND 14 WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITHIN
THE NEXT FEW HOURS AFTER BEING DECLARED "PERSONA NON GRATA" FOR
ALLEGEDLY COLLABORATING WITH THE GUERRILLAS.

   LEIVA TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS
HAVE BEEN REMANDED TO THE COURTS, CHARGED WITH ARMS POSSESSION OR FOR
TAKING PART IN ARMED ACTIONS IN COMPLICITY WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN). LEIVA SAID THAT THE SEVEN DEPORTEES
WILL BE "PERMANENTLY" BANNED SO THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN TO EL
SALVADOR.

   AMONG THE DEPORTED ARE U.S. CITIZENS, DUTCH, GERMANS, AND JAPANESE,
ADDED LEIVA. THE SALVADORAN OFFICIAL DID NOT RELEASE THE NAMES OF THE
DEPORTEES OR THE FOREIGNERS WHO WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN THE
NEXT FEW HOURS.

   JENNIFER CASOLO, A U.S. CITIZEN, WAS ARRESTED BY THE SECURITY CORPS
AND ACCUSED OF "ARMS POSSESSION."  GRABRIELA TORNAGO, AN ITALIAN, WAS
ARRESTED AND ACCUSED OF "FINANCING, RECRUITING, AND BEING INVOLVED
WITH TERRORIST GROUPS."

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, CASOLA WAS ARRESTED AT DAYBREAK ON
26 NOVEMBER AT A HOUSE LOCATED IN THE "MIRAVALLE" NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE
THE ARMY CLAIMS TO HAVE FOUND A GREAT AMOUNT OF WEAPONS.  TORNAGO WAS
ARRESTED MORE THAN A WEEK AGO IN THE "PRADOS DE VENECIA" NEIGHBORHOOD.
POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT THE ITALIAN WAS PREPARING A FAKE WEDDING AT
HER RESIDENCE TO GATHER PEOPLE LINKED WITH THE GUERRILLAS, WHO ON 11
NOVEMBER STARTED AN ALLEGED "INSURRECTION."

   LEIVA ASSURED THAT THE FOREIGNERS WHO ARE LINKED TO THE GUERRILLAS
WILL BE REMANDED TO THE COURTS BY THE SECURITY FORCE THAT MAKES THE
ARREST.

SAN SALVADOR AND SAID THAT "THERE IS A GENERALIZED SUSPICION THAT NO ONE CAN
HIDE, AND IT IS THAT THE EXTREME RIGHT AND NOT THE EXTREME LEFT COMMITTED
THESE MURDERS."

   PEREZ, WHO EXPRESSED HIS VIEWPOINTS ABOUT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION
DURING HIS NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE MIRAFLORES PALACE, SAID THAT IT IS
VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE CRIMES BE INVESTIGATED AND THAT THE
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES BE PUNISHED.  HE ADDED THAT HE HAS TELEPHONED
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH
AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS.

   THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THE
EVIDENCE POINTS IN ONE DIRECTION TO THE AUTHORS OF THE CRIMES
COMMITTED ON 16 NOVEMBER, "WE CANNOT TAKE ANY SIDES IN THIS ISSUE,
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION, AND THAT IS
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE."

   CONCERNING THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO SUSPEND COOPERATION
WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, PEREZ POINTED OUT
THAT THIS ACTION IS ONE WAY OF MAINTAINING AN ACTIVE NEUTRALITY.

   ACCORDING TO THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT, THE SPANISH STAND IS ONE OF
COOPERATION SO THAT THERE WILL BE PEACE AND UNDERSTANDING IN CENTRAL
AMERICA, BECAUSE IT IS WITHDRAWING THE AID AS LONG AS IT IS UNCLEAR
HOW SERIOUS THE CONFLICTING PARTIES ARE ABOUT REACHING AN AGREEMENT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES STATED THIS EVENING THAT THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE "HAS FAILED
AND HAS NOT REPRESENTED A MILITARY THREAT" TO THE ARMY FOLLOWING 19
DAYS OF STRONG REBEL ATTACKS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF 10 YEARS OF WAR.

   ARMY SPOKESMAN MAJOR MAURICIO CHAVEZ CACERES SAID THAT "FOLLOWING
THE FAILURE OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR
OVER A YEAR, WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM THEM (THE REBELS) IS ATTACKS ON
PROMINENT PEOPLE AND ON THE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ACTIONS TO
SCARE THE POPULATION."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] RENEWED ITS
ATTACKS EARLY ON 29 NOVEMBER WHEN IT ATTACKED THE COUNTRY'S MOST
IMPORTANT MILITARY INSTALLATION AND SET FIRE TO A RESIDENCE OF U.S.
MILITARY ADVISERS AND CONFRONTED THE ARMY IN EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS
IN NORTHWEST SAN SALVADOR.

   FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER AND PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
JUSTICE FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO DIED ON 28 NOVEMBER WHEN HE WAS
STRAFFED BY GUERRILLAS, ACCORDING TO MILITARY SOURCES.  THIS TOOK
PLACE HOURS BEFORE THE RENEWED FIGHTING WHICH PRODUCED 40 CASUALTIES
AMONG GUERRILLAS AND SOLDIERS.

   IN AN OFFICIAL RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCAST, CHAVEZ CACERES TODAY
ACCUSED THE FMLN OF DESTROYING SOME RESIDENCES IN THE EXCLUSIVE
ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD WITH DYNAMITE, IN NORTHWEST SAN SALVADOR, AND OF
FIRING ON PRIVATE VEHICLES IN HIGH- AND MIDDLE-CLASS SAN SALVADOR
NEIGHBORHOODS.

   THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID: "THEY (THE REBELS) HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE
TO DEAL A MILITARY BLOW; THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PUT UP A FIGHT
WITH A SINGLE ARMY BATTALION OR COMPANY."

   THE FMLN GUERRILLAS TODAY VACATED THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER
HOLDING, FOR OVER 24 HOURS, SEVERAL HOUSES THERE, FROM WHICH THEY
CONFRONTED THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS.

   THE FMLN ANNOUNCED A TRUCE FROM 0600 TO 1200 (1200 TO 1800 GMT)
TODAY TO EVACUATE FOREIGNERS, DIPLOMATS, AND CIVILIAN RESIDENTS FROM
ESCALON.

   OVER 200 U.S. CITIZENS LEFT TODAY FOR THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF
THE FIGHTING, PARTICULARLY IN ESCALON, A RESIDENTIAL AREA IN WHICH
DIPLOMATS, HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND POWERFUL BUSINESSMEN
LIVE.

   SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER,
APPROXIMATELY 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN
THE FIGHTING BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND REBELS, WHICH HAS ALSO RESULTED IN
SEVERE ECONOMIC LOSSES.

   THE AIR FORCES OFFICERS INVOLVED REPORTED THAT IN BOTH CASES THE

THE TWO SALVADORAN AIR FORCE A-37 PLANES THAT THE MISSILES WERE HEADED

THE FMLN MISSILES FROM HITTING THEM.

   THE FMLN CONTINUES TO RECEIVE SOVIET ARMS SUPPLIES THROUGH CUBA AND
NICARAGUA, AN ACTION WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN OFFICIALLY DENOUNCED TO
THE ENTIRE WORLD AND WHICH THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE FULLY REPUDIATE.  THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPLIED THE FMLN TERRORISTS WITH THIS TYPE
OF SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY OF SOVIET MANUFACTURE, WHICH CONFIRMS THAT
THE FMLN, APART FROM HAVING ITS GENERAL COMMAND INSIDE NICARAGUAN
TERRITORY, HAS THE MILITARY SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE OF THE SANDINIST
REGIME.  OFFICIAL SOURCES BELIEVE THAT THE SAM-7 MISSILES FIRED BY THE
FMLN AGAINST THE AIR FORCE PLANES COULD BE AMONG THE WEAPONS THAT WERE
ONBOARD THE OTHER SMALL PLANE THAT WAS SET ON FIRE BY THE TERRORISTS
AFTER THEY HAD UNLOADED IT.

   AS SOON AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT LEARNED OF THE SAM-7 SHIPMENTS
TO THE FMLN, THEY REPORTED IT TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  IN
RESPONSE TO THIS REPORT, THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT, SHOWING GREAT
ANNOYANCE, ORDERED A FREEZE ON ALL ARMS SHIPMENTS TO THE ORTEGA
GOVERNMENT, WHICH, FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM FIDEL CASTRO, SUPPLIES
MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED
THAT AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY ON THE PARTICIPATION OF MERCENARIES
FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONGSIDE THE FMLN, CAUSING
THE GENOCIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   MADRID (SPAIN), 1 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUA, WHICH WAS ACCUSED BY
EL SALVADOR AT THE [UNITED NATIONS] SECURITY COUNCIL ON 30 NOVEMBER OF
WORSENING THE TENSION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS ASKED THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO
ISSUE A CALL FOR AN "IMMEDIATE" CEASE-FIRE AND FOR THE RESUMPTION OF
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS.

   ALEJANDRO SERRANO CALDERA, NICARAGUAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
NATIONS, ALSO REQUESTED THAT THE COUNCIL ASK UN SECRETARY GENERAL
JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR "TO UNDERTAKE SPECIAL EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE AND
SUPERVISE" A CEASE-FIRE IN EL SALVADOR.

   WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE DRAFT RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY NICARAGUA AND
RELEASED TODAY, THE SECURITY COUNCIL LAST NIGHT SUSPENDED ITS MEETING,
WHICH HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY EL SALVADOR TO REPORT NICARAGUAN SHIPMENTS
OF WEAPONS, INCLUDING SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, TO THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS.

   IN THE DRAFT RESOLUTION, NICARAGUA ASKED THE COUNCIL TO
"VIGOROUSLY" CONDEMN THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS "BY A
GROUP WEARING UNIFORMS" AS WELL AS "OTHER INDISCRIMINATE ACTS OF
VIOLENCE, ESPECIALLY BOMBINGS" BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES DURING
THE OFFENSIVE BEGUN BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   IT ALSO URGED THE COUNCIL TO WORK FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE IN EL
SALVADOR AND FOR THE RESUMPTION OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE FMLN AS "THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE" THE SALVADORAN CRISIS AND AS
AN "UNPOSTPONABLE STEP" TO CONSOLIDATE THE REGIONAL PEACE PROCESS.

   THE DRAFT RESOLUTION REITERATED THE COUNCIL'S SUPPORT FOR THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENTS AND, IN CLEAR REFERENCE TO THE
UNITED STATES, IT URGED THE COUNTRIES WITH LINKS OR INTERESTS IN THE
REGION NOT TO INTERVENE IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.

   ACCORDING TO NICARAGUA, THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD ALSO EXPRESS
ITS SATISFACTION WITH THE FORTHCOMING DEPLOYMENT OF THE UN OBSERVER
GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA [ONUCA].

   THE FIRST GROUP FROM ONUCA IS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE ON SUNDAY IN
TEGUCIGALPA, WHERE ITS HEADQUARTERS WILL BE LOCATED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN REBELS HAVE FIRED TWO
SOVIET - MADE SURFACE - TO - AIR MISSILES SINCE THEY STARTED THEIR
OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER. ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE MISSILES, WHICH
"MISSED," WERE FIRED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] IN ZACATECOLUCA, IN THE REGION'S CENTER, WHERE CLASHES BETWEEN
THE ARMY AND THE REBELS CONTINUED TODAY.

   CRISTIANI ADMITTED HE IS CONCERNED OVER "THE FMLN'S PLANS FOR
STRICTLY TERRORIST ACTIONS," SUCH AS "KILLING PERSONALITIES,
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND RELATIVES OF ARMED FORCES OFFICERS."

   HE ALSO SAID HIS GOVERNMENT HAS NOT REQUESTED ANY INTERNATIONAL
MILITARY AID BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES "CAN COUNTERACT THE FMLN
ATTACKS" AND BECAUSE "THE GUERRILLA THREAT OF TAKING POWER IN THE
COUNTRY BY FORCE IS NOT REAL."

   CRISTIANI ALSO SAID HE IS WILLING TO TALK WITH THE GUERRILLAS ONLY
"IF HOSTILITIES CEASE."  HE ASSERTED THAT THE FMLN ACTIONS "ARE LINKED
TO DOMESTIC EVENTS IN NICARAGUA AND CUBA."

   THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS "COMPLETELY SURE THE ARMED FORCES CAN
CONTROL THE SITUATION BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS ARE UNABLE TO SEIZE POWER
BY FORCE AND DO NOT HAVE EVEN THE LEAST SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE."

   CRISTIANI POINTED OUT: "WE CANNOT GIVE THE FMLN ANY CHANCES BECAUSE
IT IS A MINORITY ARMED GROUP AIDED BY NICARAGUA AND CUBA, A GROUP
WHUICH INTENDS TO SEIZE SOMETHING THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO."

   "IF THE GUERRILLAS WANT TO DIALOGUE, LET THEM STOP THEIR ARMED
ACTIONS. IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WANT
PEACE," THE PRESIDENT SAID.

   HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT "THE COFFEE, SUGAR, AND COTTON CROPS," THE
COUNTRY'S MAIN EXPORT PRODUCTS, "WILL BE HARVESTED WITH ARMY
RESERVISTS."

   THE GOVERNMENT HEADED BY CRISTIANI, WHICH TODAY COMPLETED 6 MONTHS,
HAS ESTIMATED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION IN ECONOMIC LOSSES RESULTING
FROM THE BLOODY CLASHES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE REBELS SINCE 11
NOVEMBER.

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 (DIARIO LATINO) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE EMILIO
PONCE HAS SAID THAT IN LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE USE OF MISSILES BY
THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], THE SALVADORAN AIR
FORCE IS TAKING PRECAUTIONS AND HAS CHANGED ITS FLIGHT TACTICS OR ADOPTED
NEW ONES.

   "THE ARMED FORCES IS DETERMINED TO CONFRONT THEM, AND TO ACHIEVE
THEIR GOAL THE REBELS WILL HAVE TO STEP OVER THE BODIES OF EVERY
SINGLE SOLDIER," COL PONCE SAID.

   COL PONCE ALSO SAID THAT THE ARREST OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER JEAN
CASOLO, WHO WAS COVERING UP AN FMLN SAFEHOUSE, IS A HARD BLOW TO THE
TERRORISTS BECAUSE CASOLO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING CONGRESSIONAL
STAFF AND REPRESENTATIVES OF CHURCHES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS INTO THE
COUNTRY.  THESE PEOPLE APPARENTLY CAME TO THE COUNTRY TO PROVIDE
HUMANITARIAN AID TO THE DISPLACED.

   PONCE ALSO SAID THAT MANY INTERNATIONALISTS JOIN THE TERRORIST
GROUPS, THUS VIOLATING THE RIGHTS OF ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  PONCE
SAID THAT THE LEADERS OF THE FRONT GROUPS DEFINED THEIR POSITIONS WHEN
THEY JOINED THE FMLN TO CARRY OUT THE SO-CALLED FINAL OFFENSIVE, WHICH
HAS PROVEN TO BE A TOTAL FAILURE BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BELIEVE
IN DEMOCRACY AND NOT COMMUNISM.

   THE CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF ALSO MET WITH FOREIGN
CORRESPONDENTS. HE SAID THAT THE FMLN CURRENTLY HAS THE SUPPORT OF
ONLY NICARAGUA, CUBA, AND RUSSIA [AS PUBLISHED ], BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE
THE ESSENTIAL SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE; THEREFORE, THYE ARE
DOOMED TO POLITICAL-MILITARY FAILURE.  ALL THE FMLN HAS LEFT IS ITS
PROPAGANDA TACTICS AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.

   COL PONCE TALKED ABOUT THE CASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE FMLN
TERRORISTS THROUGH 0600 [1200 GMT] ON 28 NOVEMBER.  PONCE SAID THAT
1,680 REBELS HAD BEEN KILLED AND MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT NUMBER WOUNDED.
COL PONCE ADDED THAT THE ARMY REGRETS THE HEROIC DEATHS OF 398
SOLDIERS AND APPROXIMATELY 800 WOUNDED IN CLASHES SINCE 11 NOVEMBER.

PEOPLE.  IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT LABOR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE UNTS
[NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS], CRIPDES [CHRISTIAN COMMITTEE FOR
DISPLACED SALVADORANS], FECMASAN, AND OTHERS ARE SIMPLY POLITIAL FRONTS OF
THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] BECAUSE THEIR LEADERS
HAVE DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE TERRORIST OFFENSIVE AGAINST HONEST AND
HARD-WORKING CITIZENS.

   AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS UNTS TERRORIST GUILLERMO ROJAS, WHO LED TO
THEIR DEATHS MANY YOUTHS WHO WERE DECEIVED WITH FALSE COMMUNIST
MOTTOS.  THESE PEOPLE WILL HAVE ON THEIR CONSCIENCES -- IF THEY HAVE
ANY -- THE SPILLED BLOOD OF CHILDREN, YOUNG PEOPLE, ELDERLY PEOPLE,
AND WOMEN WHO FELL VICTIM TO THE ABUSES OF THESE VILE MURDERERS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 DEC 89 (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [TEXT] THE NATIONAL
GUARD HAS CAPTURED THE ACTUAL PERPETRATORS, AS WELL AS ACCOMPLICES AND
HARBORERS, IN THE CASE OF THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF
STAFF ON 30 OCTOBER.

   THE NATIONAL GUARD REPORTED THAT IT ARRESTED 15 PEOPLE LAST WEEK AT
VARIOUS PLACES IN HERE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER PERSONS AT THE
OFFICES OF THE SO-CALLED AWARENESS FOR SPIRITUAL AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY
OF MAN [CONCIENTIZACION PARA RECUPERACION ESPIRITUAL Y ECONOMICA DEL
HOMBRE, CREDHO], AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH ON 63 SOUTH AVENUE AND
OLIMPICA AVENUE IN SAN SALVADOR.  SEVERAL PERSONS WHO WERE HELD
HOSTAGE THERE ON 30 OCTOBER LATER APPEARED AT THE CENTRAL POLICE
HEADQUARTERS TO REPORT THE ABUSE.

   WHEN NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL BEGAN THE SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION
THAT SAME DAY, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE ARRESTED PERSONS HAD
COMMITTED OTHER ACTIONS IN VIOLATION OF OUR LAWS AND AGAINST THE
COUNTRY'S SECURITY.  AFTER DETERMINING THAT THIS EPISCOPAL CHURCH WAS
VISITED BY PERSONS INVOLVED IN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES AND THAT IT
HARBORED A GROUP THAT IS AN FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] FRONT, THE PLACE WAS SEARCH AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT,
IN ADDITION TO THE CHURCH, OFFICES OF CREDHO ALSO OPERATED THERE --
CREDHO IS AN AFFILIATE OF AN ORGANIZATION THEY CALL DIACOMIAS; THAT
60 PERSONS ARE EMPLOYED THERE; THAT MOST OF THOSE PERSONS ARE NOT
PARISHIONERS, BUT CREDHO EMPLOYEES; THAT CREDHO'S DIRECTOR IS A PRIEST
OF SPANISH ORIGIN NAMED LUIS SERRANO LORENTE; AND THAT THIS PRIEST IS
NOW A NATURALIZED SALVADORAN.

   THERE THE NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL ARRESTED JOSE HORACIO GUZMAN
RIVAS, JOSE EDUARDO SANCHEZ CASTILLO, LUIS GUSTAVO LOPEZ MAGANA, JOSE
VIDAL ENAMORADO DIAZ, ELBA RUTH ALFARO VALENCIA, ALEX ANTONIO TOVAR
FLORES, JOSE CANDELARIO AGUILAR ALVAREZ, AND RANDOLFO CAMPO BENAVIDES.
IN CONNECTION WITH THE SAME CASE, THEY ALSO ARRESTED JUAN ANTONIO
VERSICO NUNEZ, ANA JULIO RODRIGUEZ, AND JOSE FRANCISCO PASTORANGES
AT VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CIUDAD SATELITE NEIGHBORHOOD.  LATER ON, LUIS
SERRANO LORENTE, PASTOR OF THIS ANGLICAN CHURCH, WAS ARRESTED IN THE
LOMAS VERDES NEIGHBORHOOD.  JULIO CESAR CASTRO RAMIREZ AND JULIO
EUGENIA AGUILERA ESCOBAR WERE LATER ARRESTED IN SANTA ANA, AND,
LASTLY, AIDA MARGARITA GOMEZ DE LEON WAS ARRESTED IN THE DON BOSCO
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN SANTA TECLA.

   SERRANO SAID HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF CREDHO AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
AFOREMENTIONED CHURCH.  HE ASSERTED THAT HE LEARNED ON 29 OCTOBER THAT
IN THE CHURCHYARD TWO TRUCKS WERE LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES, WHICH WERE
HURLED THE NEXT DAY AT THE MILITARY COMPLEX OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT
CHIEFS OF STAFF.  HE DECIDED TO REMAIN SILENT ABOUT THIS, THEREBY
COVERING FOR THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS WHO MURDER HUMBLE WORKING PEOPLE.
SERRANO ALSO SAID THAT CREDHO IS FINANCED BY A FRONT GROUP CALLED
DIACOMIAS, WHICH HAS NO LEGAL STATUS, BUT IS THE CHANNEL FOR AID
THAT IS SENT IN CASH BY SO-CALLED SOLIDARITY CHURCHES AND ASSOCIATIONS
ORGANIZED IN SWEDEN, BRITAIN, NETHERLANDS, CANADA, THE UNITED STATES,
AND AUSTRALIA.  THIS MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED TO LUTHERAN, CATHOLIC,
EMANUEL BAPTIST, AND EPISCOPAL CHURCHES, AS WELL AS TO THE FOUNDATION
FOR PROMOTION OF COOPERATIVES [FUNDACION PROMOTORA DE COOPERATIVAS,
FUNPROCOOP] AND THE FEDERATION OF COOPERATIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT
[FEDERACION DE COOPERATIVAS PARA EL DESARROLLO, FEDECOOPADE].  THESE
GROUPS COMPRISE DIACOMIAS AND TWICE A MONTH, ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM
EACH GROUP MEETS AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH TO DISCUSS DISTRIBUTION OF
THESE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY, MOST OF WHICH, HE SAID, IS DELIVERED TO
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY HAVE ORGANIZED THAT ARE DIRECTED BY THE
FMLN FRONT GROUPS.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 1 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FELLOW PATRIOTS, I AM ADDRESSING THE
NATION TODAY TO EXPLAIN THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION CONCERNING THE ISSUE
OF EXTRADITION, WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF A VERY INTENSE DEBATE LAST
NIGHT AT THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES' FIRST COMMISSION.

   A PROPOSAL WAS PUT FORWARD TO THE EFFECT THAT IN THE EXTRAORDINARY
REFERENDUM SCHEDULED FOR 21 JANUARY -- WHICH IS CONTEMPLATED IN THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THAT IS CURRENTLY IN ITS FINAL STAGES -- AN
ADDITIONAL QUESTION BE INCLUDED WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU, THE
COLOMBIAN PEOPLE, WANT COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS TO BE EXTRADITED.

   THIS QUESTION WOULD JOIN FOUR OTHER ISSUES THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN
APPROVED FOR SUBMISSION TO POPULAR CONSULTATION ON 21 JANUARY.  ON
BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER IMMEDIATELY
EXPRESSED THE DISADVANTAGES OF APPROVING THAT PROPOSAL.

   I HAVE CONSULTED WITH FORMER PRESIDENTS ALBERTO LLERAS, CARLOS
LLERAS RESTREPO, ALFONSO LOPEZ, AND JULIO CESAR TURBAY ABOUT INCLUDING
THE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM, AND THEY FEEL THAT WITH THE
CURRENT PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN DEALING SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING,
IT WOULD BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO USE THE REFERENDUM TO DECIDE ON
EXTRADITION.

   THE COUNTRY MUST NOT DECEIVE ITSELF AS TO WHERE WE WOULD BE HEADED
IF WE HELD A REFERENDUM ON THE ISSUE OF EXTRADITION, AND AS TO THE
FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH AN ACTION ON THE COUNTRY'S MORALE AND ON
DEMOCRACY'S SURVIVAL.

   INITIALLY, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT EXTRADITING COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS
FOR THEM TO STAND TRIAL IN OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT OF EXTRADITING DRUG
TRAFFICKERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES ABROAD.  EXTRADITION IS NOT
PUNISHMENT FOR SOCIETY BECAUSE IT REFERS ONLY TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS,
NEITHER IS IT AN AFFRONT TO SOVEREIGNTY, AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO
PORTRAY IT.

   EXTRADITION HAS BEEN DEALT WITH IN COLOMBIAN INTERNATIONAL
TREATIES.  THE DIRECTION OF INTERNATIONAL POLICY LIES WITHIN THE
EXCLUSIVE REALM OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, ACCORDING TO THE
CONSTITUTION.  CONGRESS CANNOT TAKE THE INITIATIVE OF ABOLISHING
PUBLIC EXTRADITION TREATIES BY RESORTING TO LEGISLATIVE OR CONSTITUENT
PROVISIONS.  THIS IS CLEAR IN LIGHT OF COLOMBIAN PUBLIC LAW, AND IT IS
IMPERATIVE ACCORDING TO THE VIENNA CONVENTION, WHICH COLOMBIA RECENTLY
APPROVED.  ACCORDING TO THIS CONVENTION, THE EXTRADITION TREATY WILL
PREVAIL OVER INTERNAL PROVISIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE TREATIES THAT
COLOMBIA HAS SIGNED WITH REGARD TO EXTRADITION CANNOT BE DISREGARDED
THROUGH INTERNAL LEGISLATION.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS SUCH AS DENOUNCING THE TREATIES AND DIRECTLY
INFORMING THE COUNTERPART.

   FOR 100 YEARS COLOMBIAN LAW HAS AUTHORIZED THE EXTRADITION OF
CRIMINALS.  I REPEAT, 100 YEARS, SINCE 1888, AND ONLY NOW, WHEN
EXTRADITION IS APPLIED TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS, ARE THERE OBJECTIONS TO
ITS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY.  PRACTICALLY ALL THE COUNTRIES
OF THE WORLD, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTION, HAVE AND APPLY TREATIES TO
EXTRADITE TERRORISTS OR WHOMEVER COMMITS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, SUCH
AS DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, NO MORE THAN 30 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED
TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES THAT REQUESTED THE EXTRADITIONS AND COMPLIED WITH
THE NECESSARY LAWS.  THEREFORE, EXTRADITION IS NOT A GENERAL THREAT
AGAINST ALL COLOMBIANS.  IT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THE
CRIME OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ABROAD.  SECONDLY, SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID
THAT EXTRADITION HAS CREATED VIOLENCE AND, THEREFORE, WITH ITS
ELIMINATION, VIOLENCE WOULD DISAPPEAR.  NEITHER IS TRUE.

   THE VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD BEEN SUFFERED
PRIOR TO THE 1979 EXTRADITION TREATY.  AFTER THE TREATY WENT INTO
EFFECT, HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE MURDERED, INCLUDING JUSTICE
MINISTER RODRIGO LARA BONILLA.  IN DECEMBER 1986, A SUPREME COURT
DECISION LEFT THE EXTRADITION TREATY INAPPLICABLE.  IN OTHER WORDS,
AFTER THIS, WHILE EXTRADITION WAS INAPPLICABLE, ATTORNEY GENERAL
CARLOS MAURO HOYOS WAS SLAIN, BOGOTA MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA WAS
KIDNAPPED, AND NEWSMAN GUILLERMO CANO, POLITICAL LEADER JAIME PARDO
LEAL, AND HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE SACRIFICED.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 1 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] LAST YEAR, WITHOUT
EXTRADITION IN EFFECT, OVER 600 ANONYMOUS COLOMBIAN PEASANTS WERE
MURDERED IN MORE THAN 40 MASSACRES BY HIRED ASSASSINS PAID BY DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.  THERE IS EVEN MORE: LET US NOT FORGET ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR
ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA, COLONEL FRANKLYN
QUINTERO, AND SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN WHO WERE MURDERED WHEN
EXTRADITION WAS NOT IN EFFECT.  LET US NOT SAY THAT EXTRADITION HAS
BROUGHT US VIOLENCE.  A POSTER FOUND AT THE FARM RAIDED LAST WEEK,
FROM WHERE PABLO ESCOBAR ESCAPED READ: EXTRADITION IS VIOLENCE.  LET
US NOT BE FOOLED; VIOLENCE HAS BEEN USED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY
MURDERING, WHILE FLEEING FROM THE REACTION OF JUSTICE, AND
INTIMIDATING COLOMBIAN SOCIETY.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN SAID THAT
EXTRADITION IS UNDIGNIFIED BECAUSE IT SENDS COLOMBIANS ABROAD TO BE
TRIED, AND THAT IT IS MORE DIGNIFIED FOR THEM TO BE TRIED AND
CONDEMNED IN THE COUNTRY BY OUR OWN JUDGES.  THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,
HOWEVER, HAVE SENT MORE THAN 200 COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND JUDICIAL BRANCH
OFFICIALS TO THEIR GRAVE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE
MURDER OF DR GUILLERMO CANO HAS MEANT THE DEATH OF WITNESSES, JUDICIAL
OFFICIALS, AND LAWYERS AND INTIMIDATION AND THREATS TO ALL THOSE WHO
WANT TO COOPERATE WITH JUSTICE TO RESOLVE A CRIME.  HOW THEN CAN WE
BELIEVE THESE DRUG TRAFFICKERS?  CAN WE BELIEVE THAT EXTRADITION HAS
CAUSED THIS VIOLENCE?  CAN WE HAVE A FREE AND DIGNIFIED COUNTRY WITH
THESE BANDS OF MULTIMILLIONAIRE MURDERERS?

   I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS IT
HARMFUL AND DANGEROUS TO SUBMIT EXTRADITION TO A REFERENDUM.  WE KNOW
THAT EXTRADITION IS ONLY FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE
DONE AND WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING.  WE HAVE SUFFERED FROM THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS.  MANY BRAVE COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THE
SIMPLE REASON OF NOT AGREEING WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING.  DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT ON THIS TOPIC OF EXTRADITION THERE COULD BE A CLEAN ELECTORAL
CAMPAIGN, FREE FROM INTIMIDATION?  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO ARE
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN, WITHOUT FEAR, GIVE THEIR OPINION?  IT
WOULD BE A CAMPAIGN SLANTED BY TERRORISM, INTIMIDATION, AND DRUG
TRAFFICKERS' MONEY.

   THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT SUBJECT CITIZENS TO AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT
WOULD NOT BE TO CONVINCE COLOMBIANS, BUT TO INTIMIDATE THEM.  A
REFERENDUM IS FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR FREE AND SOVEREIGN DECISION
ON A TOPIC OF GENERAL INTEREST.  TO INCLUDE EXTRADITION IN THE
REFERENDUM WOULD ONLY SERVE SO THAT A HANDFUL -- LESS THAN 100 -- DRUG
TRAFFICKERS CAN, BY USING THEIR MONEY AND TERROR, INTIMIDATE PUBLIC
OPINION, THE MEDIA, AND ALL COLOMBIANS, SO AS TO AVOID BEING TRIED AND
CONDEMNED FOR CRIMES THAT THEY HAD COMMITTED ABROAD.

   CONDITIONS OF TERRORISM DO NOT ALLOW THIS TOPIC TO BE DECIDED
FREELY.  I CALL FOR GOOD SENSE, FOR SENSIBLENESS, SO THAT THE DARK
INTERESTS OF A FEW PRIVATE PEOPLE ARE NOT CONFUSED WITH THE GENERAL
INTEREST OF ALL COLOMBIANS.  I CALL FOR COLOMBIANS NOT TO ALLOW THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT ARE IN THE FINAL DISCUSSION, OR THE FIRST
REFERENDUM IN OVER 30 YEARS, TO BE USED IN AN OPPORTUNISTIC WAY TO
SERVE SELFISH INTERESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CONVINCED THAT THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND THE EXTRAORDINARY REFERENDUM WILL BE AN
IMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT FOR THE INSTITUTIONS.  THEY WILL ALLOW GREATER
PARTICIPATION BY THE PEOPLE IN STATE DECISIONS, IN CONGRESS, AND ARE
WITHOUT DOUBT A STEP TOWARD PEACE.  I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY THAT
DRUG TRAFFICKERS WANT PEACE AND TRANQUILITY.  I WANT TO SAY THAT
ELIMINATING EXTRADITION WILL NOT BRING TRANQUILITY, BUT IMPUNITY AND
MORE VIOLENCE.  THIS IS WHY IT IS ADVISABLE THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS NOT
ALLOW INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO BE ENDANGERED OR THE PEACE ACCORDS BE
PUT TO SERIOUS RISK DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN THE REFERENDUM OF A TOPIC
THAT NOT ONLY WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT WOULD BE
DANGEROUS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.

   AS IS PUBLICLY KNOWN, I WILL TRAVEL ON 3 DECEMBER AT THE OFFICIAL
INVITATION OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS PART OF COLOMBIA'S
OPENING TO THE PACIFIC.  THERE, I SHALL MEET WITH EMPEROR AKIHITO;
WITH PRIME MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU; WITH THE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS; WITH
INDUSTRIAL, POLITICAL, AND ACADEMIC LEADERS; AND WITH JAPANESE
GOVERNMENT LENDING AND TRADE ENTITIES.  THERE, I SHALL PRESENT A TRUE
PICTURE OF COLOMBIA -- A COUNTRY WITH DIFFICULTIES, BUT WITH THE
NATIONAL RESOLVE TO OVERCOME THEM.  WE ARE A COUNTRY WITH A PROMISING
FUTURE, WITH HARD-WORKING PEOPLE, AND WITH VAST NATURAL RESOURCES.  A
FEW CRIMINALS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SNATCH THAT FUTURE FROM US.  GOOD
NIGHT, AND SEE YOU SOON.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 2 DEC 89 (RADIO RELOJ NETWORK) -- [TEXT] OSCAR ORAMAS, THE

THE UNITED STATES AND THE HUNDREDS OF U.S. ADVISERS SENT TO EL SALVADOR ARE
THE CAUSE OF THE TERROR THAT SALVADORANS HAVE HAD TO ENDURE FOR MORE THAN 10
YEARS.

   ORAMAS CHARGED THAT THE U.S. ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN THE MAIN CAUSE OF
THE TORTURE, MURDERS, AND DISAPPEARANCES THAT HAVE BECOME A DAILY
OCCURRENCE IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION.

   ORAMAS ADDED THAT DESPITE THE GREAT EFFORT MADE BY THE U.S.
ADMINISTRATION TO CONCEAL ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE VIOLENCE
PREVAILING IN EL SALVADOR, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE
DECEIVED AND THE FACTS THAT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY WILL SHOW THAT THE
PEOPLES HAVE POINTED THEIR ACCUSING FINGERS AT THE UNITED STATES.

   THE CUBAN DIPLOMAT REBUTTED THE U.S. CHARGES AIMED AT SHIFTING
RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR COUNTRY FOR THE SALVADORAN SITUATION.  THE U.S.
CHARGES WERE TO BE EXPECTED, ORAMAS SAID.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 3 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] CENTRAL AMERICAN BISHOPS
ARE "VERY WORRIED" OVER THE SITUATION OF THE CHURCH AND THE PEOPLE IN EL
SALVADOR AND PANAMA, "WHO ARE ENDURING A DIFFICULT TRIAL," ACCORDING TO A
DOCUMENT ISSUED BY THE EPISCOPAL SECRETARIAT OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND PANAMA
(SEDAC).

   IN THE DOCUMENT, SIGNED BY 42 AREA BISHOPS, THE BISHOPS "EXPRESS
APPRECIATION FOR THE COURAGEOUS, EVANGELIC, AND PATRIOTIC ATTITUDE OF
THE PANAMANIAN CHURCH, GUIDED BY ITS TRUE CLERGYMEN, IN FACING THE
DOUBLE AGGRESSION THEY ARE ENDURING."

   PANAMA IS ENDURING "EXTERNAL SANCTIONS (IMPOSED BY THE UNITED
STATES) THAT IMPOVERISH THE COUNTRY, ALONG WITH THE OPEN DENIAL OF
FUNDAMENTAL GUARANTEES AND RIGHTS TO THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH THE
POLICY OF THE CURRENT PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT," THE DOCUMENT ADDS.

   REGARDING EL SALVADOR, "WE ARE HURT" BY THE SUFFERING, DEATH, AND
DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN
ENDURING FOR A DECADE.

   "THE USE OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF ARMED
GROUPS, THE INTENSE BOMBINGS OVER DENSELY POPULATED AREAS (BY THE
ARMY), AND THE USE OF THE MEDIA TO STIR UP PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND
INCREASE HATRED AMONG BROTHERS ARE ALL REPULSIVE," THE SEDAC DOCUMENT
STATES.

   THE SEDAC RECALLS THAT AMONG THE WAR VICTIMS ARE SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS, WHO, FROM THEIR TEACHING PODIUMS, TRIED TO SHAPE MORAL AND
JUST CONSCIENCES AMONG THE FUTURE BUILDERS OF SOCIETY.  IT ALSO
CONDEMNS THE "BRUTAL WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE MASSACRED, WHICH PROVES
HOW FAR DOWN THE MORAL SENSE AND HUMAN QUALITY OF THOSE WHO
PERPETRATED THE CRIME HAS FALLEN."

   REGARDING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, THE HIGHEST RANKING LEADERS OF
THE CHURCH IN THE AREA POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE MANY FACTORS
PREVENTING OR HAMPERING EFFORTS TO BUILD A LONG LASTING PEACE.

   AMONG THE FACTORS THE BISHOPS MENTION IS "THE PERSISTENCE OF
SERIOUS SOCIAL PROBLEMS -- HUNGER, UNEMPLOYMENT, THE HIGH COST OF
LIVING, AND THE REALITY OF AN UNDERPRIVILEGED CLASS -- YET MOST RULERS
AND OTHER BODIES HOLDING POWER DO NOT SHOW ANY DESIRE TO ELIMINATE
THESE FACTORS."

   IN ADDITION, THE "CRIMINAL STUBBORNNESS" OF SEARCHING FOR A
MILITARY AND ARMED SOLUTION TO THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE HAS GENERATED
"THE DEEPLY ROOTED UNJUSTICE IN OUR REALITY, WHICH IS AGGRAVATED BY
THE OUTRAGEOUS MEDDLING OF FOREIGN SUPERPOWERS."

   "THE INTEREST OF A GROUP OR IDEOLOGIES PREVAIL OVER THE NEEDS AND
RIGHTS OF CITIZENS," THE SEDAC DOCUMENTS STATES.  THE HEADS OF THE
CHURCHES OF THE SIX ISTHMIAN COUNTRIES ADD THAT THIS HASTENS THE
"CRIMINAL AND IMMORAL" ARMS BUILDUP, WHICH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
COSTA RICA, HAS LED PEOPLE IN THE AREA INTO INCREASING IMPOVERISHMENT
AND A RISE IN THEIR FOREIGN DEBT.

   "THE SMUGGLING OF WEAPONS TO STRENGTHEN SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS OF
VARIOUS TENDENCIES IS NO LESS OUTRAGEOUS AND CRIMINAL THAN THE
EXISTENCE OF DEATH SQUADS OR PARAMILITARY GROUPS," THE SEDAC DOCUMENT
ADDS.

   IT IS WORRYING TO SEE HOW SOME NATIONS IN THE AREA PROMOTE
CAMPAIGNS SUCH AS "AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH"
(PANAMA), OR PROMOTE "ANTITERRORIST" LAWS (EL SALVADOR) THAT CAN BE
USED FOR THE OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE OF POWER IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE
ADVERSARIES, THE BISHOPS POINTED OUT.

   TO ALL THESE EVILS ONE MUST ADD THE FLIGHT OF CAPITAL, THE
INCREASING DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THE RESULTING CORRUPTION, VIOLENCE,
AND DEATH.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] NOW THEY ARE STILL DOING THE SAME THING, EXCEPT THAT THE
KILLINGS ARE THOSE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE PLACES BURNED ARE HOMES IN THE
DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE UN HEADQUARTERS, AND THOSE ACCUSED
OF COLLABORATING WITH THE FMLN ARE THE EPISCOPAL CHURCHES.  THE STRATEGY IS
THE SAME.  THE FMLN CONTINUES TO STRIKE AT AND MOCK THE ARMED FORCES.  FAR
FROM DIMINISHING IN NUMBER, IT HAS INCREASED IN NUMBER.  THE PERSECUTION OF
THE CHURCH, THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS, THE PRESS CENSORSHIP, AND, ABOVE
ALL, THE APPARENT DIRECTION TAKEN BY THE SITUATION AS A RESULT OF THE ARMED
FORCES' LEADERSHIP HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED.  THE
MILITARY CONTINUES TO BE IN COMMAND, AND CRISTIANI'S MODERATION WAS BUT A
COSTLY MAKEOVER.

   THE U.S. ANALYSTS ARE BEGINNING TO REACT.  AFTER 9 YEARS OF
INVESTING AT ALL LEVELS TO PUT AN END TO THE CAPITAL AND THE PRINCIPAL
CITIES OF THE COUNTRY WITH A STRATEGIC SIEGE, WITH THE THEATER OF
OPERATIONS IN THE TROUBLE SPOTS, AND WITHOUT ANY PROSPECT OF
CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, THE ORDER OF THE DAY IN THE HALLS OF
CONGRESS IS A CHANGE OF POLICY AND THE PROMOTION OF NEGOTIATION.  ALL
THE WORLD IS SUFFERING DEEPLY, WITHOUT THE HOPE OF A CHANGE OF POLICY.
WHAT THE U.S. CONGRESS IS STUDYING IS WHETHER IT WILL CONTINUE WITH
THAT POLICY WHICH DOES NOT CHANGE AT ALL, WHICH PROTECTS THE ASSASSINS
OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE FOUR U.S. NUNS, IGNACIO ELLACURIA, AND FIVE
MORE JESUITS.  IT IS STUDYING WHETHER IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO
SUPPORT A FASCIST PARTY AND A CRIMINAL-RIDDEN ARMED FORCES AND THUS
CONDEMN THIS PART OF THE WORLD SO CLOSE TO THEIR BORDERS TO TERRIBLE
SUFFERING, OR WHETHER THE TIME OF CHANGE HAS ARRIVED IN THE UNITED
STATES.  THE POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR MUST BE CHANGED TO ACHIEVE THE
GOAL OF DEMOCRACY SO THAT PLURALISM WILL GIVE WAY TO DEMOCRACY,
JUSTICE, AND PEACE.  THE UNITED STATES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE IN EL
SALVADOR, BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO IT MUST CHANGE ITS POLICY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE
REPORTED THAT TROOPS FROM THE THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE ATONAL
BATTALION HAVE ENGAGED IN HEAVY FIGHTING WITH THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORIST CRIMINALS ON THREE OCCASIONS AS THE
LATTER HAVE TRIED TO ENTER THE CITY OF USULUTAN.

   SPOKESMEN FOR THE ATONAL BATTALION HAVE ASSERTED THAT THEIR
BATTALION INFLICTED A LARGE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES ON THE COMMUNIST
MURDERERS AND SEIZED SOVIET WEAPONS DURING THE LATEST FIGHTING.
MEANWHILE, TROOPS OF THE LEON BATTALION REPORTED THAT THEY KILLED TWO
TERRORIST CRIMINALS DURING A SKIRMISH IN LAS DELICIAS, SAN MIGUEL

SUPPLIES.  THEY ADDED THAT THE TROOPS FOUND 1 M-16 RIFLE, 1,500 ROUNDS
OF AMMUNITION, AND VARIOUS TYPES OF EXPLOSIVES ABANDONED IN EL TULAR
VILLAGE, ALSO IN SAN MIGUEL.

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CONGRATULATE THE BRAVE ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS
AND URGE THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FMLN'S MURDEROUS
TERRORISTS.

   LA PAZ, 4 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT
RESULTED IN JAIME PAZ ZAMORA'S INSTALLATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC WILL AGAIN TAKE PLACE IN THE NEXT WEEKS TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE
INSTALLED AS MAYOR OF LA PAZ.

   THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS HELD YESTERDAY DID NOT CLEARLY INDICATE WHO
WILL BE THE MAYOR OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST CITY, WHERE THE CANDIDATES
OF THE POPULIST NEW POLITICAL GROUPS AND THOSE OF THE TRADITIONAL
PARTIES RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY THE SAME NUMBER OF VOTES.

   ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL RETURNS RELEASED BY THE PRIVATE TELEVISION
CHANNELS, WHICH IN PREVIOUS ELECTIONS HAVE PROVEN TO BE VERY SIMILAR
TO THOSE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COURT, CARLOS PALENQUE, 45, A RADIO
AND TELEVISION BUSINESSMAN AND THE LEADER OF THE CONSCIENCE OF THE
FATHERLAND (CONDEPA), HAS RECEIVED MOST OF THE VOTES.

   PALENQUE RECEIVED 39.9 PERCENT OF THE VOTES CAST IN LA PAZ, THEREBY
GIVING CONDEPA 5 OF THE 13 SEATS ON THE TOWN COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ELECT
THE MAYOR OF LA PAZ ON 2 JANUARY.

   THE ALLIANCE OF THE RIGHT WING NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC ACTION (ADN)
AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT (MIR) HAS
ALSO WON FIVE TOWN COUNCIL SEATS.

   RONALD MACLEAN, 40 AND OF SCOTTISH ANCESTRY, THE MAYORAL CANDIDATE
OF THE ADN-MIR ALLIANCE, HAS OBTAINED 36.8 PERCENT OF THE VOTES IN LA
PAZ, WHERE HE HAS BEEN THE MAYOR SINCE L985.

   FAR BEHIND WERE THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION'S PARTY, THE NATIONALIST
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR), WHICH RECEIVED TWO SEATS, AND THE
POPULIST SOLIDARITY CIVIC UNION (UCS), LED BY BREWERY OWNER MAX
FERNANDEZ, WITH ONE TOWN COUNCIL SEAT.

   THE DECISION AS TO WHO WILL BE THE NEW LA PAZ MAYOR ON 2 JANUARY IS
NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE MNR, BUT ITS LEADERS DECLINED TO COMMENT ON
THEIR POSITION LAST NIGHT.

   GONZALO SANCHEZ DE LOSADA, THE LEADER OF THE MNR, LAST NIGHT SAID
ON TELEVISION: "WE MUST BE EXTREMELY SERIOUS IN SEARCHING FOR A
SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM, OR THE PEOPLE WILL TURN THEIR BACKS ON
POPULISM."

   HE SAID HIS DECISION WILL BE "A CHRISTMAS PRESENT."  HE INSISTED,
HOWEVER, THAT IN HIS OPINION THE GOVERNING ADN-MIR ALLIANCE "WILL
EASILY FIX THINGS BETWEEN THEM" BECAUSE "THEY ARE TWO OF A KIND."

   ALTHOUGH THE MNR WAS THE PARTY TO RECEIVE MOST OF THE VOTES IN THE
7 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, IT WAS DUE TO AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN TWO
OLD POLITICAL ENEMIES -- THE ADN AND MIR -- THAT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA, WHO
HAD COME THIRD IN THE ELECTIONS, WAS INSTALLED AS PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC. "IF WE APPLIED THIS SAME RULE TO THE CURRENT PROBLEM,"
SANCHEZ DE LOSADA SAID JOKINGLY, "GUIDO CAPRA (MNR CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR
OF LA PAZ) WOULD BE ELECTED."

   SANCHEZ DE LOSADA POINTED OUT THAT PALENQUE WAS ONE OF THE
SUPPORTERS OF THE ADN-MIR GOVERNING ALLIANCE, WHICH PREVENTED SANCHEZ
DE LOSADA FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT.

   ACCORDING TO THE OPPOSITION, PALENQUE'S PARTY GAINED THE LA PAZ
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (CORDEPAZ) AND "HALF A MINISTRY" (REFERRING TO
THE COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION MINISTRY) AS A RESULT OF THE
ALLIANCE.  SANCHEZ DE LOSADA WARNED THE BOLIVIAN POLITICIANS THAT
PALENQUE'S POPULIST GROUP, WHICH IS GROWING VERY FAST, HAS ITS EYES
SET "ON THE L993 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, NOT ONLY ON THE LA PAZ
MAYORSHIP."

   WHILE RESPECT WAS SHOWN TOWARD RONALD MACLEAN, THE CANDIDATE MOST
CRITICIZED BY THE MNR DURING THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS CAMPAIGN WAS
PALENQUE.

   PALENQUE STATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNCILMEN WHO ON 2 JANUARY WILL
ELECT THE NEXT MAYOR OF LA PAZ MUST "RESPECT THE WILL OF THE
MAJORITY."

   "WE HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE NO NEGOTIATION (AMONG PARTIES) AND THAT
THE DESIRE OF THE MAJORITY WILL BE RESPECTED," PALENQUE STATED.  HE IS
WELL KNOWN, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE BEARD HE WEARS, WHICH MAKES HIM
LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

   PALENQUE, WHO IS CERTAIN OF THE SUPPORT HE WILL RECEIVE FROM THE
ONLY UCS COUNCILMAN IN LA PAZ, FEARS THAT A PACT BETWEEN THE ADN-MIR
COALITION AND THE MNR WILL PREVENT HIM FROM OBTAINING THE MAYORSHIP OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT CITY IN THE COUNTRY.

   SUCH AN ALLIANCE, HOWEVER, WITH A GREATER IDEOLOGICAL BASIS THAN
ANY OTHER, WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME THE GRUDGE THAT THE MNR BEARS BECAUSE
THE ADN AND THE MIR "HAD STOLEN FROM IT" THE PRESIDENCY OF THE
REPUBLIC DURING THE LAST ELECTIONS, ACCORDING TO COMMENTATORS.

   "WE ARE GOING TO BE VERY RESPONSIBLE, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE
MOTIVATED BY PERSONAL INTERESTS OR BY ANY VENGEANCE," SANCHEZ DE
LOSADA STATED, COMMENTING ON THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE TO
DESIGNATE THE MAYOR OF LA PAZ.

   LIKE IN LA PAZ, THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE
SUPPORT IN THE OTHER MAJOR BOLIVIAN CITIES, WHERE THE COALITION CAME
IN FIRST BUT FAILED TO WIN ABSOLUTE MAJORITIES.

   THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS SUCRE, WHERE THE CANDIDATE OF THE UNITED LEFT
COALITION, RADIO REPORTER OMAR MONTALVO, OBTAINED 57.3 PERCENT OF THE
VOTES, WHICH IS SUFFICIENT TO OBTAIN THE MAYORSHIP.

   THE MOST OUTSTANDING POINTS ABOUT THE ELECTIONS WERE THE ABSTENTION
OF BETWEEN 30 AND 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTERS AND THE ALMOST ABSOLUTE
NORMALCY DURING THE ELECTIONS.

   THE STATE OF SIEGE DECREED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ON 15 NOVEMBER
DUE TO STREET CONFRONTATIONS CAUSED BY SOCIAL DISTURBANCES DID NOT
HAMPER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.

   THE TRADITIONAL RESTRICTIONS, HOWEVER, AFFECTED TRAFFIC AND
HAMPERED PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, KEEPING VOTERS FROM CASTING THEIR
VOTES. THE ABSTENTION WAS ALSO CAUSED BY THE WEARINESS OF THE VOTERS,
WHO ARE VOTING FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN 4 YEARS.

   LIMA, 28 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] DELEGATES TO A LATIN AMERICAN
CONGRESS THAT IS BEING HELD IN LIMA ON MISSING DETAINEES IN LATIN
AMERICA TODAY EXPRESSED THEIR "CONCERN" THAT THE LARGEST NUMBER OF
DETAINEES AND MISSING PEOPLE ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE COUNTRIES THAT
HAVE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS.

   "WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE GROUPS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
DISAPPEARANCES.  THESE GROUPS ARE ORGANIZED BY THE STATE ITSELF TO GET
RID OF ITS POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND THESE GROUPS ARE EQUIPPED WITH ALL
THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO ENGAGE IN ACTS OF IMPUNITY," SAID THE
CONGRESS SPOKESPERSON.

   ABOUT 200 DELEGATES FROM 12 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND FROM
EUROPEAN AND U.S. HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE
IX CONGRESS OF THE LATIN AMERICAN FEDERATION OF ASSOCIATIONS OF
RELATIVES OF MISSING DETAINEES THAT BEGAN TODAY AND WILL END ON 30
NOVEMBER IN LIMA.

   SOLA SIERRA, A MEMBER OF THE FEDERATION, HAS TOLD EFE THAT "THE ON
THE ESCALATION OF THESE PRACTICES, AND ON THE IMPUNITY PREVAILING IN
ALL COUNTRIES WHERE THIS METHOD OF REPRESSION PREVAILS."

   SIERRA, A CHILEAN CITIZEN, SAID THAT THIS YEAR THE COUNTRIES WITH
THE LARGEST NUMBER OF MISSING DETAINEES ARE COLOMBIA, EL SALVADOR,
GUATEMALA, AND PERU, "WHERE POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED."
HOWEVER, SHE FAILED TO MENTION THE NUMBER OF MISSING DETAINEES.

   SIERRA, THE CHILEAN DELEGATE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHILEAN
ASSOCIATION OF RELATIVES OF MISSING PEOPLE, SAID THAT THERE IS NO
TOTAL NUMBER OF MISSING PEOPLE, BUT THAT MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN REPORTED MISSING THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA SINCE 1981.

   "THIS FIGURE HAS INCREASED AT A FRIGHTENING RATE, AND WE REGRET
THAT THE LARGEST NUMBERS OF CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN COUNTRIES WITH
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS," SHE ADDED.

   SHE SAID THAT "NEITHER UNDER A DICTATORSHIP NOR UNDER A DEMOCRACY"
HAS THE PROBLEM OF THE MISSING DETAINEES BEEN RESOLVED BECAUSE THE
GOVERNMENT "ALWAYS MANAGE TO TALK ITS WAY OUT OF INVESTIGATING OR
PUNISHING.

   "(THE GOVERNMENTS) ARGUE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO FORGET THE PAST IN
ORDER TO BUILD THE PRESENT AND THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO RECONCILE IF
PEACE IS TO PREVAIL.  BUT HOW CAN THERE BE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION
WHILE EXTREMELY SERIOUS EVENTS LIKE THE MASSIVE KILLING OF HUMAN
BEINGS CONTINUE," SHE ADDED.

   SIERRA REGRETTED THAT "THERE IS VERY STRONG PRESS CENSORSHIP, AND,
WHAT IS WORSE, A SELF-IMPOSED CENSORSHIP [AUTOCENSURA]" IN THE
COUNTRIES WHERE MOST MISSING DETAINEES HAVE BEEN REPORTED.

   THESE SITUATIONS ALWAYS LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE STATE
THAT PROMOTES THIS ENTIRE POLICY, THAT IS TO SAY, THE USE OF STATE
TERRORISM IN COUNTRIES WHERE A STATE OF LAW, COURTS, AND ESTABLISHED
LEGAL PRACTICES PREVAIL, SIERRA COMMENTED.

   IN TODAY'S SESSION, A MEMBER OF THE PERUVIAN DELEGATION SAID THAT
OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS AT LEAST 4,000 PEOPLE, MOSTLY PEASANTS AND
ANDEAN COMMUNITY LEADERS, WHO WERE "ARRESTED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
WHO LATER DENIED IT," HAVE DISAPPEARED.

   THE MEMBER OF THE PERUVIAN DELEGATION SAID THAT, ACCORDING TO
OFFICIAL FIGURES, ABOUT 15,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AS A RESULT OF
POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU, AND THAT A "NEGLIGIBLE NUMBER" HAS BEEN
KILLED IN CLASHES.

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE GUERRILLA ATTACK LAUNCHED ON
11 NOVEMBER HAS INFLICTED 4,834 CASUALTIES ON THE SALVADORAN TROOPS AND
GUERRILLAS, ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED TODAY BY THE GOVERNMENT ARMED
FORCES.

   THE REPORT NOTES THAT, IN THE LAST 24 DAYS, 1,853 FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS AND 457 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN
KILLED, WHILE 1,183 REBELS AND 1,341 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED.

   OVER THE SAME PERIOD, THE MILITARY REPORT ADDS, THE ARMY SEIZED 900
RIFLES OF VARIOUS TYPES AND CALIBERS, INCLUDING 300 AK-47'S AND
DRAGONOVS, 140 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, AND ABUNDANT MATERIAL TO MAKE
EXPLOSIVES.

   MILITARY SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT FMLN GROUPS CLASHED WITH ARMY
TROOPS NEAR ZACATECOLUCA, A DEPARTMENT CAPITAL LOCATED 54 KM SOUTH OF
SAN SALVADOR.  THEY SAID THAT THE CLASHES LASTED SEVERAL HOURS AND
THAT THE AIR FORCE MOVED IN TO ROUT OUT THE GUERRILLAS.

   MEANWHILE, THE FMLN CLAIMED CREDIT THROUGH ITS CLANDESTINE RADIO
FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF AN ARMORED VEHICLE IN EL PUENTE JURISDICTION OF
SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.  HOWEVER,
THIS REPORT HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [EXCERPTS] SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TONIGHT CONFIRMED THAT HE WILL ATTEND THE
SPECIAL SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN COSTA RICA ON 10-11
DECEMBER.  CRISTIANI SAID OVER RADIO AND TELEVISION THAT HE WILL
ATTEND THE SUMMIT "IN DEFENSE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE" AND TO TELL
NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA THAT "UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS HIS
SENDING THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) PUPPETS
TO KILL SALVADORANS JUSTIFIED."

   CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT EL SALVADOR "HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO
FIND A SOLUTION THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS" BUT IN ALLUSION TO NICARAGUA,
HE ADDED THAT "THOSE WHO SEEK TO SIGN COMMITMENTS WITH THE REST OF THE
PRESIDENTS SHOULD ALSO FULFILL THEM."

   MEANWHILE, HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA SAID TODAY IN TEGUCIGALPA
THAT HE WAS WILLING TO ATTEND THE SUMMIT.  HOWEVER, COSTA RICAN
FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO MADRIGAL SAID IN HIS COUNTRY THAT EL SALVADOR
AND HONDURAS HAD NOT OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED THEIR ATTENDANCE.

   ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, HE WILL CONFIRM HIS ATTENDANCE ON 5
DECEMBER.

   MADRIGAL PREDICTED THAT THE SUMMIT "WILL NOT BE EASY" DUE TO THE
TOPICS THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED AND BECAUSE THE AGENDA WILL SURELY
INCLUDE THE ALLEGED NICARAGUAN ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN AND THE
DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AS REQUESTED BY NICARAGUA.

   HOWEVER, THE AGENDA IS BEING PROCESSED AND ALTHOUGH COSTA RICA
OFFERED TO HOST THE MEETING, "IT IS NOT INTERESTED IN FORCING THE
ISSUE," HE EMPHASIZED.

   MADRIGAL ADDED THAT WHAT INTERESTS COSTA RICA IS TO SERVE AS A
"BRIDGE" FOR SOLVING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND EL SALVADOR,
AND FINDING SOME FORMULA SO THAT THE SALVADORAN AND NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENTS WILL ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS.

   HE ADDED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE FIVE
COUNTRIES WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE ON THE EVE OF THE LONG-AWAITED MEETING
TO PREPARE FOR IT.

   THE COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER REPORTED THAT THEY ARE ALSO
CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF INVITING FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM OTHER
LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UN
OBSERVER GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA (ONUCA).

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] VIOLENT CLASHES BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GUERRILLA FORCES AND THE ARMY TODAY AGAIN SHOOK THE
NORTHWEST SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR, AFTER A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COLUMN RAIDED THE TOWN OF SAN ANTONIO ABAD.

   AT LEAST FIVE MILITARY AND REBEL DEATHS, THREE STORES PARTIALLY
DESTROYED, AND ONE ELECTRIC POLE BLOWN UP ARE THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS
OF THE CLASHES IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD, BETWEEN 2100 ON 4 DECEMBER AND
0200 5 DECEMBER.

   THE FMLN GUERRILLA FORCES TODAY ALSO ATTACKED ARMY POSITIONS IN
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, A WORKERS' NEIGHBORHOOD NORTH OF THE CAPITAL, AND LA
CIMA NEIGHBORHOOD, SOUTHEAST OF THE CAPITAL, WHERE THE CLASHES WERE
STILL UNDERWAY AT MID-MORNING.

   THE ARMY ADMITTED THAT ONE SOLDIER DIED AND FIVE WERE WOUNDED
DURING THE CLASHES IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD, A MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD
LOCATED BESIDE THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA; AND AT LEAST FOUR REBELS
WERE RIPPED TO PIECES BY A LAW [LIGHT AATI-TANK WEAPON] ROUND.

   LOTS OF BLOOD AND PIECES OF FLESH STUCK TO BACKPACKS AND MILITARY
UNIFORM FRAGMENTS WERE SCATTERED IN A-30 METER AREA WITHIN AN EMPTY
LOT IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF THE TOWN.

   AN OFFICER OF THE NATIONAL POLICE'S ELITE PANTERA BATTALION, WHICH
PARTICIPATED IN THE FIGHTING, TOLD AFP: "THE ROUND FELL EXACTLY WHERE
THEY WERE.  AT LEAST FOUR DIED ON THE SPOT AND MANY WERE WOUNDED."

   THE REBELS BLEW UP A GROCERY STORE AND AN ELECTRIC POLE IN DOWNTOWN
SAN ANTONIO ABAD; AND ONE DRUGSTORE AND OTHER STORES ALSO SUSTAINED
CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE DURING THE FIGHTING.

   TENSION AND NERVOUSNESS PREVAILED THIS MORNING IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD,
WHERE MANY PERSONS WERE LOOKING FOR EXPLOSIVES AND TNT LEFT BEHIND BY
THE REBELS.

   ARMY SPOKESMEN HAVE YET TO ISSUE A REPORT ON THE FIGHTING AT LA
CIMA AND AYUTUXTEPEQUE, BUT THE PEOPLE OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE SAID THERE WAS
FIERCE FIGHTING IN THE SECTOR, ADDING THAT THE REBELS ENTRENCHED
THEMSELVES INSIDE THE LOCAL CHURCH TO FIRE AT THE GOVERNMENT'S TROOPS.

   MEANWHILE, REPORTS FROM THE INTERIOR INDICATE THAT THE FIGHTING
DIMINISHED TODAY IN THE REGION OF ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND SAN
MIGUEL, WHERE THE MILITARY SITUATION WAS EXTRAORDINARILY TENSE UNTIL
THE NIGHT OF 4 DECEMBER.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT TODAY EXPLAINED THAT THE REDUCTION IN
CURFEW HOURS, FROM 2100 TO 0500 EFFECTIVE LAST NIGHT, DOES NOT APPLY
FOR THE CITY OF ZACATECOLUCA, CAPITAL OF LA PAZ DEPARTMENT -- LOCATED
IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY -- WHICH THE GUERRILLA FORCES HAVE
BEEN CONSTANTLY HARASSING THROUGHOUT THE WEEK.

   MEANWHILE, THE FMLN WARNED THE OWNERS OF COMMERCIAL AND CROP
DUSTING AIRPLANES TO ABSTAIN FROM USING THEIR PLANMES FOR THE ARMY TO
CONDUCTRE RECONAISSANCE FLIGHTS IN THE REGION OF ZACATECOLUCA AND
USULUTAN, "BECAUSE THEY WILL BE CONSIDERED MILITARY TARGETS."

   VATICAN CITY (VATICAN CITY), 5 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] IN AN INTERVIEW
PUBLISHED IN THE RELIGIOUS MONTHLY MAGAZINE "30 GIORNI" (30 DAYS), SAN
SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS HAS ONCE AGAIN BLAMED THE
SALVADORAN ARMY FOR THE MURDER OF SIX JESUITS FROM THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY (UCA).

   RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY "ONLY
THE MILITARY COULD BE AT THE SITE."  THE ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR
UNDERLINED THAT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT "IS AN AREA HIGHLY CONTROLLED
BY THE MILITARY," THAT ON THE DAY IN QUESTION "THE CURFEW OR, IN OTHER
WORDS, MARTIAL LAW WAS IN EFFECT," AND THAT "THERE IS A MILITARY
NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE UCA."

   "ALL OF THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE NOT
RESPONSIBLE.  THE OPERATION LASTED 1/2 HOUR AND THE UNIFORMED
INDIVIDUALS STAYED THERE FOR A GOOD WHILE, 2 OR PERHAPS 3 HOURS.  HAD
THEY BEEN GUERRILLAS, THEY WOULD HAVE ATTACKED AND FLED IMMEDIATELY,"
HE ADDED.

   ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS ALSO UNDERSCORED THAT "THEY TOOK THE PRIESTS
OUT TO THE GARDEN, MURDERED THEM, EXPLODED DEVICES, BURNED THE HOUSE,
AND STAYED AT THE SITE FOR A LONG TIME," WHICH "MEANS THAT THEY FELT
SURE OF THEMSELVES."

   THE ARCHBISHOP SAID DURING THE INTERVIEW THAT "IT HAS BEEN FULLY
PROVEN" THAT THERE ARE TWO POLITICAL LINES WITHIN THE RULING ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY: "ONE HEADED BY PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI, AND ANOTHER MORE RADICAL SECTOR."

   RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS
HAVE BEEN "ELIMINATED" BY THE ARMY.  " THEY HAVE NOT ACCOMPLISHED WHAT
THEY WANTED, BUT, HE SAID, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ELIMINATED, AND THAT IS
WHY I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE BEST COURSE IS THAT OF NEGOTIATION."

   REGARDING THE LETTER SENT TO THE POPE BY EL SALVADOR'S ATTORNEY
GENERAL, IN WHICH HE ADVISES THE DEPARTURE OF A FEW BISHOPS FROM EL
SALVADOR, RIVERA Y DAMAS COMMENTED THAT IN A WAY IT WAS BENEFICIAL
BECAUSE "WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED AS MUCH SOLIDARITY OR SUPPORT AS WE
ARE RECEIVING NOW FROM THE SUPREME PONTIFF TO THE EPISCOPAL
CONFERENCES."

   RIVERA Y DAMAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT HE HAS BEEN THREATENED, NOT
ONLY BY PHONE BUT BY RADIO.

   THIS IS THE FOURTH JUDGE RIDDLED WITH BULLETS BY UNIDENTIFIED
GUNMEN -- APPARENTLY PAID ASSASSINS AT THE SERVICE OF THE DRUG
TRAFFICKING MAFIAS -- IN MEDELLIN WITHIN 5 MONTHS. JUDGE MARIA HELENA
DIAZ WAS ASSASSINATED ON 28 JULY; MEDELLIN HIGHER COURT MAGISTRATE
HECTOR JIMENEZ WAS KILLED ON 17 OCTOBER; AND MAGISTRATE MARIELA
ESPINOZA WAS KILLED ON 1 NOVEMBER.

   JARAMILLO URIBE WORKED AS JUDGE OF THE 13TH CRIMINAL COURT IN

GUATEMALA, WHERE ARMED GROUPS HAVE CONTINUED TO RUN RAMPANT, HAS BEEN THE
VICTIM OF THIS INTERCONTINENTAL INTEREST.  NICARAGUA HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY
THE SANDINIST FORCES, WHICH RECEIVE ARMS OF ALL KINDS.

   MORE ARMS THAN FOOD, MORE INSTRUCTORS THAN AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS,
AND MORE ARMS THAN FINANCE ASSISTANCE FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT KEEP
REACHING NICARAGUA.

   NICARAGUA HAS BECOME A DISTRIBUTION CENTER FOR OTHER COUNTRIES WHO
RAISE PIRATE FLAGS, COUNTRIES WHOSE LEADERS KNOW THAT THE SOVIET UNION
IS INTERESTED IN THE FIVE COUNTRIES OF THE ISTHMUS.  THIS IS WHY THE
SOVIET UNION CONTINUALLY AIDS THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.  THE
INTERRUPTION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND ARMS WOULD ENTAIL FAILURE OF
THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   OVER THE COURSE OF THE TALKS ABOARD SOVIET AND U.S. SHIPS OFF
MALTA, BUSH'S POSITION REMAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERESTS OF
BOTH THE U.S. AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES.  MANY OF THESE LATTER
COUNTRIES ARE THREATENED BY RADICAL AND CLANDESTINE MOVEMENTS.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. PRESIDENT HAS JUST TAKEN FIRM STEPS TOWARD
A DIRECT UNDERSTANDING WITH THE SOVIET UNION.  THIS MEANS THAT THE
GUERRILLAS MOVEMENTS IN SEVERAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES WILL HAVE TO
CONSENT TO CIVILIZED DIALOGUE SO THEY CAN COEXIST WITH THE MAJORITY OF
THE POPULATION, WHO DESIRE TO LIVE IN PEACE, WITH WORK AND DIGNITY.

   EL SALVADOR REPRESENTS THE MOST DANGEROUS EXAMPLE OF THIS
INTERCONTINENTAL PENETRATION.  IN THIS COUNTRY OPERATES A GUERRILLA
MOVEMENT HEAVILY SUPPLIED WITH ARMS AND AMMUNITION. THESE REBELS ARE
MILITARILY AND OTHERWISE TRAINED FOR CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS THAT SOW
TERROR IN THE THREATENED TOWNS AND VILLAGES.  THE SOVIET UNION
SUPPLIES THESE ARMS THROUGH CUBA.

   SALVADORAN PRESIDENT CRISTIANI EXPECTS THE ACCORDS REACHED BY THE
TWO WORLD LEADERS TO CUT THE SUPPLY OF WAR MATERIEL TO THE FMLN.  THIS
MATERIEL HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO KILL THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.

   WE WILL HAVE WAITED FOR THE PASSAGE OF TIME TO SEE IF IT IS TRUE
THAT THE SUPPLY OF ARMS HAS CEASED AND THAT NICARAGUA HAS STOPPED
ASSISTING THE FMLN.

   WE ONLY HOPE THE FMLN WILL NOT COME TO HONDURAS.  THE CABINETS THAT
DRAFT WAR PLANS ARE NOW CURRENTLY DISCUSSING THE FMLN'S MOVING INTO
HONDURAS.

   BOGOTA, 6 DEC 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO
TWO VERY STRONG EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED IN THE CENTER OF BOGOTA.  WE FELT THESE
EXPLOSIONS HERE AT THE RCN [RADIO CADENA NACIONAL] BUILDING. ONE OF THE
EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED IN THE VICINITY OF THE COURTS IN THE PALO QUEMADO
SECTOR, WHERE ALL THE BOGOTA JUDICIAL BRANCH OFFICES ARE LOCATED.
APPARENTLY THE OTHER EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN A STREET NEAR THE PRESIDENTIAL
PALACE.

   THERE WERE TWO EXPLOSIONS OCCURRING CONSECUTIVELY BUT VERY CLOSE
TOGETHER, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS FELT SO STRONGLY.  IT INITIALLY FELT
LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE: FIRST THE WAVE AND THEN THE EXPLOSION.  ALL THE
RESIDENTS IN THIS CENTRAL AREA OF BOGOTA FELT IT.

   IT IS ALSO SAID THAT THE EXPLOSION COULD HAVE OCCURRED CLOSER TO
THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, DAS, WHICH IS LOCATED IN
THE SAME AREA.  THE DAS HEADQUARTERS ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OFFICES IN PALO QUEMADO.  THE STRONG EXPLOSION
THAT WAS FELT BY ALL OF US WHO WORK AT THIS HOUR IN THE CENTRAL BOGOTA
AREA TOOK PLACE AT 19TH CARRERA AND 25TH STREET IN PALO QUEMADO.  I
REPEAT, TWO CONSECUTIVE EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED AT 0735 IN THE CENTER OF
BOGOTA.

   HERE IS SOME UPDATED INFORMATION: IT WAS NOT TWO EXPLOSIONS, AS WE
HAD INTIALLY BELIEVED, BUT THREE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCURRED A FEW
MINUTES AGO IN BOGOTA. ONE OF THEM WAS IN THE PALO QUEMADO SECTOR, AS
WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, IN THE AREA WHERE BOTH THE BOGOTA COURTS AND
DAS ARE LOCATED.  ANOTHER EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF
BOGOTA AT 14TH CARRERA AND 28TH STREET SOUTH, APPARENTLY NEAR AN
AGRARIAN TRUST BRANCH IN THE BARRIO GUSTAVO RESTREPO NEIGHBORHOOD.  A
THIRD EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE CENTRAL AREA OF BOGOTA.  THESE THREE
EXPLOSIONS IN BOGOTA TOOK PLACE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY, JUST A FEW
SECONDS APART.

   WE NOW HAVE OFFICIAL FIGURES OF THE EXPLOSION NEAR THE DAS
HEADQUARTERS: SEVEN PERSONS WERE KILLED, MORE THAN 50 WERE WOUNDED,
AND APPROXIMATELY 25 VEHICLES AND AT LEAST 15 BUILDINGS -- INCLUDING
THE DAS OFFICES THAT WERE PARTIALLY DESTROYED -- WERE DAMAGED.
INITIALLY, DAS OFFICIALS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT A POWERFUL BOMB OF MORE
THAN 100 KG OF DYNAMITE PLACED IN A TRUCK WAS ACTIVATED.

   THE HUGE EXPLOSION CAUSED THE INITIAL DESTRUCTION OF THE FRONT PART
OF THE DAS HEADQUARTERS, AS WELL AS A BUILDING WHERE THERE WAS A
HARDWARE STORE, AND THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF SIX OR SEVEN OTHER
BUILDINGS.  A CRATER 15 METERS WIDE AND 6 METERS DEEP WAS CREATED IN
27TH CARRERA.

   MOST OF THE VICTIMS OF THE EXPLOSION WERE IN PRIVATE VEHICLES AND
TAXIS, AND ONLY FOUR WERE WALKING IN THE AREA WHEN THE EXPLOSION
OCCURRED AT ALMOST 0740.  OFFICIALS SAY INITIALLY THAT THERE WERE 50
PERSONS, HIT BY GLASS SHARDS AND FLYING PIECES OF VEHICLES, INJURED IN
THE EXPLOSION.  OFFICIALS HAVE INDICATED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE
NUMBER OF VICTIMS WILL INCREASE, AS THE ATTACK AGAINST THE DAS
HEADQUARTERS WAS VERY STRONG.  WE REPEAT: OFFICIALLY, SEVEN PERSONS
WERE KILLED HERE IN FRONT OF THE DAS HEADQUARTERS.

   SANTIAGO, 5 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] ADMIRAL JOSE TORIBIO
MERINO CASTRO TODAY STATED THAT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT JUNTA HAS DECIDED TO
MEET TWICE A WEEK, TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS, IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE HANDLING
OF DRAFT LAWS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION.  ASKED ABOUT THE POLITICAL
SITUATION IN CHILE, MERINO SAID THAT EVERYTHING IS CALM.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE POLITICAL SITUATION IS CALM, EXCEPT
FOR THE LEFTISTS, THAT IS, NOT THE LEFTISTS IN GENERAL BUT THOSE WHO
LIKE THROWING BOMBS AND KILLING PEOPLE.  THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE
MARRING AN EXTRAORDINARILY PERFECT DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  THIS SITUATION
IS UNIQUE IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ALL THOSE WHO CAN VOTE
HAVE BEEN REGISTERED, AT LEAST 99 PERCENT OF THEM. [END RECORDING]

   ADM MERINO ADDED THAT THE PREVAILING CALM MUST CONTINUE UNDER THE
NEXT ADMINISTRATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE MUST CONTINUE IF
WE ARE TO LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY RESPECTFUL OF THE PEOPLE AND THEIR
RIGHTS.  WHAT I MEAN IS THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS RESPECT, THERE WILL
BE TRANQUILLITY. [END RECORDING]

   ADM MERINO STATED THAT THE NEW CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE BOARD WILL
ENSURE GREATER STABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN THE EXCHANGE RATE FOR FOREIGN
CURRENCIES.  ASKED ABOUT FIDEL CASTRO'S RECENT OFFER TO MEDIATE
BETWEEN CHILE AND BOLIVIA, MERINO SAID THAT THE CUBAN DICTATOR HAS NO
BUSINESS MEDDLING IN CHILE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] [WORDS INDISTICT] FIDEL CASTRO.  THIS
SCARECROW WOULD DO BETTER TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT BECAUSE HE HAS NO
BUSINESS MEDDLING IN CHILE.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] A CLEAR IDEA OF
PERESTROYKA AND THE OTHER LESSONS THAT GORBACHEV IS TEACHING [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  HE IS PROBABLY THINKING THAT BOLIVIA IS ABOUT TO FALL
INTO THE HANDS OF THE COMMUNISTS BECAUSE THOSE IN THE GOVERNMENT THERE
ARE LEANING TO THE LEFT, AND THAT CHILE WILL FOLLOW SUIT.  SO HE
FIGURES THAT HE, AS A LEFTIST, WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO MEDDLE IN
CHILEAN AFFAIRS.  NOT SO.  NOBODY EXCEPT WE CHILEANS WILL HANDLE OUR
AFFAIRS.

   THE BEST THING THIS CASTRO CAN DO IS STAY HOME.  HE ALREADY VISITED
CHILE; I MET HIM AND SO DID OTHERS.  HE SPENT A WHOLE NIGHT TALKING TO
[NAME INDISTINCT] IN PUNTA ARENAS WHEN I MET HIM.  SO HE HAS NOTHING
TO DO HERE. [END RECORDING]

   ADM MERINO CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTION HE
WILL STAY IN HIS OFFICE, JUST IN CASE.

   BOGOTA, 6 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIA'S ACTING PRESIDENT CARLOS
LEMOS HAS SAID THAT THE NARCOTERRORISTS WHO PERPETRATED AN ATTACK IN
BOGOTA TODAY THAT LEFT 31 DEAD AND MORE THAN 1,000 INJURED "DESERVE NO
MERCY FROM GOD."

   LEMOS ADMITTED THAT THE CAR BOMB ATTACK ON THE HEADQUARTERS OF
COLOMBIA'S SECRET SECURITY POLICE (DAS) IN BOGOTA "IS THE MOST SERIOUS
AND THE BLOODIEST" ATTACK EVER COMMITTED IN THE COUNTRY.

   LEMOS, FILLING IN FOR PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WHO IS ON AN
OFFICIAL VISIT TO JAPAN, TOLD AFP THAT CONTROLLING THE TERRORISTS "IS
VERY DIFFICULT" BECAUSE "THEY ENJOY THE ADVANTAGE OF SURPRISE."

   THE ACTING PRESIDENT POINTED OUT THAT "THE AUTHORITIES CANNOT GUARD
EVERY METER OF THE CITY STREETS."

   LEMOS SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP SECURITY THROUGHOUT
THE CAPITAL, AND ADDED THAT A "HEAD-ON" STRUGGLE WILL BE WAGED AGAINST
THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   "THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY FOR A TRUCE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS," THE
ACTING MINISTER SAID.  HE POINTED OUT THAT "THE SLAUGHTER," WHICH HE
HAD WARNED ABOUT LAST WEEK BEFORE THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES, IS
NOW UNDER WAY.

   LEMOS HAS OPPOSED THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADICTION TO THE UNITED
STATES OF COLOMBIANS CHARGED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING IN A REFERENDUM
SCHEDULED FOR 21 JANUARY.

   LEMOS SEIZED THAT OPPORTUNITY TO URGE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS (CHAMBER
AND SENATE) TO KEEP EXTRADICTION AS A TOOL TO PUNISH DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   A GROUP OF PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE INSISTED ON INTRODUCING THE
EXTRADICTION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM.  THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT
THIS IS A PERNICIOUS ACTION, BECAUSE IT COULD INCREASE THE TERRORISM
THAT IS SCORCHING THE COUNTRY.

   "THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE DEPRIVED OF A TOOL SUCH AS
EXTRADICTION," LEMOS CONCLUDED.

   LAST NIGHT THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES SURPRISINGLY APPROVED A
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE THE EXTRADICTION ISSUE IN THE
REFERENDUM.

   LA PAZ, 27 NOV 89 (EL DIARIO) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED BY
THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS COMMISSION, DRUG TRAFFICKING
IS ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS IN BOLIVIA PREVENTING A SOCIAL EXPLOSION BECAUSE
IT CONTRIBUTES 20 PERCENT OF THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES.

   "THE BOLIVIAN LABOR FORCE IS OFFICIALLY MADE UP OF 1.7 MILLION
PEOPLE.  THE DRUG BUSINESS PROVIDES ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE OR FOUR
JOBS," THE REPORT STATES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DATA OBTAINED FROM
GOVERNMENT CIRCLES.

   IT ADDS THAT THE COCAINE "BOOM" IN BOLIVIA COINCIDED WITH THE TOUGH
ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED SINCE 1981 AND THAT THE
"COCA-DOLLARS" HAVE CUSHIONED THE SOCIAL EXPLOSION.

   "LIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS, COCAINE TRAFFICKING ACQUIRES SYSTEMS OF
CAPITAL AND DISTRIBUTION.  IT ALSO HAS FIXED EXPENDITURES.  THESE
"INVESTMENTS" INCLUDE RAW MATERIAL (COCA LEAVES), CHEMICAL PRODUCTS
AND LABORATORIES, CHEMISTS, TRANSPORTATION, SERVICES (LEGAL AND
FINANCIAL), AND SECURITY, WHICH INCLUDES PAYMENTS OF TIPS TO PUBLIC
OFFICIALS, POLITICIANS, JUDGES, AND POLICEMEN.  IN SOME COUNTRIES THE
GUERRILLAS ARE PAID TO PROVIDE PROTECTION," THE COMMISSION'S REPORT
STATES.

   THE COMMISSION REPORTS THAT SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA HAS BECOME A
PROSPEROUS TOWN PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE DRUG TRADE.  "ONE OF THE
CLEAREST EFFECTS RECORDED IN THE THREE COCAINE AREAS IS THAT IT
PROVIDES JOB OPPORTUNITIES," THE REPORT STATES.  IT ADDS THAT BETWEEN
750,000 AND 1.1 MILLION PEOPLE ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED IN THE DRUG
BUSINESS IN BOLIVIA.

   IT STATES THAT COCA LEAF PRODUCTION IS WHAT PROVIDES MOST OF THE
JOB OPPORTUNTIES IN THIS BUSINESS.  ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, 500,000
PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED EXCLUSIVELY IN COCA LEAF PRODUCTION.

   THE NUMBER OF PRODUCERS IN THE CHAPARE REGION IS ESTIMATED AT
36,864, AND THEY ARE LINKED IN 6 FEDERATIONS, 54 ASSOCIATIONS
[CENTRALES], AND 610 UNIONS.  IN THE YUNGAS ZONE OF LA PAZ, THE NUMBER
OF PRODUCERS IS ESTIMATED AT 26,280, ORGANIZED INTO 4 FEDERATIONS, 14
ASSOCIATIONS, AND 650 COLONIES OR COMMUNITIES.

   THE COCA CROP IS ESTIMATED TO BE 45,100 HECTARES (DATA FROM 1988)
IN THE CHAPARE ZONE AND 19,695 HECTARES IN THE YUNGAS AREA OF LA PAZ.

   THE ESTIMATED COCA PRODUCTION IN THE CHAPARE AND YUNGAS REGIONS
AMOUNTS TO 117,486 AND 73,634 TONS PER YEAR, RESPECTIVELY.

   THE OFFICIAL REPORT ADDS THAT 12,381 TONS OF COCA WERE EARMARKED
FOR CHEWING AND THAT 132,038.3 TONS WERE USED TO PRODUCE COCAINE.

   SANTIAGO, NO DATE (RADIO CHILENA NETWORK) -- [INTERVIEW WITH AYLWIN
BY SOLA] [EXCERPTS] [CONTINUED] [SOLA] RELATIONS BETWEEN CHILE AND
BOLIVIA HAVE BEEN BROKEN.  WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST WAY TO FACE
BOLIVIA'S DEMAND FOR A SEA OUTLET?

   [AYLWIN] FIRST, CHILE MAINTAINS A FIRM STAND ON THIS SUBJECT, A
FACT THAT MUST BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE AND THE
REST OF THE WORLD.  CHILE DOES NOT HAVE ANY BORDER CONFLICTS WITH
BOLIVIA.  OUR BORDER WITH BOLIVIA HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY AN
INTERNATIONAL TREATY THAT WAS FREELY APPROVED BY OUR TWO COUNTRIES.
THIS TREATY CONSTITUTES AN OBLIGATORY NORM FOR CHILE AND BOLIVIA.

   SECOND, ACCORDING TO THIS TREATY, CHILE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO
GRANT BOLIVIA TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES TO PORTS ON THE PACIFIC COAST.

   THIRD, IN FACE OF THE BOLIVIAN ASPIRATIONS TO OBTAIN GREATER
FACILITIES OR A NEW TRANSIT SYSTEM, THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE IS TO
REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  THIS IS A BILATERAL ISSUE BETWEEN
BOLIVIA AND CHILE.  IT IS NOT AN HEMISPHERIC MATTER OR A MATTER TO BE
DECIDED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.

   I TRUST THAT BOLIVIA AND CHILE WILL REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION.  WE MUST BE
AWARE THAT THE WORLD IS HEADING TOWARD INTEGRATION AND THAT IT IS MORE
CONVENIENT FOR ALL OF US TO ATTAIN THE BEST AND MOST INTEGRATED
RELATIONS POSSIBLE.  WE MUST SEEK SOLUTIONS AND, AS THE BOLIVIAN
PRESIDENT RECENTLY STATED, WE MUST SEEK IMAGINATIVE SOLUTIONS WITH A
21ST CENTURY AND NOT A 19TH CENTURY VIEW.  I HOPE THAT WITHIN THIS
SPIRIT WE WILL MANAGE NOT ONLY TO REESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH BOLIVIA,
BUT TO ESTABLISH SATISFACTORY RELATIONS FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES.

   [SOLA] CHILEAN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOT BEEN
EXCELLENT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE MURDER OF ORLANDO LETELIER
IS TIED INTO THIS SITUATION.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT,
CONSIDERING THAT A U.S. COURT HAS REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF GENERAL
CONTRERAS AND COLONEL ESPINOZA?

   [AYLWIN] WELL, I HOPE THAT CHILE WILL MAINTAIN THE BEST RELATIONS
POSSIBLE WITH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED
STATES, A COUNTRY WITH WHICH WE ARE LINKED FOR MANY REASONS.  I
DISCUSSED THIS SUBJECT WITH PEOPLE FROM U.S. DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL,
AND ECONOMIC CIRCLES, AND I HAVE NOTED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE
RELATIONS AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY SEPARATING US AS
SOON AS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IS REESTABLISHED.

   I DO NOT THINK THAT AN EXTRADITION WILL SOLVE THE LETELIER CASE
BECAUSE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN RULED ON BY THE SUPREME COURT.  IT IS WHAT
WE LAWYERS REFER TO AS AN ADJUDGED MATTER.  I THINK THAT CHILE CAN
DEMONSTRATE ITS WILLINGNESS TO HELP CLARIFY THE CASE AND GUARANTEE
JUSTICE, AS IT IS OUR [WORD INDISTINCT] PURPOSE IN ALL HUMAN RIGHTS
PROBLEMS, SO AS TO SATISFY THE MOST DEMANDING CONSCIENCES OF THE
WORLD. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF OF
THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, BY UNIDENTIFIED SALVADORAN AND
INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS] [TEXT] [PONCE, IN PROGRESS] ...THE OFFENSIVE
OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] AS OF 11
NOVEMBER HAS BEEN MILITARILY DEFEATED HERE IN THE CITY OF SAN
SALVADOR, AS WELL AS IN SAN MIGUEL, USULUTAN, AND ZACATECOLUCA, WHERE
THERE WAS GREATER ACTIVITY BY THE SUBVERSIVES.  LOGICALLY, AFTER BEING
REJECTED SO MUCH, AFTER HAVING LOST SO MANY FIGTHERS AND WAR MATERIEL,
THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO AGAIN LAUNCH AN OPERATION LIKE THEY
DID ON 11 NOVEMBER.  THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM
AND SELECTIVE TERRORISM.  WE HAVE HERE SOME OF THE FIRST EVIDENCE.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE MURDER OF A PERSON USEFUL TO SALVADORAN SOCIETY LIKE
DR GUERRERO, THE ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, THE
DESTRUCTION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.  WE CAN ALSO MENTION THE
DESTRUCTION OF SOME GASOLINE STATIONS.  BASICALLY, WHAT THEY SEEK IS
TO SYSTEMATICALLY DESTROY THE ECONOMY OF THE COUNTRY, TO PROVOKE THE
CLOSING OF SOME INDUSTRIAL CENTERS, AND TO BRING ABOUT ECONOMIC CHAOS.

   THAT IS WHY, EVEN THOUGH WE BELIEVED WE WERE TAKING RISKS IN THE
MILITARY FIELD OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, THE ARMED FORCES CHANGED THE
CURFEW HOURS, SO THAT CURFEW HOURS ARE NOW FROM 2300 TO 0500.  WE DID
THIS BELIEVING THAT THE ECONOMIC ASPECT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE
COUNTRY, AND THAT IS WHY WE WANT TO BENEFIT THE INDUSTRIAL, BUSINESS,
AND FARMING SECTORS, SO THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THEIR
ACTIVITIES UNDER ALMOST NORMAL CONDITIONS.

   WE ALSO CONSIDERED THAT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR WE ARE PICKING COFFEE
AND COTTON AND HARVESTING SUGARCANE, AND THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN
STAPLES OF OUR ECONOMY.  THESE ACTIVITIES ARE MAINLY CARRIED OUT IN
THE EVENING, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE CHANGED THE CURFEW HOURS TO
BENEFIT BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND FARMERS SO THEY CAN SUPPORT THEIR
FAMILIES.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK THAT DURING THE COSTA
RICAN MEETING ENOUGH PRESSURE CAN BE EXERTED ON NICARAGUA SO THAT IT
WILL SUSPEND ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN AND THE WAR WILL DIMINISH IN THE
COUNTRY?

   [PONCE] THE CYNICISM OF THE DICTATOR ORTEGA OF THE SANDINIST
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FULLY PROVEN.  IN THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF ESQUIPULAS II, HE COMMITTED HIMSELF TO DISCONTINUING
SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN.  THIS TOTAL WAR OFFENSIVE THAT HAS BEEN
INFLICTED UPON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUSPENDED, BECAUSE WE
ARE SURE THAT THE MOMENT NICARAGUA AND CUBA -- IT IS THROUGH THOSE
COUNTRIES, RATHER THOSE GOVERNMENTS THAT THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS BEEN
HELPING THE FMLN -- THE FMLN WOULD WEAKEN TREMENDOUSLY.  [SENTENCE AS
HEARD]

   AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES, AS A MEMBER OF THE HIGH COMMAND, I
FEEL VERY PROUD ABOUT THE PROFESSIONAL, DETERMINED, AND COURAGEOUS
ATTITUDE WITH WHICH THE OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND
TROOPS OF OUR ARMED FORCES HAVE NEUTRALIZED AND DEFEATED THE FMLN
OFFENSIVE.  IN THIS REGARD, I BELIEVE THAT THE OPINIONS VOICED BY
GENERAL THURMAN ARE NOT REALLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HAVE LIVED HERE
INSIDE THE COUNTRY.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 6 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] COMPATRIOTS, AS YOU KNOW, I CAME TO
JAPAN TO FULFILL A MISSION IN THIS COUNTRY, WHICH HAS ALWAYS EXPRESSED
ITS SOLIDARITY WITH COLOMBIA.

   I HAVE BEEN, HOWEVER, CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION
WITH DEEP SADNESS AND INDIGNATION AFTER THE CRIMINAL ATTACK ON THE DAS
[ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] FACILITIES, WHICH
DEEPLY SHOOK ALL COLOMBIANS.

   I HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONS, THE
MINISTER DESIGNATED TO ACT ON MY BEHALF AND WITH MY CLOSEST
ASSISTANTS.

   IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE VILE
ATTACKS CARRIED OUT BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION.
THOSE ATTACKS HAVE TAKEN THE LIFE OF MANY INNOCENT COLOMBIANS.  MEN,
WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, WHO WERE IN THE PRIME OF THEIR LIVES, HAVE BEEN
SACRIFICED BY MAD ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY CRIMINALS, WHO INTEND TO
CONTROL AN ENTIRE PEOPLE, GOVERNMENT, AND COUNTRY THROUGH TERROR AND
DESTRUCTION.

   THEY WILL NOT DEFEAT US.  WE ARE AND WILL CONTINUE STRUGGLING.  THE
WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED ON THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND ON DEMOCRACY.  WE WILL
NOT FALL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE NARCOTERRORISTS' BLOODY TYRANNY.

   LAST NIGHT, THE COUNTRY LEARNED ABOUT THE COLOMBIAN CHAMBER OF
REPRESENTATIVES'S DECISION TO APPROVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WITH
THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM.

   THE CONFIRMATION THAT THE AVIANCA PLANE CRASH WAS CAUSED BY A BOMB;
THE MURDER OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO URIBE, ROVING 13TH JUDGE OF CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION; AND THIS MORNING'S ATROCIOUS ATTACK ON THE DAS
FACILITIES FURTHER PROVES THAT THE DECISION MADE BY THE CHAMBER OF
REPRESENTATIVES IS HIGHLY UNSUITABLE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

   WE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT ACCEPT DRUG TRAFFICKERS TRYING TO FORCE OUR
LEGISLATORS TO ADOPT A DECISION THAT WOULD ONLY BRING MORE DESTRUCTION
AND DEATH TO COLOMBIA, BECAUSE IF THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION
ISSUE IS APPROVED IN THE REFERENDUM, IT WOULD NOT BE A DECISION MADE
BY THE SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE PEOPLE, BUT BY THE FORCE OF BULLETS AND
TERROR.

   COLOMBIANS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY PAID TOO HIGH A PRICE TO FIND OUT
WHAT THESE CRIMINALS REALLY THINK.  THEY SPOKE ABOUT A TRUCE AND THEN
THEY MURDERED A JUDGE.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES
APPROVED THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION ISSUE INTO THE REFERENDUM
AND, IN GOOD FAITH, MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD
PEACE WITH THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THEY WERE WRONG.  THE NEXT DAY THE
DAS FACILITIES WERE ATTACKED.

   THOSE ACTIONS PROVE WHAT THOSE CRIMINALS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING TO
OBTAIN A FAVORABLE DECISION IN THE REFERENDUM.  THEY DO NOT CONDUCT AN
ELECTION CAMPAIGN, BUT A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR TO ATTAIN THEIR GOALS.

   I NOW REITERATE WHAT I SAID IN MY SPEECH BEFORE LEAVING FOR JAPAN.
I SAID THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WITH THE INCLUSION OF THE
REFERENDUM IS HIGHLY UNSUITABLE.

   I SHARE THE SORROW AND SADNESS OF ALL MY COMPATRIOTS, ESPECIALLY
VICTIMS' RELATIVES.  OUR INDIGNATION MUST REPRESENT ALL COLOMBIANS'
INTENTION TO JOIN EFFORTS AND DROP PERSONAL INTERESTS.

   COMPATRIOTS, WE MUST NEVER, WE WILL NEVER SUCCUMB TO THE
NARCOTERRORISTS.  THE STABLE DEMOCRACY WE HAVE BUILT AND DEFENDED WITH
GREAT EFFORT FOR OVER 1 CENTURY IS ENDANGERED.  THROUGHOUT ITS
HISTORY, COLOMBIA HAS OVERCOME MORE DIFFICULT TIMES.  LET US ALL STAND
UP WITH FAITH, COURAGE, AND FIRMNESS TO DEFEND OUR HOMELAND AND
FREEDOM.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

TERRORISM, VIOLENCE, AND ORGANIZED CRIME.  DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH JAPANESE AND FOREIGN MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES IN TOKYO, PRESIDENT

GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND THE GRAN COLOMBIAN MERCHANT FLEET'S
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE FAR EAST.

EXPLODED WHEN TAKING OFF FROM BOGOTA, AND EXPERTS WHO CAME FROM MANY

BARCO VARGAS SAID HERE ON THURSDAY HIS GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BOW TO TERRORIST
THREATS EXEMPLIFIED BY WEDNESDAY'S BOMB EXPLOSION IN BOGOTA.

   BARCO, WHO IS ON A FOUR-DAY VISIT TO JAPAN THROUGH FRIDAY, SAID
THAT SUCH SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ARE BASED ON THE MISTAKEN BELIEF OF
TERRORISTS THAT VIOLENCE CAN TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT.

   HE SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD FIGHT OFF SUCH CHALLENGES.

   A TRUCK, PACKED WITH DYNAMITE, EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY, COLOMBIA'S
FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS POLICE, ON WEDNESDAY.

   AT LEAST 35 PEOPLE DIED AND 350 PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED IN THE BLAST,
WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN RELATED TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S
ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THE DRUG TRADE.

   COLOMBIA IS SAID TO BE THE LARGEST EXPORTER OF THE ILLICIT DRUG,
COCAINE, TO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS INTENSIFIED ITS CRACKDOWN ON THE
COCAINE SMUGGLERS SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF A LEADING PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE ON AUGUST 18.

   BARCO, SPEAKING AT THE JAPAN NATIONAL PRESS CLUB EXPRESSED CONCERN
ABOUT AN INCREASE OF COCAINE CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES AND
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND CALLED FOR WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS TO
HELP STABILIZE THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN COLOMBIA, WITH PARTICULAR
EMPHASIS ON MORE ECONOMIC SUPPORT.

   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY COLOMBIA WOULD CALL ON THE UNITED
STATES TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH ARMED FORCES, THE PRESIDENT
EMPHASIZED HE HAS NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING ANY INTERFERENCE BY FOREIGN
COUNTRIES IN HIS NATION.

   BARCO IS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE JAPAN FOR COLOMBIA FRIDAY.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 7 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ PREDICTED A SERIOUS CRISIS ON THE CONTINENT IF A SOLUTION FOR
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT IS NOT FOUND.  HE APPEALED TO "THE FOREIGN
POWERS" TO HALT THEIR INTERVENTION IN THE SUBREGION.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE BROADCAST OVER TELEVISION FOR ALL THE COUNTRY,
PEREZ TODAY PREDICTED THAT THE COMING CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE WILL FAIL IF WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS
"FOREIGN POWERS" DO NOT HALT MILITARY AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE
VARIOUS FACTIONS FIGHTING IN THE CONVULSED REGION.

   THE COSTA RICAN, NICARAGUAN, GUATEMALAN, SALVADORAN, AND HONDURAN
PRESIDENTS WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE SHORTLY TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND REACTIVATE THE ESQUIPULAS II AND TELA
PACIFICATION ACCORDS.

   "IF THE FOREIGN POWERS, BE THEY THE UNITED STATES, CUBA, THE SOVIET
UNION, OR WHATEVER, PERSIST ON DISTURBING A DIRECT ANALYSIS AND
PREVENTING A FRIENDLY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS, THIS SUMMIT WILL COME TO NOTHING," PEREZ POINTED OUT.

   PEREZ SAID THAT THE RECENT FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] OFFENSIVE IN EL SALVADOR INTERFERED SERIOUSLY WITH THE
REGIONAL PACIFICATION PROCESS.  HE REQUESTED THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT CLARIFY THE DEATH OF SIX JESUITS WHO WERE MURDERED BY THE
DEATH SQUADS.

   "THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SALVADORAN CRISIS OCCURRED AT AN
UNTIMELY MOMENT, WHEN THINGS WERE GOING SO WELL.  THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS, HOWEVER, RESTS HEAVILY WITH THE FMLN AND THOSE WHO GAVE ARMS
TO THE REBELS SO THEY COULD CARRY OUT SO MAJOR A MILITARY OPERATION,"
HE SAID.

   HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS ACCOUNTABLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SIX JESUITS, WHO WERE MURDERED IN A LOWLY AND
WICKED MANNER. THIS MUST BE CLARIFIED ALSO," HE SAID.

   THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT, WHO OFFERED TO MEDIATE IN THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT, SAID HE REPORTED TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS, THE
SUMMIT'S HOST, THE CONTENTS OF A LETTER THAT THE FMLN SENT TO PEREZ,
IN WHICH THE ORGANIZATION PROPOSES A CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL
VERIFICATION.

   PEREZ ASKED THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE
"THE FATE OF ALL OF LATIN AMERICA IS AT STAKE."

   REFERRING DIRECTLY TO THE SAN JOSE SUMMIT -- HE SAID HE WAS
INSTRUMENTAL IN CHOOSING COSTA RICA AS SITE FOR THE MEETING -- PEREZ
ASSUMED AN "OPTIMISTIC YET CONCERNED" STANCE WITH REGARD TO THE
MEETING'S RESULTS.

   HE FINALLY SAID: "THIS SAN JOSE SUMMIT WILL MAKE THINGS CONFORM TO
ESQUIPULAS II AND TELA IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE LEFT
ALONE AND PARTICULARLY IF THEY KNOW THAT NONE OF THEM WILL BE BACKED
BY ANY ONE POWER WITH ARMS OR MONEY."

INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE TO DETERMINE WHO PLACED A CAR BOMB IN FRONT OF THE
DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] FACILITIES.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS DIRECTOR, A SPANISH TERRORIST AND ETA [BASQUE
FATHERLAND AND LIBERTY] MEMBER WHO COULD HAVE ADVISED THE
COLOMBIANS ON THE PREPARATION OF THE CAR BOMB HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.

   DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF
HIS SUBORDINATES AND FELLOW WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF AN
EXPLOSION IN FRONT OF THE DAS FACILITIES.  AT THE END OF THE RELIGIOUS
CEREMONY, GEN MAZA SAID THAT HE DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT
FOREIGN TERRORISTS PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GEN MAZA] THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THIS COULD BE SO,
BECAUSE THE METHODS AND SYSTEM USED TO FABRICATE THE CAR BOMB LEAD US TO
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE EXPERTS IN THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY.  [END RECORDING]

   GEN MAZA, WITH SADNESS IN HIS EYES, ADDED THAT HE WILL CONTINUE
WORKING IN THE SAME OFFICE WHERE THE ATTACK OCCURRED.

   LIMA, 7 DEC 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [EXCERPTS] PRESIDENT ALAN
GARCIA ANNOUNCED THAT THE BORDERS WILL BE REOPENED.  HE SAID THAT THE
RESULTS OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED 15 DAYS AGO ARE POSITIVE.  THE PRESIDENT
CALLED ON ALL BUSINESSMEN AND INDUSTRIALISTS NOT TO SPECULATE ON PRICES.  HE
ALSO REITERATED HIS SUPPORT FOR ECONOMY AND FINANCE MINISTER CESAR VASQUEZ
BAZAN, WHO HE SAID IS MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO FACE THE PERUVIAN ECONOMIC
SITUATION.  GARCIA MADE THESE STATEMENTS AFTER A MEETING WITH THE COUNCIL OF
MINISTERS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] THE BORDER CLOSURE
MEASURE EXPIRES TODAY.  WILL IT BE EXTENDED?

   [GARCIA] NO, THE BORDERS WERE NEVER CLOSED.  WE ONLY ESTABLISHED
SOME RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF TRANSIT PERMITS IN TACNA TO PREVENT AN
INCREASE OF SMUGGLING BEFORE THE YEAR-END FESTIVITIES.  THE 15-DAY
TERM OF THAT MEASURE HAS EXPIRED, AND IT WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.

   [REPORTER] APPARENTLY, THAT MEASURE HAS NOT HAD GOOD RESULTS.

   [GARCIA] I THINK THAT IN GENERAL IT HAS YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS
BECAUSE SMUGGLING HAS PROBABLY DECREASED SOMEWHAT.  AS YOU KNOW, A FEW
YEARS AGO CHILE ESTABLISHED THE IQUIQUE FREE ZONE WHERE PRODUCTS ARE
SOLD TO PERU AND BOLIVIA.  THUS A STABLE MARKET OF HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHICH DAILY PASS THOROUGH THE TACNA BORDER WITH
SMALL PACKAGES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.

   WE SIMPLY RESTRICTED THE PERMITS THEY USE TO BRING IN A TAPE
RECORDER OR LASER DISC PLAYERS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT SMUGGLING DECREASED
FOR A FEW DAYS.  HOWEVER, THAT MERCHANDISE ENTERED THE COUNTRY BY
OTHER MEANS.  WE CANNOT IMPOSE TOO MANY RESTRICTIONS, BUT WE CAN ASK
THE CUSTOMS OFFICE AND THE POLICE TO INCREASE THEIR EFFORTS TO CONTROL
EXCESSIVE SMUGGLING INTO THE COUNTRY.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE FREE-MARKET DOLLAR WILL DROP BY
JANUARY?

   [GARCIA] I AM SURE IT WILL.  LAST YEAR, LIKE NOW, THE FREE- MARKET
DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE INCREASED SHARPLY BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE PAYING
YEAR-END BONUSES AND THEY ARE CONVERTING THEIR PROFITS INTO DOLLARS.
PEOPLE ARE TAKING HOLIDAY TRIPS AND BUYING MORE GOODS AND HOME
APPLIANCES.  THEREFORE, THE DOLLAR DEMAND AND PRICES HAVE INCREASED.

   LAST YEAR, WHEN THE MUC [SINGLE EXCHANGE MARKET] DOLLAR
EXCHANGE RATE WAS AT 500 INTIS TO A DOLLAR, THE FREE-MARKET DOLLAR
CLIMBED TO 2,000 INTIS.  LATER IT DROPPED TO 1,000 INTIS IN JANUARY.
I THINK THAT THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN THIS YEAR. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   [REPORTER] THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RUMORS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS THAT
THE ECONOMY MINISTER IS ABOUT TO RESIGN OR IS BEING PRESSURED TO
RESIGN.  IS THIS TRUE?

   [GARCIA] THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD PRESSURE HIM IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC, AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT PRESSURING HIM.  WE ACKNOWLEDGE
THE CURRENT DIFFICULTIES OF THE PERUVIAN ECONOMY AS WELL AS THE EFFORTS OF
THE ECONOMY MINISTER.  I EXPRESS MY RECOGNITION OF AND SUPPORT FOR THE
ECONOMY MINISTER BECAUSE HE IS YOUNG, WELL-INTENTIONED, AND VERY HONEST; HE
HAS PROGRESSIVE IDEAS.  HE IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT POSSIBLE TO STABILIZE THE
ECONOMY AS WELL AS POSSIBLE, AND HE SPONSORED A DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AFTER
THE ELECTIONS.

   [REPORTER] TODAY DID THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS DISCUSS A WAGE
INCREASE FOR THIS MONTH?

   [GARCIA] THAT POINT MUST BE DEFINED BY THE ECONOMY AND LABOR
MINISTERS.  TODAY, IN ADDITION TO THE BORDER ISSUE, WE DISCUSSED A
SUBJECT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT A FEW WEEKS AGO.

   ON THAT OCCASION I LISTENED TO A REPORT FROM THE SO-CALLED
COMMANDER HUAIHUACU.  HE IS CHIEF OF SOME 85 PEASANT COMMUNITIES ALONG
THE APURIMAC RIVER WHICH HAVE REBELLED AGAINST SHINING PATH CONTROL.
THE APURIMAC RIVER SEPARATES THE AYACUCHO AND CUSCO DEPARTMENTS, AND
THESE PEASANTS LIVE IN AN AREA CALLED OREJA DE PERRO IN LA MAR
PROVINCE.  THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT A DEMOCRATIC UPRISING AND ORGANIZED
THEMSELVES TO KEEP SHINING PATH FROM ENTERING THEIR COMMUNITIES.

   THIS SO-CALLED COMMANDER HUAIHUACU, WHO IS A MAN OF ACTION, HAS
ORGANIZED APPROXIMATELY 85 COMMUNITIES ON THE BANKS OF THE APURIMAC
RIVER, IN AYACUCHO PROVINCE OF LA MAR AND THE CUSCO DISTRICT OF
CHARATE.  HUAIHUACU HAS COME TO LIMA SEEKING SUPPORT.

   WE HAVE DECIDED WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTRY TO GO TOMORROW TO
RINCONADA BAJA AREA IN LA MAR PROVINCE, SHINING PATH'S PRIMARY AREA OF
ACTIVITY FOR 10 YEARS.  THERE I WILL DEDICATE A RADIO STATION TO BE
CALLED RADIO DEMOCRACIA. ITS AIM WILL BE TO BROADCAST NEWS AND
DEMOCRATIC AND PATRIOTIC MESSAGES FROM THAT AREA WHICH IS A CENTER OF
PEASANT RESISTANCE AGAINST TERRORISM.

   WE WILL ARRIVE THERE TOMORROW AND TALK WITH THE PEASANT LEADERS WHO
FOR YEARS HAVE FOUGHT SHINING PATH TOGETHER WITH OUR NAVY INFANTRY
UNITS STATIONED IN LUISIANA AND SAN FRANCISCO. [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END

NOT IMPLY A SURRENDER, ONLY THE CREATION OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NEGOTIATIONS
WHICH WILL ALLOW THE SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL AGREEMENT BY 15 FEBRUARY 1990.

ITS WEAPONS AND JOIN THE POLITICAL PROCESS IN EL SALVADOR BY THEN.

WILL PREVENT MORE DESTRUCTION IN CENTRAL AMERICA."

   "WE ARE LIVING A FUTILE, SENSELESS WAR IN WHICH THE CENTRAL

ANOTHER," CEREZO SAID.

   CEREZO UNDERLINED THE HOPE THAT A POLITICAL DECISION WILL EMERGE SO

WE CONDEMN GUATEMALAN INTERVENTION IN EL SALVADOR.  THE URNG GENERAL
COMMAND EXPRESSES ITS STRONG SOLIDARITY AND DEEP ADMIRATION FOR THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THEIR VANGUARD, THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], WHO WITH GREAT HEROISM AND DETERMINATION
ARE WRITING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS PAGES OF ITS HISTORY.

   WE VIEW WITH PROFOUND INDIGNATION HOW THE OFFICERS OF LA TANDONA
[REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY] AND THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT
HEADED BY CRISTIANI, IN VIEW OF THEIR INABILITY TO DEFEAT, REPEL, OR CONTAIN
THE HEROIC FMLN, HAVE DECIDED TO CONTINUE MASSIVE BOMBINGS AGAINST
DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS, SOW DEATH AND DESTRUCTION, AND COMMIT MASSACRES.

   THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH ARE
DESPERATE DUE TO THE VICTORIOUS ADVANCES OF THE FMLN FORCES -- WHICH
HAVE NOT ONLY MAINTAINED, BUT EXPANDED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR
AND THE REST OF THE TERRITORY OF THAT FRATERNAL COUNTRY -- HAVE LOST
CONTROL.

   WITH VENGEANCE IN THEIR MINDS, THEY HAVE BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT A
NUMBER OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST ALL THOSE IDENTIFIED WITH THE JUST
STRUGGLES OF THE MAJORITY.  AT DAWN ON 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS
AND TWO HUMBLE WOMEN WHO WORKED FOR THEM WERE BRUTALLY ASSASSINATED.
WE SHARE THE GREAT SORROW OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY
OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND ADD OUR PROTEST TO THOSE OF OTHERS THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD WHO HAVE ALREADY PROTESTED THESE DESPICABLE ASSASSINATIONS.

   THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS INCIDENT AND URGES
ALL GUATEMALANS AND ALL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, DEMOCRATIC, AND RELIGIOUS
ORGANIZATIONS TO SPEAK OUT IN THE FACE OF THESE GENOCIDAL AND BARBARIC
ACTIONS THAT ARE ONLY COMPARABLE TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES DID IN
VIETNAM AND THE NAZIS DID IN WORLD WAR II.

   IN OUR 13 NOVEMBER STATEMENT, WE DENOUNCED THE GUATEMALAN ARMY'S
INTERVENTIONIST PLANS AGAINST THAT FRATERNAL COUNTRY.  ON 15 NOVEMBER,
PRESS AGENCIES REPORTED THAT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY HAD DEPLOYED 126
UNITS OF THE SPECIAL KAIBILES [COUNTERINSURGENCY] TROOPS, WHO
ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR PATHOLOGICAL SAVAGERY.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE COMMANDER OF THE MILITARY STAFF, AND THE
OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMED FORCES HAVE PUBLICLY
EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH CRISTIANI AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY.  WE
CONDEMN WITH ALL OUR STRENGTH THE GUATEMALAN ARMY'S INTERVENTION AMONG
THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE CALL ON ALL SEGMENTS OF THE GUATEMALAN POPULATION TO EXPRESS
THEIR OPPOSITION AGAINST THIS INTERVENTION.  WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE
GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY FOR THEIR AGGRESSION AGAINST
THE FRATERNAL SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE ADVISE THE WORLD THAT EL SALVADOR
MIGHT FACE AN EVEN WORSE GENOCIDE THAN THE ONE IT IS CURRENTLY
ENDURING.  WE ARE SURE THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT ALL
THEIR ENEMIES, WIN THIS HISTORIC STRUGGLE, AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS.
THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED WILL BREED NEW LIFE AND WILL UNDOUBTELY
LEAD US TO FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] "JUST A FEW WORDS TO EXPLAIN THE CURRENT MILITARY
SITUATION.  WE BELIEVE THAT STILL, REGRETTABLY, FOLLOWING THE FMLN'S
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] IRRATIONALITY, WE CANNOT RULE
OUT A CONTINUATION OF THEIR VIOLENT ACTIONS.  WE KNOW THAT AROUND THE
CAPITAL THERE ARE STILL GROUPS OF TERRORISTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN
AREA, IN THE NORTHWEST -- THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO-- AND IN THE NORTHEAST,
TO THE NORTH OF SOYAPANGO MUNCIPALITY.  THE MILITARY, HOWEVER, HAVE TAKEN
THE OFFENSIVE IN THESE THREE AREAS WHERE THE FMLN GROUPS HAVE BEEN CHASED.
FIGHTING HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, WITH OVER 100 CASUALTIES
INFLICTED UPON THE FMLN IN 3 DAYS.

   "WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE LEFT WITHIN THE CAPITAL GREAT
NUMBERS OF WEAPONS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED.  SOME GROUPS
ARE IN HIDING, USING CIVILIANS, AND ARE CARRYING OUT TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES.  THEY HAVE BURNED BUSES, GASOLINE STATIONS AND MURDERED DR
FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO; AND ON 7 DECEMBER, THEY FIRED THREE OR FOUR
MORTAR ROUNDS AT RANDOM, FALLING ON PRIVATE HOMES.  ONE OF THEM FELL
ON THE HOUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT.  WE BELIEVE
THESE ACTIONS ARE JUST MERE TERRORISM, INDISCRIMINATELY FIRING MORTARS
ON THE CAPITAL'S CIVILIANS.

   "WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE NO FURTHER CAPACITY EXCEPT TO CARRY OUT THESE
TERRORIST ACTS TO CREATE CONFUSION AND ANARCHY AMONG THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.  THANK GOD, OUR POPULATION IS VERY BRAVE AND HEROIC. WE
HAVE BEEN NOTICING WITH PRIDE HOW THE POPULATION HAS BEEN WORKING
NORMALLY IN ALL OF SAN SALVADOR, GOING TO THEIR JOBS, WITH BUSINESSES
OPENING AND TRYING TO OPERATE NORMALLY.  THERE ARE STILL SOME THREATS
IN THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL, WHERE A GROUP OF TERRORISTS ARE
CONCENTRATED TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CITY.  HERE, TOO, THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEGUN AN OFFENSIVE AND QUICKLY END ANY IMMINENT DANGER."

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AT THE 10
DECEMBER PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF
RESTARTING A DIALOGUE WITH THE INSURGENTS ON 20 DECEMBER, IN CARACAS,
VENEZUELA, AS LONG AS THE FMLN NO LONGER CARRIES OUT ARMED ACTIONS IN
URBAN AREAS, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND SHOULD
CONTINUE ACTIONS ONLY AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS.

   [CRISTIANI] "AS YOU ALL HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELVES, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER BEEN AGAINST CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS TO
FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  IT HAS BEEN THE
FMLN THAT UNILATERALLY BROKE THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS BY NOT TURNING UP
AT CARACAS, VENEZULA, AS HAD BEEN AGREED IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.  WE,
HOWEVER, ARE GOING TO MAKE A DEFINITE PROPOSAL IN COSTA RICA, WHICH IN
GENERAL TERMS IS AS FOLLOWS:

   "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO RESTART THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS.  MOST CONVENIENT WOULD BE FOR THIS TO TAKE PLACE IN CARACAS,
WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITION: BEGINING 15 DECEMBER, 3 DAYS AFTER THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL MEETING [3-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION],
THE FMLN SHOULD PUBLICLY DECLARE AND GIVE PROOF OF COMPLIANCE THAT IT
WILL END ALL TYPES OF TERRORIST ACTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT CIVILIANS.  WE WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE ARE NOT
ASKING THEM TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS, AS WAS ATTEMPTED MANY TIMES.  IF
THE FMLN CONTINUES ITS IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR, THE ARMED FORCES WILL
CONTINUE FIGHTING THEM.  TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST CIVILIANS MUST END.
THE PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE TO CONTINUE BEING THE MOST AFFECTED BY THE
IRRATIONALITY OF ALL THIS FIGHTING. WE THINK THE LEAST THE FMLN CAN DO
IS TO STOP ALL ACTIONS THAT AFFECT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION.  MILITARY TARGETS ARE SOMETHING ELSE; BUT IF WE
ANALYZE THINGS, UP TO THIS MOMENT NOT A SINGLE MILITARY OBJECTIVE WAS
THE TARGET SINCE 11 NOVEMBER.  THEY HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO TAKE
OVER A CIVIL DEFENSE POST.  ALL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN AGAINST CIVILIANS,
TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THEM, TRYING TO CREATE TERROR AMONG THE
POPULATION.  THE CESSATION OF TERRORIST ACTS SHOULD BE THE FMLN'S
PROOF OF SINCERITY AND WILL TO REALLY TRY AND SEEK A SOLUTION BY WAY
OF DIALOGUE.  IF THE FMLN TODAY ACCEPTS ENDING ALL ACTIONS AGAINST THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION, THEN WE ARE WILLING ON 20 DECEMBER TO GO TO
CARACAS AND TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS AND TALKS ON ALL THE
TOPICS THE FMLN WISHES TO TALK ABOUT. THJIS WILL BE IN ORDER TO ENSURE
THAT BY 15 FEBRUARY WE HAVE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT."  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS,
ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, STATED TODAY THAT "THE UNITED STATES SAYS
THAT IT WANTS TO HELP IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL
SALVADOR. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDER OF
THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IT IS OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE."

   ARCHBISHOP RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID, "I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE PURPOSE OF
ASSUMING THIS ATTITUDE IS.  HOWEVER, WHEN EYEWITNESS LUCIA BARRERA DE
CERNA FIRST TESTIFIED, SHE CLEARLY DESCRIBED THE MEN AS BEING DRESSED
AS SOLDIERS AND NOT AS GUERRILLAS. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS EASY TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ONE WAY OF DRESSING AND ANOTHER."

   IT SEEMS THAT THE PLAN IS TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATION THROUGH OTHER
PATHS, AND THAT IS WHY THE U.S. OFFICIALS TOOK THE EYEWITNESS TO THE
UNITED STATES, "WHERE SHE WAS GIVEN AN AUTHENTIC BRAINWASHING AND
THREATENED WITH DEPORTATION IF SHE DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH."

   ACCORDING TO THE JESUITS' LAWYER, SCOTT GRATHEAD, MRS. CERNA WAS
SUBJECTED TO AN "AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT" QUESTIONING SESSION.  AFTER
THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL TORMENT, SHE THOUGHT IT OVER AND RETRACTED HER
STATEMENT.  FORTUNATELY, ONCE RID OF THE PRESSURE FROM HER
"PROTECTORS," SHE HAS RETAKEN THE PATH OF TRUTH.

   IN HIS HOMILY TODAY, THE ARCHBISHOP DENOUNCED THE UNITED STATES FOR
TREATING THE WITNESS DIFFERENTLY ONCE SHE ARRIVED IN THE UNITED
STATES, INSTEAD OF PROTECTING HER LIKE THE U.S.  EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN
SAN SALVADOR HAD PROMISED, KNOWING THAT THE HUMBLE WORKING WOMAN
"FREELY AND SINCERELY HAD DECLARED WHAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD THE
NIGHT OF THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE."  THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE MURDERED ON
THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER.

   REFERRING TO THE STATEMENT MADE BY THE NATION'S ATTORNEY GENERAL,
WHO SAID THAT THE CHURCH HAS REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS -- A LAWYER-PRIEST
HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION -- THE
ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT THIS STATEMENT IS NOT ONLY FALSE BUT ALSO
MALICIOUS.

   IN HIS HOMILY TODAY THE PRELATE SAID THAT, IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT
THE LAYMEN'S GROUND, AND THAT IS WHERE THEY SHOULD PROVE THEIR
EXPERTISE AND MORAL INTEGRITY. THEY SHOULD IMBUE THE EXERCISE OF THEIR
PROFESSION WITH EVANGELICAL VALUES.

   THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT, IN THE SECOND PLACE, "IT COULD BE A
TRAP."  HE ADDED THAT THE CHURCH IS NOT GOING TO ENDORSE WITH A
CLERGYMAN'S PRESENCE SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO BE
"MURKY."

   THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS LINKED TO THE INVESTIGATION IN AN
INDEPENDENT WAY HAVE BEEN DISTRUSTFUL EVER SINCE THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL'S OFFICE SHOWED ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD LUCIA BARRERA DE CERNA'S
TESTIMONY.  SHE WAS TESTIFYING AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY BEFORE LAWYERS
AND AMBASSADORS, AND AS THE CURFEW HOUR APPROACHED, THEY TOOK THE
WITNESS TO ANOTHER EMBASSY.  THE NEXT DAY TWO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS CAME
TO HARASS THE WITNESS WITH QUESTIONS.

   THE ARCHBISHOP ONCE AGAIN REJECTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
ACCUSATION.  HE REITERATED THE BELIEF THAT THE ARMED FORCES WERE
GUILTY OF THE MURDERS.  HE SAID, "I AM NOT MAKING ANY ACCUSATIONS.
HOWEVER, THE CHURCH IS VERY ANNOYED, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SAYING THAT
WE ARE THE OBJECT OF OFFICIAL PERSECUTION, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
THIS REGIME THERE IS PERSECUTION IN OTHER SECTORS."

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] A SPOKESMAN FOR THE
LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE [CD] SAID TODAY THAT, IF THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE GUERRILLAS RESTART TALKS ON 20 DECEMBER, THE COUNTRY'S
POLITICAL OPPOSITION WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS "SO THAT THE
PEOPLE MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ATTAINING PEACE."

   A SOURCE FROM THAT POLITICAL GROUP, WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER TWO
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTIES WITH ONE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY AND IS A
MEMBER OF SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT THESE GROUPS
"SUPPORT ALL INITIATIVES FAVORING PEACE."

   THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT "IF A DIALOGUE DOES TAKE PLACE, WE WANT
THE PEOPLE, REPRESENTED BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES, TO TAKE PART IN THIS
PROCESS THAT EL SALVADOR NEEDS MORE THAN EVER TODAY."

   THE SPOKESMAN SAID THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S
PROPOSAL ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY, IN WHICH HE EXPRESSES HIS WILLINGNESS TO
RESTART THE DIALOGUE IF THE GUERRILLAS STOP "THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS
AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION" BY 15 DECEMBER, IS "FEASIBLE AS LONG
AS THERE IS A SINCERE WILL."

   CRISTIANI'S PROPOSAL TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) WILL BE REVEALED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
DURING THEIR SIXTH SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA TODAY.  THE SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT EXPECTS TO RECEIVE HIS COLLEAGUES' POLITICAL SUPPORT.

   THE CD BELIEVES THAT CRISTIANI "DOES NOT WANT TO APPEAR
WARMONGERING OR DEFIANT IN COSTA RICA, AND WILL BRING TO SAN JOSE A
MORE MARKETABLE PROPOSAL THAT HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS."

   "THE DIALOGUE THAT HE PROPOSES IS FEASIBLE AND REASONABLE, BUT THE
PEOPLE MUST BE INVOLVED IN IT," THE SOURCE POINTED OUT.

   HE ADDED THAT THE "NEGATIVE" ASPECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL IS
THAT "IT FAILS TO MENTION THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE ARREST
AND PERSECUTION OF POLITICAL LEADERS, AND THE STATE OF SIEGE IN FORCE
SINCE 12 NOVEMBER."

   THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR HAS WORSENED SINCE 11
NOVEMBER, WHEN THE GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE IN 10
YEARS OF FIGHTING.

   CRISTIANI BELIEVES THAT IF THE FMLN SUSPENDS ITS HOSTILITIES
AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION THE DIALOGUE COULD BE RESUMED ON 20
DECEMBER IN CARACAS AND "THERE WOULD BE A SOLUTION TO THE ARMED
CONFLICT" IN THIS COUNTRY ON 20 FEBRUARY 1990.

   THE GUERRILLAS HAVE NOT YET REPLIED TO THE PROPOSAL OF CRISTIANI,
WHO GAVE ASSURANCES THAT THE REBELS ARE "NOT BEING ASKED TO LAY DOWN
THEIR ARMS."

   IN FACT, CRISTIANI NOTED THAT HE WOULD MAINTAIN HIS WILLINGNESS TO
TAKE PART IN A "DIALOGUE" EVEN IF THE GUERRILLAS ATTACK POSITIONS THAT
ARE "STRICTLY MILITARY.  OUR SOLE CONDITION IS THAT THEY SUSPEND
TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   THE WAR THAT BEGAN 10 YEARS AGO IN EL SALVADOR HAS LEFT MORE THAN
70,000 DEAD.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 10 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT]
[NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO BROCKMAN] [TEXT] I CAME
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT OUR REPORTER FRIENDS WERE GREATLY INTERESTED
IN KNOWING WHAT IS HAPPENING.  I UNDERSTAND THAT ATTITUDE BECAUSE I
WORKED AS A NEWSMAN FOR MANY YEARS.  I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOUR NEED TO
TRANSMIT INFORMATION TO OUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE SO
INTERESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' SUMMIT,
AND TO THE REST OF THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, WHO ARE INTERESTED THAT
PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TOWARD A FINAL PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   YESTERDAY EVENING, THE FOREIGN MINISTERS AGREED NOT TO SPEAK TO THE
PRESS INDIVIDUALLY.  WE APPOINTED COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO
MADRIGAL NIETO AS OUR SPOKESMAN.  HE SAID WHAT WE HAD AGREED TO SAY AT
THAT TIME.  IN FACT, THERE IS NOT MUCH MORE TO REPORT NOW.  FOREIGN
MINISTER MADRIGAL NIETO TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTERS
HAD BASICALLY DEVOTED THEIR TIME TO EXAMINING THREE TOPICS.  WE ALSO
HAD TWO MORE TOPICS, BUT IN ALL THERE WERE THREE TOPICS.  I THINK HE
MENTIONED THE CONTRAS' DEMOBILIZATION, THE INTERNAL SITUATION IN EL
SALVADOR, AND A THIRD TOPIC, BUT RIGHT NOW I DO NOT DARE TO SAY WHAT
IT WAS LEST I MAKE A MISTAKE.  [AT THIS POINT, AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON
INTERRUPTS, SAYING: "ONUCA"]

   HE MENTIONED ONUCA [UN OBSERVER GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA].
THAT IS CORRECT.  IN FACT, WE DISCUSSED FIVE TOPICS, BUT IF HE
SAID...[CHANGES THOUGHT] ONUCA WAS ONE OF THEM.  SO WE HAVE
DEMOBILIZATION, THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, AND ONUCA.  THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS DEVOTED THEIR TIME TO THESE THREE TOPICS.

   THIS WAS NOT SO EASY.  SOME SAY THE THING TO DO IS TO CLEARLY AND
CATEGORICALLY CONDEMN THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] FOR...[CHANGES THOUGHT] AND TO DESCRIBE IT AS A
TERRORIST GROUP.  OTHERS SAY: LET US CONDEMN TERRORISM IN GENERAL, AND
ALSO ANYONE WHO USES IT.  SOME ATTACH A GREAT DEAL OF IMPORTANCE TO
WHAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SPECIALIZING IN DEFENDING AND
PROMOTING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS SAY, NAMELY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, AMERICA'S WATCH, THE GENEVA-BASED INTERNATIONAL
LEAGUE OF JURISTS, THE OAS' INTER-AMERICAN COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS,
THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, THE UN'S TASK FORCE ON FORCED
DISAPPEARANCES, AND THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CATHOLIC INSTITUTE IN
LONDON, ENGLAND.  ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY FROM THE
NICARAGUAN STANDPOINT DESERVE RESPECT AND CREDIBILITY, INDICATE
MATTERS ARE NOT SIMPLY BLACK AND WHITE.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 10 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL LARIOS TODAY REJECTED THE CHRISTMAS
TRUCE PROPOSED BY SOME COUNTRIES AT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT AND
DEMANDED THAT THE GUERRILLAS END HOSTILITIES AS A PRIOR CONDITION FOR
THE DIALOGUE TO BE RESUMED.

   THE MINISTER, WHO ALWAYS LABELED THE REBELS "TERRORISTS," SAID THAT
THIS "IS NOT THE TIME FOR TRUCES, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED
THAT THEY DO NOT WORK."  COSTA RICA PROPOSED A "CHRISTMAS TRUCE" TODAY
BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND GUERRILLAS TO ALLEVIATE THE EXISTING
TENSION IN THE AREA IN THE WAKE OF THE HEIGHTENED FIGHTING IN EL
SALVADOR, WHICH HAS LEFT 2,000 DEAD IN THE PAST MONTH.

   LARIOS, HOWEVER, AGREED THAT THE DIALOGUE "CAN BEGIN" WITHOUT THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) TURNING OVER ITS
WEAPONS BEFOREHAND.  "THE GUERRILLAS DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO TURN
OVER THEIR WEAPONS FOR THE DIALOGUE TO BEGIN," LARIOS STATED.

   THE SALVADORAN GENERAL DENIED THAT THE FMLN CAN ESTABLISH ITSELF IN
CERTAIN "TERRITORIES" WHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE HELD.  "THE FMLN
TERRORISTS ARE NOT IN ANY SPECIFIC PLACE," LARIOS STATED, AND THEN
NOTED THAT THE GUERRILLAS WILL RECEIVE "GUARANTEES" FOR THEIR SAFETY
IF THEY END HOSTILITIES AND BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS "TO REJOIN POLITICAL
LIFE."

   LARIOS REJECTED THE FMLN CHARGES AGAINST RANKING MILITARY OFFICERS,
WHO IT ACCUSED OF MASTERMINDING THE KILLING OF THE SIX JESUITS, FIVE
OF WHOM WERE SPANIARDS, AND TWO WOMEN.

REPORTED THAT, FOR THE THIRD DAY IN A ROW, STRONG BATTLES ARE BEING
WAGED IN TONACATEPEQUE, APPROXIMATELY 14 KM NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE REBELS, THROUGH THEIR CLANDESTINE RADIO STATIONS, HAVE
CONFIRMED THESE REPORTS ADDING THAT THE BATTLES ARE BEING WAGED
AGAINST SALVADORAN AIR FORCE TROOPS BECAUSE THIS AREA IS CONSIDERED AN
AIR FORCE "SECURITY ZONE."

   CLASHES WERE ALSO REPORTED IN SANTIAGO AND SAN JUAN NONUALCO, LA
PAZ DEPARTMENT, 28 OR 30 KM SOUTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   MEANWHILE, IN SAN SALVADOR, LARGE AREAS OF THE CITY WERE WITHOUT

PARATROOPER BATTALION, THE SPOKEKSMAN ADDED.

   THE OFFICIAL REPORT DID NOT INDICATE ARMY CASUALTIES IN THE CLASHES
REPORTED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS.

   FROM 2300 ON 10 DECEMBER UNTIL 0200 TODAY, THE GUERRILLAS ALSO
ATTACKED CIVIL DEFENSE MILITARY POSITIONS IN TONACATEPEQUE, 16 KM
NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THEY KILLED TWO CIVIL DEFENSE MEMBERS.

   GOVERNMENT SOURCES IN TONACATEPEQUE SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS SACKED
TWO PHARMACIES AND SEVERAL STORES, WITH REGARD TO WHICH COPREFA SAID
IT HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED.

   THE ARMY'S WAR BULLETIN ADDS THAT 10 REBELS WERE KILLED IN
NEIGHBORHOODS LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN PART OF ZACATECOLUCA, IN THE
CENTRAL LA PAZ DEPARTMENT.

   A ZACATECOLUCA PEASANT WHO ARRIVED IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY SAID THAT
"THE SITUATION ON 10 DECEMBER WAS DIFFICULT, THERE WERE SHOOTOUTS
DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT," AND THAT THE AIR FORCE "ATTACKED."

   MEANWHILE, CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS, THE FMLN'S OFFICIAL VOICE,

RADIO STATION'S REPORT THAT A HONDURAN FISHING BOAT WAS ATTACKED BY A
SANDINIST ARMY HELICOPTER.

   ACCORDING TO TEGUCIGALPA'S RADIO AMERICA, THE ALLEGED INCIDENT
OCCURRED ON THE ATLANTIC, OFF BLUEFIELDS, AND REPORTEDLY LEFT AN
UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED.

   ESPINOZA SAID IN COSTA RICA, WHERE HE IS ACCOMPANYING PRESIDENT
DANIEL ORTEGA TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT, THAT "THE REPORT ON THE
ATTACK WAS RELEASED WITH THE INTENTION OF INTERFERING IN THE MEETING
OF THE REGION'S PRESIDENTS."

   THE TRUTH IS, ESPINOZA SAID, THAT LAST WEEK A HONDURAN FISHING BOAT
WAS SEIZED ON THE ATLANTIC BECAUSE IT WAS FISHING IN NICARAGUAN
WATERS, AND THE CREW SUBSEQUENTLY MUTINIED AND KILLED A SANDINIST
SOLDIER.

   THE MINISTER SAID THAT "NO INCIDENT OCCURRED TODAY."

   MANAGUA, 20 MAR 89 -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT] THE MURDER OF THREE
JOURNALISTS IN EL SALVADOR YESTERDAY ONCE AGAIN SHOWS THE REPRESSIVE AND
CRIMINAL NATURE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY.

   THOSE ACTIONS AGAINST OUR PRESS COLLEAGUES ARE ONLY COMPARABLE WITH
ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMIES IN CHILE, PARAGUAY, AND OTHER MILITARY
DICTATORSHIPS.  THE SOMOZIST ARMY COMMITTED SIMILAR CRIMES IN NICARAGUA.  WE
JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE COLD WAY IN WHICH U.S.  JOURNALIST BILL STEWART
WAS KILLED WHILE COVERING THE LAST PHASE OF THE INSURRECTION IN MANAGUA'S
WESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS.

   IN EL SALVADOR, FOREIGN AND NATIONAL JOURNALISTS ARE DEMANDING A SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION FROM PRESIDENT DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO PUNISH THE MILITARY MEN
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME.  WILL THE ARMY'S HIGH COMMAND BE WILLING TO
CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION?  WE DOUBT IT, BASED ON ITS LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO
RECTIFY THINGS IN THE PAST REGARDING OTHER CASES, SUCH AS THE ASSASSINATION
OF MSGR ROMERO AND THE MURDER OF HERBERT ANAYA, PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN
RIGHTS COMMISSION.  AFTER ALL, THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH NAPOLEON DUARTE'S
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT RESTRAINS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN HIS
COUNTRY.  MORE THAN 11 JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY
SINCE 1981.  

   MEANWHILE, IN NICARAGUA, JOURNALISTS FROM INDEPENDENT MEDIA ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT 39 FORMER SOMOZIST GUARDS WHO ARE STILL IN JAIL BECAUSE OF THEIR
CRIMINAL RECORDS, TO THE POINT OF LAUNCHING JOURNALISTIC CAMPAIGNS DEMANDING
FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE RELEASE OF THE HARMLESS PIGEONS.

   WHAT WILL THEY SAY NOW ABOUT THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH MURDERED THEIR
COLLEAGUES WHO WERE COMPLYING WITH THEIR DUTY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC?  WILL
THEY DEFEND THEM AS THEY DEFENDED THE SOMOZIST GUARDS?  THEY PROBABLY WILL.
THEY WILL TRY TO PLAY DOWN THE ACTION, BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR DIGNITY,
GOOD SENSE, AND PROFESSIONAL PRIDE A LONG TIME AGO.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 11 DEC 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH LIEUTENANT COLONEL RICARDO WHEELOCK, CHIEF OF THE NICARAGUAN
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[WHEELOCK] I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENCE HERE.  THIS MORNING WE
RECEIVED REPORTS THAT THE SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY [EPS] HAD BOMBED AND
SANK SEVERAL HONDURAN BOATS.  WE MEAN CIVILIAN FISHING BOATS.  I WILL
TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

   WE HAVE VERY FEW PATROL BOATS ON THE ATLANTIC COAST AND OUR BOATS
THERE ARE IN CHARGE OF PROTECTING NICARAGUA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND WEALTH.
FOR MANY YEARS, THE NICARAGUAN AIR FORCE AND THE SANDINIST NAVY HAVE
BEEN CONDUCTING JOINT OPERATIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT THE
FIRST TIME WE HAVE CONDUCTED SUCH OPERATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE
TAPED MOST OF THOSE OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE THOROUGH TRAINING
AND ACCURACY.

   DURING THOSE OPERATIONS, HELICOPTERS HAVE DEPLOYED MEN WHO BOARD
MOST OF THE SHIPS PARTICIPATING IN THE OPERATIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS,
HELICOPTERS FOLLOW THE SHIPS AS THEY MOVE ALONG AND THEN SPECIAL
SANDINIST NAVY FORCES BOARD THE SHIP FROM THE AIR.

   I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED MORE OR LESS.  ON 7 DECEMBER 1989 WE
CONDUCTED AN OPERATION, BASICALLY BECAUSE SINCE NOVEMBER, WE HAVE
DETECTED OVER 30 PIRATE SHIPS, IN OTHER WORDS, SHIPS THAT HAVE NEITHER
LICENSE NOR PERMIT TO FISH IN NICARAGUAN TERRITORIAL WATERS.

   DURING AN OPERATION OF THE TYPE I JUST DESCRIBED, OUR FORCES
BOARDED THREE BOATS AT 1020 ON 7 DECEMBER.  THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED
OUT APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES EAST OF PUERTO CABEZAS.  IN OTHER WORDS,
THE THREE BOATS WERE BOARDED IN THIS AREA HERE.  [WHEELOCK APPARENTLY
SHOWS LOCATION ON A MAP].

   THE NAMES OF THE BOATS ARE "KERRY MAC II", "DAVIS JR," "MISS
PATSY," AND ANOTHER ONE CALLED "TIE WATER" [NUMBER OF BOATS AS
HEARD].  THE BOATS WERE CAPTURED AND TAKEN TO ISLA DEL MAIZ.  IN EACH
BOAT THERE WERE FIVE NICARAGUAN SOLDIERS, ONE AIR FORCE OFFICER, AND
ONE NAVY OFFICER.  AS THE BOATS WERE TAKEN TO ISLA DEL MAIZ, THE
MEMBERS OF THE "MISS PATSY" CREW, WHO NUMBERED APPROXIMATELY 60,
MUTINIED AGAINST THE SANDINIST OFFICERS ON BOARD.

   THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN AND A COOK DISARMED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS AND
KILLED HIM.  AS A RESULT OF THE CONFRONTATION, THE COOK WAS KILLED,
BUT THE CAPTAIN WAS UNHARMED.  AFTER THE MUTINY WAS OVER, AND AT
APPROXIMATELY 0.7 MILES FROM CORN, I MEAN ISLA DEL MAIZ, THE SHIP'S
CAPTAIN RAN THE "MISS PATSY" FISHING BOAT AGROUND ON SOME REEF NEAR
ISLA DEL MAIZ GRANDE AND WE WERE FORCED TO, LET US SAY, SAVE ALL THE
PEOPLE ON BOARD AND TAKE THEM TO CORN ISLAND.

   ONE OF THE "MISS PATSY" SAILORS JUMPED OFF THE SHIP AND WE HAVE
BEEN UNABLE TO FIND HIM.  OF THE TWO BODIES, THAT OF THE ARMY OFFICER
AND THE COOK, WE HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER THE COOK'S BODY
BECAUSE THE SHIP SANK.  MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE TAKEN TO
HOSPITALS IN BLUEFIELDS AND OTHERS ARE BEING HELD BY THE SANDINIST
NAVY.  THAT IS MORE OR LESS WHAT HAPPENED.

   WHEN THE "MISS PATSY" RAN AGROUND, THE CREW MEMBERS OF THE OTHER
SHIPS CAME TO HELP, AND DURING THIS TIME, APPARENTLY, THE SHIP CALLED
"DAVIS JR" MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND IT, BUT WE
WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE FOLLOWING EPS OFFICERS ARE ON THAT BOAT: AIR
FORCE FIRST LIEUTENANT VICTOR RODRIGUEZ HERNANDEZ, LT JUAN CARLOS GALO
TINOCO, NAVY SAILOR JOSE MARCELINO REYES, AND SAILOR JOSE RENE
RODRIGUEZ.

   WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE "DAVIS JR," BUT WE BELIEVE IT
RETURNED TO HONDURAS.  THAT IS MORE OR LESS WHAT HAPPENED.  I AM NOW
READY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO ASK.  [CONTINUED]

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN], WITH REGARD TO THE
RESULTS OF THE EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS,
REPORTS THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTS' MEETING HAS ALLOWED US TO
MEASURE THE DEPTH OF THE CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR AND THE IMPACT OF THE
FMLN'S CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE, INASMUCH AS THE SUMMIT'S ENTIRE
EFFORT WAS AIMED AT SAVING THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FROM AN EXTREME
POLITICAL AND MILITARY CRISIS AND FROM INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION IN
EXCHANGE FOR A NEW PROMISE ON THE IMMEDIATE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS.

   2.  THE FMLN INDIGNANTLY REJECTS THE PRESIDENTS' DECLARATION
BECAUSE, CONTRARY TO THE DYNAMICS OF THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, THE CLAMOR OF DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL FORCES, AND THE CLAMOR
OF CHURCHES IN THE COUNTRY, THIS DECLARATION UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORTS
THE LEADING VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REGION, A GOVERNMENT THAT
HAS MURDERED AND PERSECUTED THE CLERGY AND BOMBED THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION. THIS SUPPORT ENCOURAGES THOSE WHO HAVE UNLEASHED THAT
IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE AND ALLOWS MORE MURDERS IN EL SALVADOR.

   3.  THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR. THE FMLN CANNOT BE DISBANDED AS THE RESULT OF
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE THE FMLN CONSTITUTES A
GENUINELY POPULAR POWER THROUGHOUT THE SALVADORAN TERRITORY, A FORCE
THAT THE HUGE U.S.-FINANCED WAR MACHINE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP IN
10 YEARS.

   4. AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID IN PRIVATE, THE FMLN AGREES WITH UN
SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ' MEDIATION TO INITIATE SERIOUS
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL OF THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL
AND SOCIAL FORCES.

   5. WE ARE HEREBY CALLING FOR INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY SO OTHER
COUNTRIES CAN MOBILIZE IMMEDIATELY TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE,
WHO ARE IN DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM AN ESCALATION IN EFFORTS TO
EXTERMINATE IT BECAUSE THE FASCIST POLICY HAS BEEN REINFORCED BY THE
SUPPORT THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' DECLARATION OFFERS TO
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR AND
REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] IN THE CASE OF EL SALVADOR,
THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF THE IRREGULAR GROUP BEING AROUND SAN SALVADOR,
IN GUASAPA, OR IN CHALATENANGO -- WHEREVER THEY MAY WANT TO OPERATE.
WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEMOBILIZATION PROCESS IS APPLICABLE IF THE GROUP
CEASES TO BE AN IRREGULAR GROUP, SOMETHING THAT NO LONGER HAS ANY
JUSTIFICATION, TO BECOME A POLITICAL OR A CIVIC GROUP IN THE FRAMEWORK
OF A LEGAL PROCESS.

   THE MESSAGE HERE IS THAT THE PRESIDENTS NO LONGER WANT OR JUSTIFY
IRREGULAR GROUPS IN THE REGION, AND IRREGULAR GROUPS HAVE NO REASON
FOR CONTINUING IN THE REGION.  THIS INCLUDES THE NICARAGUAN
RESISTANCE, THE FMLN, AND OTHER GROUPS, SUCH AS THOSE THAT MAY EXIST
IN GUATEMALA.  IF GUATEMALA WERE TO ASK THAT A PROBLEM IN THAT SISTER
COUNTRY BE CONSIDERED, WE WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER IT BECAUSE IT IS THE
SAME SITUATION.

   SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS IS
REQUESTED THROUGH AN ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS CIAV.  THE FIRST THING TO
DO IS TO CEASE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, TO INITIATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS,
AND THEN TO BE DEMOBILIZED AND TO BECOME A LEGAL GROUP THAT WOULD
FUNCTION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF SALVADORAN LAWS.

   [MODERATOR] MARIA DOLORES ARGUIAQ, FROM RADIO NACIONAL, SPAIN.

   [ARGUIAQ] CONTINUING WITH THE NICARAGUA PARALLELISM, IS THERE THE
POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A CEASE-FIRE BEFORE OR AFTER THE VENEZUELA
MEETING AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD OTHER MEASURES THAT COULD PUT AN END TO
THE WAR?  MY OTHER QUESTION IS: THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN EXPLICITLY
ASKED TO PREPARE THE REINITIATION OF THE DIALOGUE.  HAS THERE BEEN ANY
PREPARATION?  HAS THE CHURCH MADE ANY PREPARATIONS IN THIS REGARD?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, [1-MINUTE BREAK IN TRANSMISSION] THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.  AN END OF HOSTILITIES IS BASICALLY LIKE SAYING: DO
NOT CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.
IT IS BETTER TO DEFINE MEANINGS AND NOT TO USE TERMS THAT CREATE
PROBLEMS OF SEMANTICS.  WHAT IS YOUR SECOND QUESTION?

   [ARGUIAQ] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] LOGICALLY.  SOMEBODY ELSE HAS ASKED ME ALSO IF WE HAVE
HAD ANY CONTACT WITH THE FMLN.  THIS AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED AT 0400.  AT
0700 WE GOT ON A PLANE AND HERE WE ARE NOW.  WE HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO
SPEAK WITH MR PEREZ DE CUELLAR, MUCH LESS WITH THE FMLN.  BUT THIS
INFORMATION WILL BE PASSED TO THE UNITED NATIONS BECAUSE THERE IS MUCH
TO BE ASKED OF THE UNITED NATIONS.  WE HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH THE
PLEASANT SURPRISE THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UN OBSERVER GROUP IN
CENTRAL AMERICA [ONUCA] ARE ALREADY IN THE COUNTRY, TO BE INSTALLED.

   MR ORTEGA, WHO HAD GONE THERE WITH THE POSITION THAT AS LONG AS THE
RESISTANCE IS NOT DEMOBILIZED HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT ONUCA, HAD TO
ABANDON THAT POSITION BECAUSE IT WAS IRRATIONAL, AND ONUCA WILL BE
ASKED TO GO TO NICARAGUA IMMEDIATELY.

   THE AGREEMENT WILL BE REPORTED TO MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR.  HE
WILL ALSO RECEIVE FROM EL SALVADOR A REQUEST THAT HE WORK IN FAVOR OF
REINITIATING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  THE AGREEMENT HAS SPECIAL
CONTENTS.  IT DOES NOT MENTION OTHER COUNTRIES BY NAME BECAUSE THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE TRIED TO PRODUCE A DOCUMENT THAT IS
VERY RESPECTFUL OF COUNTRIES FROM OUTSIDE THIS AREA, BUT IT IS
UNDENIABLE THAT THERE ARE STATES THAT ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE
SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE UN SECRETARY
GENERAL, ESPECIALLY AND PERSONALLY, ARE BEING ASKED TO HELP MAKE
STATES THAT MEDDLE IN THE REGION SEE THAT THEY MUST HELP THE PEACE
PROCESS PROMOTED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.

   OBVIOUSLY I DO NOT HAVE TO MENTION THE NAMES OF THE COUNTRIES TO
WHICH I AM REFERRING.

   IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A REAL
SOLUTION, TO SEE THAT ALL THE FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN EXERTING
INFLUENCE, WHETHER NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, WORK IN A POSITIVE WAY.  THE
UNITED NATIONS, WHICH COMPRISES ALL THESE STATES, IS IN A BETTER
POSITION TO CARRY OUT THIS WORK.  


DEV-MUC3-0973 (SRI)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] ON RETURNING TODAY
FROM THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT HELD IN COSTA RICA, SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THE TERRORIST ACTIONS OF THE
GUERRILLAS ARE NO LONGER JUSTIFIED FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW."

   PLEASED WITH THE POLITICAL SUPPORT HE OBTAINED FROM HIS COLLEAGUES
INCLUDING NICARAGUA'S DANIEL ORTEGA, CRISTIANI SAID IN A NEWS
CONFERENCE THAT HE WILL IMMEDIATELY RESUME THE DIALOGUE WITH THE
GUERRILLAS "AS SOON AS THE GUERRILLAS CEASE HOSTILITIES AND PUBLICLY
GIVE UP COMMITTING VIOLENT ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT "IN THE SUMMIT THERE WAS A
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN THAT THE PRESIDENTS CALLED THE GUERRILLAS BY
THEIR NAMES."

   CRISTIANI FEELS THAT THE "TERRORIST ACTIONS" OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ARE NOT JUSTIFIED, AND THAT THE
GUERRILLAS "ARE PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT THAT IS ONLY CAPABLE
OF GENERATING TERRORISM."  IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE,
THE GUERRILLAS COULD NOT SURVIVE, HE ADDED.

   BEFORE CRISTIANI HAD FINISHED HIS NEWS CONFERENCE, THE FMLN
"ANGRILY" REACTED WHEN IT LEARNED OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE
PRESIDENTS IN COSTA RICA WHO ASKED FOR THEIR "DEMOBILIZATION."

   THE PRESIDENTS ALSO ASKED THE FMLN TO "PUBLICLY GIVE UP COMMITTING
VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION," AND TO "REJOIN THE DIALOGUE PROCESS" THAT WAS SUSPENDED 2
MONTHS AGO.

   THE GUERRILLAS ACCUSE THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT OF BEING
"THE MAIN VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS" AND STATED THAT THE COSTA RICA
AGREEMENT "ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES THOSE WHO HAVE UNLEASHED THIS
IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE AND IT ALLOWS FOR AN EVEN GREATER SLAUGHTER IN EL
SALVADOR."

   POLICE SOURCES CONSULTED BY ACAN - EFE AGREED THAT THE UNITED
NATIONS SHOULD NOW ASSUME A "GREATER RESPONSIBILITY" AND SEEK A
SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED CONFLICT THAT HAS LEFT OVER 70,000
DEAD IN 10 YEARS OF WAR IN THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.


DEV-MUC3-0974 (SRI)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [NEWS
CONFERENCE WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED
MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CRISTIANI, IN PROGRESS] ... HE
[ORTEGA] WAS FACING A FACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO
IS SPREADING ARMED REVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IN THE REGION.  ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT
HONORING THE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE
COMMITMENTS.  ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLE
DEFENSE.

   THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPT
THE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELF
TOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.
THIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES IN
POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS.  HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT ACCEPT THE
REALITY.  HE COULD NO LONGER DEFEND THE POSITION THAT THE NICARAGUAN
RESISTANCE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WAS SOMETHING ELSE AND WAS JUSTIFIABLE.  IT
IS NOW CLEAR THAT HE HAS RUN OUT OF TRICKS AND HAS HAD TO ACCEPT WHAT
ALL THE REMAINING FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE AWARE OF AND
DEFENDED AT THE COSTA RICAN SUMMIT.  NOW, IF IN THEIR STRATEGY THEY
SOLD OUT THE FMLN, AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE, THEY WILL HAVE TO GIVE
SOME EXPLANATIONS TO THEIR FMLN FRIENDS.  THAT IS A PROBLEM BETWEEN
HIM AND THE FMLN.

   WHAT SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO US IS THAT THE FMLN'S VIOLENT AND
TERRORIST ACTIONS ARE NO LONGER JUSTIFIED FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW.
THIS HAS BEEN CLEARLY AND STRONGLY EMPHASIZED IN THE COSTA RICAN
AGREEMENT.  IN THIS REGARD, I REPEAT THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS
WILLING TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE PROCESS FROM WHICH THE FMLN
UNILATERALLY WITHDREW.  HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE
FMLN TO OPENLY PROMISE -- AND THIS IS STRONGLY DEMANDED BY THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, INCLUDING THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT -- IT WILL
CEASE TERRORIST ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AFFECTING CIVILIANS.
OBVIOUSLY A TOTAL DEMOBILIZATION AND RETURN TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
-- WITH THE GUARANTEES THAT MUST BE GIVEN TO THE FMLN MEMBERS -- WILL
BE THE RESULT OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  THIS IS HOW WE UNDERSTAND AND
VIEW THIS MATTER.  THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE
SHALL BE THE RESULT OF A CONVINCING EFFORT BY THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT, WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY GUARANTEES.  IN THE
SAME DOCUMENT, THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS UNILATERALLY VOWED TO
ENSURE THOSE GUARANTEES.

   IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
ASKED THE UNITED NATIONS TO ALSO JOIN THE CIAV [INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF
SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION], SO THE CIAV BEGINS AND IMPLEMENTS THE PROCESS TO
DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN. THIS IS BASICALLY THE DESIRE OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS.  IF THE FMLN WANTS TO GAIN POLITICAL ADVANTAGES, IT SHOULD
PURSUE THIS WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BECAUSE IT CAN NO LONGER BE
JUSTIFIED AND HAS NEVER BEEN JUSTIFIED.  HOWEVER, TODAY WE STRONGLY TELL THE
FMLN THAT NO LONGER IS THERE ANY ROOM IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND ESPECIALLY IN
EL SALVADOR, FOR VIOLENT AND TERRORIST ACTIONS.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR
AND REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, AS I SAID BEFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE
DEMOBILIZATION PROCESS BEING DISCUSSED FOR ANY REBEL ORGANIZATION
SHOULD BE A COMPLETE PROCESS WITH THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS.  IT IS A PROCESS THAT IS ADAPTED TO FIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AN
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION IS IN CHARGE OF VERIFYING THIS PROCESS. WE
BELIEVE THE ORGANIZATION HAS THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY TO DO IT, AND IT
SHOULD NOT BE A MATTER OF LOOKING FOR OTHER OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY DO
NOT EXIST.  WE HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES THE ONES THAT HAVE
ALREADY BEEN DESIGNED FOR BOTH THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE AND FOR THE
FMLN, SPECIFICALLY.  IN GENERAL TERMS THESE OPTIONS COULD BE APPLIED
TO ANY REBEL GROUP IN THE REGION.

   [MODERATOR] LUIS FUENTES FROM PRENSA GRAFICA.  [PAUSE] CARLOS
ERNESTO RUGAMA FROM RADIO CADENA YSU.

   [RUGAMA] [WORDS INDISTINCT] ...DIPLOMATIC AND TRADE RELATIONS WITH
NICARAGUA.  HOW CAN THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE RELATIONS BE ACHIEVED?

   [CRISTIANI] POINT 12 OF THIS DECLARATION MAKES A FRATERNAL CALL TO
EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA TO SEEK THE NORMALIZATION OF THE DIPLOMATIC
AND CONSULAR RELATIONS THROUGH DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATIONS.  WE MADE THE
DECISION TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA BECAUSE
OF THE FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS.  THEY WERE
DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE FMLN'S TERRORIST AGGRESSION.  IN COSTA RICA WE
GAVE THEM A DOCUMENT THAT CLEARLY DEFINES EL SALVADOR'S POSITION
REGARDING POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH COULD NORMALLY REESTABLISH THE
DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR RELATIONS.  THIS DOCUMENT WAS NOT DISCUSSED BY
THE FIVE PRESIDENTS BECAUSE IT ONLY CONCERNED TWO OF US.  HOWEVER, THE
DOCUMENT WAS GIVEN TO THE NICARAGUAN DELEGATION AND WE WILL WAIT FOR
THE RESULTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT IN GENERAL TERMS IT COULD STOP
NICARAGUA'S INTERFERENCE AND ITS SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN.

   [MODERATOR] MARIA CORTINA FROM NOTIMEX.

    CORTINA WORDS INDISTINCT ...TO IMMEDIATELY INITIATE THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS.  IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE TO PUBLICLY STOP CONDUCTING ACTIONS
AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THAT WAS PART OF THE PROPOSAL YOU
MADE HERE ON SATURDAY.  HOWEVER, I AM NOT YET CLEAR ON SOMETHING.  TO
INITIATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, DOES THE FMLN HAVE TO DECLARE A
CEASE-FIRE OR WOULD A PUBLIC DECLARATION BE ENOUGH?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION WE STATED ON 10 DECEMBER.  WE
BELIEVE THAT POINT 3 OF THIS DECLARATION UPHOLDS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ALL
ALONG REGARDING THE SEARCH FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION IN THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WANT THE FMLN TO PUBLICLY STATE
THAT THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND ALL THE VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT
ENOUGH TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT.  THEY MUST KEEP THEIR WORD.  WE BELIEVE
THAT THERE SHOULD AT LEAST BE A 5-DAY PERIOD BETWEEN THE PUBLIC STATEMENT
AND THE BEGINNING OF A DIALOGUE.  WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION, THAT IS THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND MYSELF, THAT NO HOSTILE ACTIONS BY THE FMLN
ARE JUSTIFIABLE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN SHOULD STOP CARRYING OUT ALL
HOSTILE ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY.  THIS INDICATES TWO THINGS WHICH MUST BE
UNDERSTOOD.  FIRST, THE FMLN ARE THE ONLY ONES CONDUCTING HOSTILE ACTIONS.
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS THAT BELONG TO IT DO NOT
GENERATE HOSTILITIES.  THEY SIMPLY RESPOND TO THE ACTIONS OF ARMED GROUPS
THAT ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING TROUBLE AND OVERTHROWING A LEGITIMATE
GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A LEGITIMATE
DEFENSE AND TO THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY IN FAVOR OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AS THE CONSTITUTION STATES.  SECONDLY, THE FMLN HAS LOST
ALL MANEUVERING OPTIONS.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAID IT CLEARLY
WHEN THEY STATED THAT THE FMLN HAD NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR VIOLENT
ACTIONS IN EL SALVADOR.  THAT IS WHY WE ARE ONCE AGAIN ASKING FOR AN
IMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE.  THESE WERE THE SAME WORDS USED AT THE
SUMMIT HELD IN TELA, HONDURAS.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, WE WILL MAINTAIN THE
POSITION WE HAD BEFORE, EVEN THOUGH WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH THIS DOCUMENT.

   BOGOTA, 12 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A COLOMBIAN OFFICIAL FROM THE
INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK [IDB] AND A PROSECUTOR FROM THE
MEDELLIN HIGHER COURT WERE ASSASSINATED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS NEAR
THIS NORTHWESTERN CITY, THE SECOND LARGEST IN COLOMBIA, POLICE
SPOKESMEN HAVE REPORTED.

   EDGAR HENAO, 55, CIVIL ENGINEER, ECONOMIST, AND TOP EXECUTIVE FROM
THE INTERNATIONAL CREDIT ORGANIZATION, WAS SHOT SEVERAL TIMES BY SOME
UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE AT HIS FARM CALLED EL LIMON, VENECIA MUNICIPALITY,
61 KM SOUTHWEST OF MEDELLIN.

   HENAO, WHO HAS BEEN WORKING FOR THE IDB FOR 13 YEARS, HAD ARRIVED
IN COLOMBIA ON 7 DECEMBER AND WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE FOR JAMAICA, THE
SOURCES ADDED.

   MOREOVER, 4TH PROSECUTOR GABRIEL JAIME VELEZ WAS ATTACKED IN
ENVIGADO, 10 KM FROM MEDELLIN, BY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO FIRED 13 SHOTS
KILLING HIM INSTANTLY AS HE WAS WALKING HOME.

   VELEZ, 38, WHO WAS HANDLING SEVERAL KIDNAPPING AND DRUG TRAFFICKING
CASES, HAD BEING THREATENED, BUT HE HAD NO BODYGUARDS, RELATIVES OF
THE VICTIM SAID.

   DURING THE LAST 6 MONTHS, FIVE JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES HAVE BEEN
KILLED BY HIRED ASSASSINS IN MEDELLIN.

   ALSO TODAY IN BUENAVENTURA, THE MAJOR COLOMBIAN PORT ON THE PACIFIC
COAST, JUDGE SOFIA DE ROLDAN WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY HIRED ASSASSINS.
SHE WAS PREPARING FOR A NEW JOB IN CALI, IN WESTERN COLOMBIA.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 12 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS REPORTED THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS
BOMBING THE AREA SURROUNDING A VOLCANO NEAR THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL
TONIGHT, "THREATENING THE LIVES AND SECURITY OF SALVADORANS."

   IN A RADIO AND TELEVISION ADDRESS TO NICARAGUANS TO EXPLAIN THE
SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED ON 12 DECEMBER IN COSTA RICA -- WHERE
THE SIXTH CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT WAS HELD -- ORTEGA POINTED OUT THAT
THESE BOMBINGS "ARE AGAINST THE AGREEMENTS" WHICH WERE RECENTLY
SIGNED.

   "THE BOMBS THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS LAUNCHING DO NOT HELP AT ALL IN
COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS WE SIGNED ON 12 DECEMBER IN COSTA RICA,"
PRESIDENT ORTEGA, WHO SPOKE CALMLY, WARNED.  ORTEGA APPEALED TO THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO CEASE THE BOMBINGS.

   THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT INSISTED ON THE "GREAT RESPONSIBILITY" OF
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN THE FULFILLMENT OF THE AGREEMENTS, PARTICULARLY
WITH REGARD TO THE POINTS THAT DEAL WITH THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE
"CONTRAS" STATIONED IN HONDURAS.

   ORTEGA RECALLED THAT THE UNITED STATES FINANCES THE "CONTRAS" AND
THEREFORE WASHINGTON HAS IN ITS HANDS [THE POSSIBILITY] OF
"GIVING SOME TRANQUILITY TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE."

   "THIS IS NOW A DEMAND OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLES, WHICH WAS
RATIFIED AT THE (COSTA RICA) MEETING," ORTEGA ADDED.

   ORTEGA RECALLED THAT THE DEADLINE TO DEMOBILIZE THE REBELS ENDED ON
5 DECEMBER AND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE WAS TO OPPOSE THE
DISBANDING OF THE "CONTRAS."

   ORTEGA STATED: "THUS, I BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS AND STOP DISRESPECTING THE RESOLVE
OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND PEOPLES WHO WANT PEACE."

   ORTEGA TRUSTS THAT WITH THE UN SUPPORT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
WILL MAKE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY
12,000 CONTRAS STATIONED IN HONDURAS, AS WELL AS THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TO SEEK A
SOLUTION TO AN OVER 10-YEAR-LONG WAR.

   ORTEGA ADMITTED THAT HE GETS WORRIED EVERY TIME HE ATTENDS A
SUMMIT, BECAUSE THESE MEETINGS "ARE HELD UNDER U.S. PRESSURE," BUT
FINALLY "WE REACHED AGREEMENTS THAT STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS."

   ACCORDING TO ORTEGA, THE PEACE PLANS SIGNED BY THE AREA PRESIDENTS
"HAVE HAD A GOOD EFFECT IN NICARAGUA," BUT HE WARNED THAT HE COULD NOT
SAY THE SAME FOR EL SALVADOR, "WITH WHICH WE CANNOT BE PLEASED YET."

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR
AND REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] AND AGAIN, BECAUSE THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS DID NOT WANT TO STATE THESE COUNTRIES BY
NAME, I WILL REFRAIN MYSELF FROM DOING IT AT THIS TIME, BUT THEY ARE
VERY OBVIOUS, WHO AND WHAT THEY [WORD INDISTINCT].

   BUT I THINK OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER IF THE FMLN WOULD ACT
RATIONALLY AND ACCEPT THAT THEY HAVE NO LONGER ANY RECOGNITION FOR
WHAT THEY DO, AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED, AND NOT ONLY AS AN
IRREGULAR FORCE OR GROUP.  THEY HAVE NOW BEEN CONDEMNED AS BEING A
TERRORIST GROUP, WHICH IS THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE THIRD POINT IN THE
AGREEMENT.  THEREFORE, MAYBE THEY SHOULD START THINKING ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.  MAYBE THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE, WHOSE ANNIVERSARY WE
CELEBRATE TODAY, AND WHO IS THE GUARDIAN OF ALL THE AMERICAN
COUNTRIES, WILL SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THESE IRRATIONAL PEOPLE.  THEY
MIGHT SEE THIS AS A VERY CLEAR SIGN THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER JUSTIFY OR
LIE, OR TRY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT WHAT THEY DO IS GOOD.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] THAT IS NOT WHAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS ARE LOOKING FOR.  THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION
TO THE PROBLEM AND ALL THEIR EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED IN THAT WAY.

   [MODERATOR] ANA ARANDA FROM THE MIAMI HERALD.

   [ARANDA, IN ENGLISH] [WORDS INDISTINCT] IF THE GOVERNMENT AT ANY
POINT CONFRONTED NICARAGUA OR [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHETHER THE
GOVERNMENT AS SUCH WAS TRULY INVOLVED IN SENDING WEAPONS TO THE FMLN?

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, HE WAS WATCHING SOME OF THE
VIDEOTAPES THAT I TOOK.  WE WERE WATCHING THEM WITH THE OTHER CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  AFTER A FEW MINUTES, HE SAID HE HAD SOME
TELEPHONE CALLS TO MAKE AND HE GOT UP AND LEFT.  OBVIOUSLY HE COULD
NOT JUSTIFY WHAT HE WAS SEEING AND WHAT THE OTHER PRESIDENTS WERE
WITNESSING THERE ON THE TV SCREEN.

   THERE WAS SOME CONFRONTATION WITH ORTEGA OBVIOUSLY, BUT I WILL, YOU
KNOW, WILL SAY THAT I DID NOT MIND WHERE THE WAREHOUSE WAS OR WHERE
THEY COME FROM.  IT IS SIMPLY THE FACT THAT THEY WERE AT SOME POINT IN
TIME IN NICARAGUA AND NICARAGUA WAS SENDING THEM OVER TO EL SALVADOR.
WHETHER THEY CAME FROM THE SOVIET UNION OR WHETHER THEY BOUGHT THEM
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE, OR WHEREVER THEY CAME FROM, IT REALLY MAKES NO
DIFFERENCE.  WITHIN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN, THE PROBLEM IS
THAT THEY ARE COMING THROUGH NICARAGUA WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE
NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, AND THAT IS A VIOLATION OF THE AGREEMENT.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WHAT COULD HE SAY?  NO, HE CAME OUT TRYING
TO PRODUCE SOME SORT OF DUST OVER THE ISSUE -- LIKE WE CALL IT HERE --
THROUGH HIS MINISTER OF FOREIGN RELATIONS.  HE WAS ACCUSING COSTA RICA
OF SENDING AID TO THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE.  AND MAYBE HE THOUGHT TO
DIVERT THE ATTENTION FROM THE SALVADORAN CASE BY TRYING TO SAY THAT
COSTA RICA WAS SENDING WEAPONS TO THE
 NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE.  THEN OBVIOUSLY HE ACCUSED EVERYBODY OF
SENDING WEAPONS TO NICARAGUA.

   THE POINT IS, FIRST OF ALL, HE DID NOT CONVINCE ANY OF THE OTHER
FOUR PRESIDENTS.  THAT IS FOR SURE.  AND THERE WERE NO ARGUMENTS HE
MADE IN FRONT OF THE PRESS OR AT ANY POINT IN TIME WHERE THEY DENIED
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HELPING THE FMLN.  I MEAN, IT IS VERY CLEAR AND
OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAVE HELPED THE FMLN NOT SINCE NOVEMBER 11.  ALL THE
WEAPONS THAT WERE ALREADY HERE BY NOVEMBER 11 ALSO CAME THROUGH
NICARAGUA.

   [MODERATOR] RICARDO CLEMENS FROM VISNEWS.

   [CLEMENS, IN SPANISH] [WORDS INDISTINCT] CASE OF JENNIFER CASOLO
THERE WAS A SERIES OF LEGISLATIVE ISSUES THAT ARE NOT VERY CLEAR AND
THERE IS SOME KIND OF IMPASSE REGARDING HER TRIAL.  WILL THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH HELP TO ACCELERATE THE TRIAL, OR WILL IT ISSUE SOME KIND OF
PARDON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] NO, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH CANNOT INTERFERE
WITH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS OF ANY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY.  IT WOULD HAVE
TO BE THE SUPREME COURT OR THE JUDICIARY THAT DEALS WITH THE PROBLEM.
THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THE LAW IS AND WHAT THE APPLICATION OF THE
LAW SHOULD BE.  OUR POSITION IS THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE APPLIED
IMPARTIALLY, AND EVERYTHING THAT THE JUDGE OR ANYBODY ELSE DOES IN THE
STATE SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK.

   BUT WE HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF INTERVENING IN THE JUDICIARY PROCESS.
THERE IS A SEPARATION OF POWERS BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND THE
JUDICIAL BRANCH.

   [MODERATOR, IN SPANISH] THANK YOU, MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU,
GENTLEMEN.  THANK YOU ALL.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES TODAY DENIED CHARGES BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA THAT
THE AIR FORCE "LAST NIGHT BOMBED AREAS NEAR SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO,
ENDANGERING THE LIVES AND SECURITY" OF CIVIIANS.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE SAID: "IT IS
FALSE. WE ARE NOT BOMBING."

   HE EXPLAINED THAT "SOME EXPLOSIONS" HEARD LAST NIGHT ON THE SLOPES
OF THE VOLCANO WERE FLARES FIRED "TO POINT OUT" TO ARMY UNITS ON LAND
"AREAS WHERE GUERILLA COLUMNS WERE MOVING."

   HE SAID: "THE FLARES WERE LAUNCHED FROM HELICOPTERS, AND AT NO TIME
DID WE BOMB POPULATED AREAS."

   ACCORDING TO THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE
"BOMBINGS CONTRADICT THE AGREEMENTS WE SIGNED YESTERDAY (12 DECEMBER)
IN COSTA RICA," IN WHICH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ASKED THE
FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TO END

   BOGOTA, 12 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] BRITISH ENGINEER JOHN MARCK JONES
[NAME AS RECEIVED], KIDNAPPED BY THE MARXIST-LENINIST NATIONAL
LIBERATION ARMY [ELN], RESIDES IN COLOMBIA AND BOTH HIS WIFE AND TWO
CHILDREN ARE COLOMBIANS, IT WAS OFICIALLY REPORTED TODAY.

   JONES, 45, WHO WAS REPORTED MISSING IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT IN
COLOMBIA'S NORTHEAST EARLY ON 11 DECEMBER, IS THE OWNER OF ALTA
TENSION DE COLOMBIA, A POWER COMPANY.

   JONES' RELATIVES TOLD THE LOCAL PRESS THAT, DESPITE THE INITIAL
REPORTS, THE BRITISH ENGINEER DOES NOT WORK FOR A MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATION.

   IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE ELN MISTOOK HIM FOR THE EMPLOYEE OF SOME
FOREIGN COMPANY AND THAT THEY MIGHT BE PLANNING TO DEMAND A RANSOM.

   JONES WAS TAKEN IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA OF THE CATATUMBO OIL BASIN,
NEAR THE BORDER WITH VENEZUELA, WHILE DRIVING WITH TWO FELLOW WORKERS,
WHO WERE NOT DETAINED.

   THESE MEN TOLD THE COLOMBIAN POLICE THAT THE KIDNAPPERS IDENTIFIED
THEMSELVES AS ELN MEMBERS AND THAT THEY TOOK THE ENGINEER WHEN THEY
CONFIRMED HE WAS A FOREIGNER.

   JONES' POWER COMPANY BUILDS POWER SUBSTATIONS IN OIL CAMPS IN THE
AREA WHERE HE WAS KIDNAPPED.

   A POLICE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT A SPECIALIZED AGENCY, WHICH IS
INVESTIGATING THE KIDNAPPING, IS TRYING TO DETERMINE THE ENGINEER'S
WHEREABOUTS.

   THE ELN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF KIDNAPPINGS AND EXTORTION AGAINST OIL
GROUPS, BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEMBERS, AND ENGINEERS.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 13 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH]
[NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT] ....I WAS IN SAN JOSE,
COSTA RICA AT A MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  THIS MEETING
WAS OF URGENT NATURE TO DISCUSS ISSUES SUCH AS EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA,
THE CONTRAS' DEMOBILIZATION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS.

   AT THIS MEETING, WE HELD IN-DEPTH DISCUSSIONS OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE
BEING EXPERIENCED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE
SITUATION BEING EXPERIENCED IN NEIGHBORING EL SALVADOR, WHICH IS
FACING AN INTERNAL CONFLICT -- MORE THAN A DECADE OF CONTINUED WAR AND
INTERNAL CONFLICT.  EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO A VERY STRONG
CONFRONTATION, WHICH LATELY HAS WORSENED.  AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION, THE CLERGY, NUNS, AND UNION AND LABOR LEADERS
HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THIS TRAGIC SITUATION.  AT THIS MEETING,
NICARAGUA STATED ITS POSITION THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR MUST
BE RESOLVED THROUGH NEGOTIATION AND NOT BY WAY OF VIOLENCE.  THIS
POSITION FULLY COINCIDES WITH THE POSITION THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS DEFENDED.  ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS
THE FMLN HAS MADE PEACE PROPOSALS AND IT HAS CALLED FOR NEGOTIATED
SOLUTIONS TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND FOR REAL NEGOTIATIONS.

   FOLLOWING A LENGTHY AND INTENSE DISCUSSION OF THE SALVADORAN ISSUE,
WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT, NOT ONLY WITH REGARD TO GENERAL PLEASE AND
STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN THE NEIGHBORING CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRY, BUT ON VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT COULD LEAD TO
SOLUTION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  THUS, IN POINT THREE, THE FIVE
PRESIDENTS DECIDED TO REQUEST THAT THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL MAKE A
VERY SPECIAL PERSONAL EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TOWARD THE
TALKS' SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT.

   NICARAGUA HAS THUS SUPPORTED THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION THE FMLN HAS
VIGOROUSLY AND CONSISTENTLY CALLED FOR, AND WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
HEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ALSO CLAIMS TO AGREE.  SUCH NEGOTIATION
WOULD LEAD TO A DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT WOULD RESULTE IN SOLVING THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  LIKEWISE, WE UNDERSCORED HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL
AMERICA, BECAUSE THESE RIGHTS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY VIOLATED IN CERTAIN
COUNTRIES.  THIS HAS BEEN CLEARLY STATED AT INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS.  I AM ESPECIALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, WHERE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS WERE RECENTLY
MURDERED, AND WHERE THE ARMY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF EXERTING
INDISCRIMINATE REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE, THROUGH AERIAL AS WELL
AS ARTILLERY AND INFANTRY ATTACKS.

   THIS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE IS WORRISOME TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PEOPLE, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND ESPECIALLY TO NICARAGUA.  WE
ALSO REACHED AN AGREEMENT BY WHICH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
INSISTED ON THE NEED FOR RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS RATIFIED
THEIR PLEDGES TO FULLY RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE CIVILIAN,
POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL RIGHTS ESTABLISHED IN THEIR
RESPECTIVE CONSTITUTIONS, AND IN SIGNED AND RATIFIED INTERNATIONAL
AGREEMENTS.

   NICARAGUA'S POSITION HAS NOT WAVERED; IT HAS MAINTAINED ITS
POSITIONS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES ARE WILLING TO HAVE
RECOGNIZED INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT]
IN OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, AND HELP DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL
AMERICA.  THERE ARE FORCES, CENTRAL AMERICAN ARMIES ESPECIALLY, AMONG
THEM THE SALVADORAN ARMY -- WHICH HAS ORGANIZED DEATH SQUADS THAT
SYSTEMATICALLY MURDER SALVADORAN PEOPLE -- WHOSE GOVERNMENTS AND
PRESIDENTS ARE FACED WITH CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IN OVERCOMING THE
PROBLEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  THIS, I BELIEVE, IS WHERE THE
GREATEST STRENGTH MUST BE EXERTED AND THE GREATEST EFFORT MADE TO
DISBAND THE DEATH SQUADS SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS CAN BE RESPECTED, A
PEACEFUL SOLUTION CAN BE FOUND FOR ALL THE CONFLICTS IN THESE
COUNTRIES, AND A WORSENING OF VIOLENCE CAN BE AVOIDED, ESPECIALLY
SINCE THIS VIOLENCE IS ON THE INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE INJUSTICE THAT
PREVAILS IN THESE COUNTRIES DUE TO A LACK OF EQUITY, FREEDOM, AND
JUSTICE, WHICH IS AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.  [CONTINUED]

   GUATEMALA CITY, 13 DEC 89 (RADIO NUEVO MUNDO) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT VINICIO
CEREZO HAS REFERRED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT
REPRESENTATIVES AND MEMBERS OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY,
URNG, CLEARLY STATING THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE WITH THAT
ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN DISCUSSED.  HE ADDED THAT THE URNG MUST FIRST STATE
THAT IT IS WILLING TO PEACEFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE DIALOGUE.

   THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT ADDED THAT THE REBELS MUST UNDERSTAND THA
THEY CANNOT TALK ABOUT DIALOGUE WHEN PERPETRATING ACTS OF TREASON
AGAINST THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE, MEANING PLACING BOMBS AND
PERPETRATING ACTS OF TERRORISM.  THE URNG MUST DECIDE TO SUSPEND ITS
TERRORIST ACTIONS IF IT WANTS TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, HE SAID.  CEREZO
ADDED THAT THERE IS A POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL THE IDEOLOGIES IN
GUATEMALA.

   CEREZO AREVALO ADDED THAT IF THE URNG MEMBERS WISH TO HOLD A
DIALOGUE, THEY MAY DO SO.  IN FACT, HE SAID, IF THEY WANT TO RETURN TO
THE COUNTRY WE CAN DISCUSS THE SECURITY CONDITIONS -- BUT THEY MUST
PUBLICLY STATE THEIR DECISION TO RETURN IN PEACE.  OTHERWISE, THE
PRESIDENT ADDED, IT WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO GIVING
 THE OTHER, RIGHT-WING, TERRORISTS, WHO ATTACK STUDENTS, ENGAGE IN       
KIDNAPPING, AND PLACE BOMBS, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERNAL     
DIALOGUE.  THE URNG MUST DECIDE IF IT WANTS TO JOIN US.  THEY MUST DO
IT PEACEFULLY BECAUSE THAT IS THE PROPER THING. THE PEOPLE ARE FED UP
WITH VIOLENCE AND WAR, HE SAID.

   PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO REFERRED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PARLIAMENT'S FUTURE DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE, HELD AT THE GUATEMALAN
AIR FORCE'S INSTALLATIONS UPON HIS RETURN TO THE COUNTRY FROM COSTA
RICA.  HE SAID THAT THE SAN ISIDRO DECLARATION SIGNED BY THE FIVE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS INCLUDED TWO IMPRESSIVE DECISIONS.  HE
SAID THAT THEY SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT
-- EACH COUNTRY MAY DECIDE ON ITS CONTRIBUTION AS IT SEES FIT -- A
SUBJECT WHICH HAD DELAYED THE SIGNATURE OF THE APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTS.
IN ADDITION, THE ECOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION WILL BEGIN TO
OPERATE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT ITS EFFORTS WILL HELP CONSOLIDATE
PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN THE AREA.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 13 DEC 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN RICARDO MONTENEGRO, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN "RADIO VENCEREMOS INTERNATIONAL SERVICE," BY
JORGE LUIS BERNARD] [TEXT] [BERNARD] MONTENEGRO, WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
IF THE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] WILL
CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER
SINCE THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WAS SIGNED?

   [MONTENEGRO] THE TRUTH IS THAT THE REASONS WHY THE FMLN BEGAN ITS
OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER 1989 HAVE NOT CHANGED AT ALL.  THUS, THE FMLN
CANNOT STOP ITS OFFENSIVE.  ON THE CONTRARY, WHAT HAPPENED IN EL
SALVADOR IS THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE STRATEGICALLY TURNED THE WAR.
THAT TURN INCLUDED A NUMBER OF MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND DIPLOMATIC
IMPLICATIONS.

   THUS, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN SAN ISIDRO DE
CORONADO DID NOT PROPOSE REALISTIC NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE CONFLICT.
YESTERDAY, 12 DECEMBER, THE FMLN ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE WHICH VEHEMENTLY
EXPRESSED ITS ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF THE AGREEMENT SIGNED AT THE
PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.  AT PRESENT, THE FMLN BELIEVES THAT DESPITE WHAT
THE OTHER FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAY, IT IS CLEARER THAN
EVER THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A FASCIST, MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT VIOLATES PEOPLE'S HUMAN
RIGHTS AND THAT FACT HAS BEEN CLEARLY PROVED TO THE ENTIRE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THEREFORE, ANY ATTEMPT TO HELP THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OR ANY KIND OF SUPPORT GIVEN TO IT NOTHING BUT A
PIECE OF PAPER THAT DOES NOT HAVE TOO MUCH VALIDITY TO THE FMLN.

   [BERNARD] IN OTHER WORDS COMRADE, THE FMLN WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME
LEVEL OF CONFRONTATION WITH THE DICTATORSHIP?

   [MONTENEGRO] I BELIEVE THE FMLN'S ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOW MORE
LEGITIMATE THAN EVER.  THE SUMMIT CONFIRMED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE
FMLN'S STRUGGLE, BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT RESULTING FROM THAT SUMMIT IS
NEITHER FEASIBLE NOR REAL.  THE FMLN WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE ITS
POLITICAL - MILITARY OFFENSIVE.  THE FMLN WILL INCREASE ITS ACTIONS.
THE FMLN IS REORGANIZING [READECUAR] ITS POLITICAL - MILITARY
APPARATUS.  IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE WILL CLEARLY SHOW WHAT THE FMLN
CAN DO.  THE FMLN WILL NOT SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS, ESPECIALLY NOW.  THE
FMLN HAS NO OBLIGATION TO ABIDE BY AN AGREEMENT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT
THE SALVADORAN REALITY AT ALL.

   IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CHOSE TO CLOSE THEIR EYES TO
WHAT IS GOING ON THAT IS REALLY THEIR PROBLEM.

   [BERNARD] TWO DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT,
WHAT IS THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR?

   [MONTENEGRO] AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER IN ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION,
THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE FMLN DEFINATELY CHANGED THE WAR.  THIS
MEANS THAT THE FMLN MADE THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES RETREAT FROM THE
MOUNTAINS TO THE HEART OF THE CITIES INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   AT PRESENT, WE HAVE ALMOST ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER THE HIGHWAYS IN
14, I MEAN 12 SALVADORAN DEPARTMENTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN ACTIONS IN
AHUACHAPAN AND SONSONATE, TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT HAD BEEN ALMOST
UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR.

   THERE IS A STRATEGIC SIEGE IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMY HAS 65
PERCENT OF ITS FORCES STATIONED IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMY HAS
ABANDONED LARGE AREAS.

   AS FOR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS, AT PRESENT THERE ARE 10 110,000-VOLT
PRIMARY LINES THAT ARE OUT OF SERVICE.  THAT REPRESENTS A 40-PERCENT
ENERGY DEFICIT IN THE COUNTRY.  THERE HAVE BEEN LONG PERIODS OF
100-PERCENT POWER OUTAGES IN SAN SALVADOR.  IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT
THE GOVERNMENT CAN CONTROL THAT SITUATION.  WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG
THEY WILL ENDURE IT.  BUT IN ANY CASE, A STRONG BLOW BY THE FMLN
FORCES IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR SOMEWHERE IN EL SALVADOR AT ANY TIME.

   CLANDESTINE, 13 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] WE COULD SAY THAT TO A GREAT EXTENT THE DECLARATION IS FULL OF
PRETTY WORDS, SIMILAR TO THOSE CRISTIANI USES, IN THE PARTS WHERE THE
DECLARATION CALLS ON THE FMLN TO JOIN THE ALLEGED DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND
SAYS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS LEGITIMATE.  HOWEVER, IF WE LOOK
CAREFULLY, WE CAN SEE WHAT IS BEHIND THE WORDS AND THAT IN ADDITION TO
DECLARING SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT, AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DO THE
SALVADORAN ARMY A FAVOR.  THIS IS DONE BY ASKING THE FMLN TO STOP ALL
VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   WE KNOW THAT THIS IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT REFERS TO SIEGES ON CITIES,
TO TRANSPORTATION STRIKES, AND TO SABOTAGE, THE ARMY'S MOST SERIOUS
SOURCES OF CONCERN.  UNDERNEATH THIS DECLARATION IS A REQUEST FOR THE
FMLN TO LEAVE THE CITIES BECAUSE THE ARMY CAN NO LONGER STAND THE
SITUATION AND FEELS IT IS NEAR COLLAPSE.

   THE DECLARATION DOES NOT STATE ANY CONCERN FOR BOMBINGS BECAUSE
CONSIDERING THE CONDITION IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW, ANY
STATEMENT IN THIS REGARD WOULD BE LIKE ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE.  THE
DECLARATION IS LIKE A WALKING STICK TO KEEP THE DICTATORSHIP UP, AND,
AS THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND HAS STATED IN A COMMUNIQUE, IT IS EVIDENCE
OF THE POLITICAL AND MILITARY CRISIS IN WHICH THIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN
PLACED AS A RESULT OF THE OFFENSIVE CARRIED OUT BY ALL OF YOU.

   TO CONCLUDE: LET US WAIT AND SEE IF THIS DECLARATION WILL SAVE
CRISTIANI FROM INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION WHAT THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS STATED IN ITS COMMUNIQUE,
THAT THE AGREEMENTS BY GOVERNMENTS THAT DO NOT KNOW THE TRUE SITUATION
IN OUR COUNTRY AND THAT SERVE OTHER INTERESTS CANNOT DEMOBILIZE THE
FMLN BECAUSE THE FMLN ENJOYS POPULAR SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE NATION.

   THE FMLN IS NOT LIKE THE CONTRAS WHO ARE IN HONDURAS AND
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CAN GO TO THEIR CAMPS TO DEMOBILIZE THEM.
IN EL SALVADOR THE SITUATION IS VERY DIFFERENT.  CRISTIANI HIMSELF WAS
UNABLE TO ANSWER A JOURNALIST WHO ASKED HIM IF HE WAS GOING TO
DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN IN SAN SALVADOR, IN GUAZAPA, IN CHALATENANGO, AND
MORAZAN.

   THE COSTA RICA DECLARATION IS NEITHER REALISTIC NOR VIABLE.  THIS
IS SOMETHING THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS ALREADY POINTING OUT.
AN INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION NETWORK HAS SAID THAT FOLLOWING THIS
DECLARATION, THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT COULD BECOME JUST WORDS.  A
JOURNALIST HAS ASKED HOW MUCH THIS ALLEGED INTERNATIONAL VICTORY OF
CRISTIANI IS GOING TO LAST.

   MEANWHILE, THE ARCHBISHOP OF GUATEMALA HAS SAID THAT HE DOES NOT
EXPECT ANYTHING GOOD FROM THE MEETING BECAUSE NEITHER THE CONTRAS NOR
THE FMLN WERE PRESENT.

   THE REACTION TO THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT ARE ALONG
THESE LINES.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT TRUE FACTS ARE WHAT COUNTS.  WORDS AND PAPER ARE
ALWAYS DEFEATED BY FACTS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ARMY KEEPS BOMBING
AND THAT GENOCIDE WILL ALWAYS BE CONDEMNED.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT YOUR EFFORTS, COMRADES, WILL NOT CEASE UNTIL THE
DICTATORSHIP IS DEFINITELY DEFEATED.

WOMEN.

   THE PREVIOUS STATEMENT WAS MADE ON 12 DECEMBER BY COLONEL ORLANDO
INOCENTE MONTANO DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE DEFENSE MINISTRY TO
THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS.

   THE WITNESS OF THE MASSACRE, LUCIA BARRERA DE CERNA, WAS TAKEN TO
THE UNITED STATES WHERE SHE UNDERWENT INTERROGATIONS BY THE FEDERAL

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS VERY INTERESTED IN THE THOROUGH

   ACCORDING TO A WASHINGTON DATELINE ITEM TRANSMITTED ON 11 DECEMBER

GEORGE BUSH WILL GO TO VIOLENCE-TORN COLOMBIA ON FEBRUARY 15 FOR A
FOUR-NATION SUMMIT ON ILLEGAL DRUGS, THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED TODAY.

   WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN MARLIN FITZWATER SAID BUSH WILL MEET IN
CARTAGENA, A PORT CITY ABOUT 640 KILOMETERS NORTH OF BOGOTA, WITH
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ
ZAMORA AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA.

   FITZWATER SAID BUSH IS GOING TO SHOW HIS SUPPORT FOR BARCO, WHO HAS
WAGED A NATION-WIDE WAR AGAINST DRUG LORDS SINCE LAST AUGUST.

   COLOMBIAN COCAINE LORDS HAVE SET OFF MORE THAN 260 BOMBS, KILLING
AT LEAST 190 PEOPLE, IN RETALIATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S CRACKDOWN.

   A U.S. ADVANCE TEAM, HEADED BY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE BERNARD
ARONSON, HAS BEEN SENT TO COLOMBIA TO COMPLETE PLANS FOR THE SUMMIT.

HAS BRANDED FOREIGN JOURNALISTS AS INTRUDERS.  THE HEAD OF STATE WAS CLEARLY
UPSET BY THE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS AND OBSERVERS WHEN HE
WENT TO VOTE.

   JOURNALIST ELIANA HENRIQUEZ WILL NOW GIVE US MORE DETAILS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HENRIQUEZ] GOOD AFTERNOON.  PRESIDENT AUGUSTO
PINOCHET THIS MORNING LEFT THE HIGHER INSTITUTE OF COMMERCE WHERE HE
WENT TO VOTE, ANGRY WITH CHILEANS AND CLEARLY UPSET BY THE PRESENCE OF
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND JOURNALISTS.  THE HEAD OF STATE WALKED
FROM THE LA MONEDA PALACE TO THE HIGHER INSTITUTE OF COMMERCE, WHICH
IS AT THE INTERSECTION OF AMUNATEGUI AND MONEDA STREETS.  HE WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY THE INTERIOR MINISTER, THE MINISTER SECRETARY GENERAL
OF GOVERNMENT, THE PRESIDENTIAL GENERAL SECRETARY, AND THE CHIEF OF
THE MILITARY HOUSEHOLD.  HE GREETED GENERAL CARLOS PARERA, THE
MILITARY COMMANDER OF THE METROPOLITAN REGION, AND THE SANTIAGO MAYOR.
PINOCHET THEN WENT TO VOTING TABLE NO 1 WHERE HE WAS SCHEDULED TO
VOTE.  HE SAW DOZENS OF FOREIGN TELEVISION CAMERAMEN, PHOTOGRAPHERS,
AND JOURNALISTS.

   BEFORE ENTERING THE VOTING BOOTH, PINOCHET SAID HE WAS IN VERY GOOD
SPIRITS AND VERY HAPPY.

   AFTER VOTING, PINOCHET SAID HE WAS VERY SATISFIED BECAUSE THIS
MEANT THE END OF THE MISSION HE BEGAN ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973.  HE ADDED
THAT HE EXPECTED THE ELECTION TO DEVELOP AS CALMLY AS USUAL.  WHEN A
U.S. NEWSWOMAN APPROACHED HIM FOR AN INTERVIEW, PINOCHET, IRRITATED,
ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS DOING PUTTING HER NOSE IN HERE; HE TOLD HER
THAT THIS IS OUR PROBLEM, NOT YOURS, INTRUDERS.  PINOCHET THEN TURNED
TO THE LOCAL NEWSMEN AND TOLD THEM THAT HE IS UNHAPPY WITH CHILEANS
FOR ALLOWING FOREIGN OBSERVERS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY.

   [PINOCHET] I AM UNHAPPY WITH CHILEANS BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR
FEELING OF NATIONALITY BY ACCEPTING THE PRESENCE OF A BUNCH OF
OUTSIDERS WHO HAVE COME TO LOOK OVER WHAT WE ARE DOING.  WHAT DO THEY
THINK THEY ARE DOING?  LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE: THESE OUTSIDERS
ARE HERE TO CHECK ON THE WAY IN WHICH THEIR MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED BY
THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THESE GENTLEMEN [A REFERENCE TO OPPOSITION
CANDIDATES IN GENERAL].

   [HENRIQUEZ] AS HE WAS LEAVING THE VOTING SITE, PINOCHET TOLD A
URUGUAYAN CORRESPONDENT THAT THE OBSERVERS ARE INTRUDERS.

   INTERIOR MINISTER CARLOS CACERES AFFIRMED THAT THE SITUATION AROUND
THE COUNTRY REMAINS NORMAL AND ORDERLY.  HE ADDED THAT THE ONLY
INCIDENT WAS THE BOMB EXPLOSION AT THE EL SALVADORAN EMBASSY AND A
MINOR INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING IN THE LOCALITY OF MARIA
PINTO.  CACERES SAID THAT HE WILL REMAIN ALL DAY AT THE LA MONEDA
PALACE IN ORDER TO BRIEF PRESIDENT PINOCHET ON THE VOTING PROCEEDINGS
AND ANY SECURITY PROBLEM THAT MIGHT ARISE.

   FINALLY, HE SAID THAT THE HEAD OF STATE WILL ALSO STAY IN HIS
OFFICE.  THIS AFTERNOON PINOCHET WILL PROBABLY VISIT THE VOTE COUNTING
CENTER OF THE INTERIOR MINISTRY ON MONATEGUI STREET.  GOOD AFTERNOON.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN RULING
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) PARTY TODAY SAID IT REGRETS
THE DECISION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)
TO REJECT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN
COSTA RICA.

   ARENA PRESIDENT ARMANDO CALDERON SOL DESCRIBED THE FMLN'S RESPONSE
TO THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENTS AS "LAST-DITCH EFFORTS."

   CALDERON SAID THAT "THE FMLN CANNOT FIND A WAY TO USE THE POLITICAL
OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT."

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT REJECTED THE COSTA RICAN
AGREEMENTS WITH "INDIGNATION."  IN THE AGREEMENTS, THE PRESIDENTS
REQUEST THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN AND EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.

   CALDERON SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT "WAS CONDEMNED AND FOR
THAT REASON IT HAS NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO CRITICIZE THE SUMMIT."
CALDERON SOL ADDED THAT "THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS COULD ONLY
EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRACY."

   CALDERON SAID: "FOREIGN DEMOCRACIES MUST HELP THE SALVADORAN
DEMOCRACY."

   THE SALVADORAN POLITICIAN SAID THAT IT IS "NOT TRUE THAT THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT VIOLATES CIVILIANS' HUMAN RIGHTS," AS THE
GUERRILLA MOVEMENT CLAIMS.

   THE FMLN STATES THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN AGREEMENTS
"UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORT THE LEADING VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE
REGION, A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS MURDERED AND PERSECUTED THE CLERGY AND
BOMBED THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   CALDERON SOL REPLIED THAT "THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT'S STATEMENTS ARE
ANACHRONISTIC AND INTEND TO DISCREDIT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT."

   SANTIAGO, 15 DEC 89 (TELEVISION NACIONAL DE CHILE NETWORK) --
[COMMUNIQUE] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A MAJOR
PORTION OF THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTIONS HELD TODAY.  AFTER 93 PERCENT
OF THE VOTING STATIONS HAVE BEEN COUNTED, AND WHEN ALL THAT IS NEEDED
IS THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE ELECTORAL COURT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SAY
THAT PATRICIO AYLWIN AZOCAR HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
FOR THE L990-L994 TERM.

   WITH REGARD TO THAT RESULT THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO
CONVEY TO THE PEOPLE THE FOLLOWING:

   1. ALL CHILEANS SHOULD BE PROUD FOR ONCE AGAIN PARTICIPATING IN AN
EXEMPLARY ELECTION.

   2. ON BEHALF OF THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY A
DESERVED RECOGNITION TO THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS, WHO HAVE LED
AN ELECTORAL PROCESS IN ORDER AND TRANQUILITY, AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO PARTICIPATED TODAY AT THE VOTING STATIONS. THEY ENABLED THIS
ELECTION TO BE HELD IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF PEACE, AND THEREBY ALLOWED
THE FREE EXPRESSION OF CIVIC WILL.  WE MUST, HOWEVER, REPUDIATE THE
VIOLENT MURDER OF A MEMBER OF CARABINEROS.

   3. THE PEOPLE MUST REST ASSURED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT
PINOCHET, FAITHFUL TO THE COMMITMENT MADE WITH THE ARMED FORCES AND
POLICE, WILL HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE RECENT ELECTIONS RESPECTED.  THE
GOVERNMENT CALLS ON THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER, AND
TO WAIT WITH TRANQUILITY THE FINAL RESULTS OF THIS ELECTION.

   4. DURING THE LAST 16 YEARS CHILE HAS MOVED AHEAD SYSTEMATICALLY
AND WITHOUT HESITATION TOWARD THE GREAT OBJECTIVES SET FORTH AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT IS FULLY
SATISFIED WITH THE WORK OF DEMOCRATIC, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL
RECONSTRUCTION THAT WAS CARRIED OUT BY ALL CHILEANS UNDER THE
LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT PINOCHET.  WE HAVE SET FORTH A SOLID BASIS FOR
FUTURE PROSPERITY.

   5. THIS ELECTION FULFILLED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS
FOR REACHING THE FULL DEMOCRACY THAT WAS DESTROYED IN THE PAST BY THE
ENEMIES OF FREEDOM AND PLURALISM.  AS HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT
PINOCHET SAID, 11 SEPTEMBER L973 NOT ONLY REPRESENTED THE OVERTHROW OF
AN ILLEGIMATE AND FAILED GOVERNMENT, BUT IT ALSO REPRESENTED THE END
OF A WORN OUT POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REGIME, AND THE NEED TO
BUILD A NEW ONE.  IT WAS NOT JUST A TASK OF SIMPLE RESTORATION, BUT
PRIMARILY A CREATIVE TASK WHICH, IN ORDER TO SUCCEED, HAD TO BE
CARRIED OUT IN THE DEEP ROOTS OF NATIONAL TRADITION.

   6. THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS FULFILLED THE COMMITMENT MADE
IN SEPTEMBER L973.  THE MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED.  AUTHENTIC
DEMOCRACY AS A WAY OF LIFE AND A FORM OF GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CREATED,
AND THE TRANSITION PROCESS ENDS ON 11 MARCH L990.  FROM NOW ON IT WILL
BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY CHILEAN TO KEEP WATCH SO THAT THE
STABILITY AND PROGRESS ACHIEVED WITH POLITICAL WILL AND CONSTANT
EFFORT WILL CONTINUE TO PREVAIL IN OUR FREE SOCIETY. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. GOOD NIGHT.

   CLANDESTINE, 14 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE
INVESTIGATION, THE SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOPRIC LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE ISSUES
THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT REGARDING THE MASSACRE OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS:

   THE OPERATION CARRIED OUT TO MURDER THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE
TWO MAIDS LASTED LONGER THAN 1 HOUR.  DURING ALL THAT TIME, THE
PERPETRARORS FIRED THEIR WEAPONS AND DETONATED EXPLOSIVES.  THIS WAS
PROVED BY THE FINDING OF MANY SHELL CASINGS NEAR THE JESUITS'
RESIDENCE.  THE WITNESS' STATEMENTS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE WEAPONS
WERE FIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.  THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO
COMMITTED THE CRIME WAS LARGE.  THEY WERE WEARING ARMY UNIFORMS.  THE
WITNESS SAW APPROXIMATELY FIVE INDIVIDUALS WEARING ARMY UNIFORMS. THE
WITNESS SAW THE MEN.  SHE ALSO HEARD THE SHOOTING, THE CLOSING OF
DOORS, AND THE BREAKING OF GLASS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE FACILITIES.
THE WITNESS SAID THAT FIVE INDIVIDUALS ENTERED THE SERVANTS' ENTRANCE
OF THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE.  OTHER INDIVIDUALS ENTERED THE RESIDENCE BY
THE DOOR LOCATED IN THE NORTHWESTERN END OF THE BUILDING, WHICH IS THE
AREA WHERE THE PRIESTS HAVE THEIR ROOMS.  ANOTHER GROUP ENTERED THE
JESUIT CENTER, SEARCHED IT, AND BURNED IT WITH SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS
SUCH AS FLAMETHROWERS.

   3.  [NO NUMBERS 1 AND 2 AS HEARD] THE SALVADORAN MILITARY
INTELLIGENCE, THE PERPETRATORS, KNEW THE JESUIT CENTER AND THE JESUIT
RESIDENCE.  IN OTHER WORDS, THEY KNEW THE UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY] FACILITIES.  ON MONDAY, 13 NOVEMBER, INDIVIDUALS WEARING
ARMY UNIFORMS SPECIFICALLY SEARCHED THE JESUIT CENTER AND RESIDENCE.

   4.  THE SCENE OF THE CRIME IS LOCATED INSIDE AN ARMY CONTROL AND
SECURITY AREA SINCE THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF IS LOCATED
IN THAT SAME GENERAL AREA.  THE ARMY MAINTAINS PERMANENT MILITARY
SURVEILLANCE POSTS AT THE DEMOCRACIA BUILDING, THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE
MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD, THE NORTHERN UCA ENTRANCE, AT THE VARIOUS UCA
SCHOOLS, AND AT LA CEIBA DE GUADALUPE AND JARDINES DE GUADALUPE
NEIGHBORHOODS.  ALL THOSE AREAS ARE WELL GUARDED BY SOLDIERS.

   5.  DESPITE THE EVIDENT AND VERIFIABLE MILITARIZATION OF THE AREA
WHERE THE CRIME TOOK PLACE, THE CURFEW, THE EXTENDED AND HEAVY FIRING
INSIDE THE UCA PREMISES, THE DETONATION OF EXPLOSIVES FOR AN EXTENDED
PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH THE PERPETRATORS REMAINED INSIDE THE
JESUIT FACILITIES -- WHICH GAVE THE PERPETRATORS TIME TO SEARCH THE
JESUIT PRIESTS' ROOMS, KILL THEM ALONG WITH THE OTHER TWO VICTIMS, AND
SEARCH AND BURN THE JESUIT CENTER CHURCH, THUS PROVING THE SIZE OF THE
OPERATION -- THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT REACT AS THEY WOULD HAVE IF THIS
OPERATION HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT].  THIS INDICATES THAT THE SOLDIERS IN CHARGE OF
SECURITY IN THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE ARMED
FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF INSTALLATIONS WERE AWARE OF THE OPERATION
THAT WAS BEING CARRIED
 OUT.

   THEREFORE, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE CONCLUDES
THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL OF THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THE SIX
JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE TWO MAIDS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 DEC 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT HAS NOT PROPOSED TO THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT RESUMING DIPLOMATIC
AND CONSULAR RELATIONS, PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI EXPLAINED ON 13 DECEMBER
AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.

   "I HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT UNILATERALLY NORMALIZING RELATIONS, NOR
ARE WE THINKING OF DOING THIS UNLESS THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT
COMPLIES WITH CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PRESENTED IN A DOCUMENT IN
SAN JOSE," THE PRESIDENT SAID.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE HOSTED ON 12 DECEMBER, HE SAID THAT THE
PRESIDENTS OF GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, AND COSTA RICA HAD URGED SOME TYPE
OF DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS WITH ORTEGA TO SEEK NORMALIZING RELATIONS
WITH NICARAGUA, AND AS A RESULT HE PRESENTED THE DOCUMENTS WITH THE
REQUIREMENTS.

   UNTIL THE AFTERNOON OF 13 DECEMBER, THE NICARAGUAN REGIME HAD NOT
ANSWERED THE MINIMUM CONDITIONS FOR EL SALVADOR TO REESTABLISH OR
NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH MANAGUA.

   EL SALVADOR SUSPENDED ALL TYPES OF RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA ON 26
NOVEMBER, AFTER THE SALVADORAN ARMY DISCOVERED A PLANE COMING FROM
MANAGUA WITH WEAPONS FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN].

   CRISTIANI HAS INSISTED THAT "WITHOUT THE MATERIAL SUPPORT THAT THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT GIVES THE TERRORISTS OPERATING HERE, THEY WOULD
NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LAUNCH THE UNSUCCESSFUL OFFENSIVE OF 11 NOVEMBER
IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER IMPORTANT CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

   THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, HE SHOWED ORTEGA A
GREAT DEAL OF EVIDENCE OF THE NICARAGUAN INTERVENTION IN SALVADORAN
AFFAIRS.

   HE ALSO SHOWED ALL THE PRESIDENTS A VIDEO IN WHICH MEMBERS OF THE
FMLN ARE SHOWN RECEIVING TRAINING IN NICARAGUA, AND IN WHICH FMLN
LEADERS SUCH AS JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL AND OTHERS ARE SHOWN RECEIVING
INSTRUCTIONS IN MANAGUA, AND OTHER EVIDENCE.  AFTER VIEWING SEVERAL
MINUTES OF SUCH EVIDENCE, ORTEGA GOT UP AND TOLD THE PRESIDENTS HE WAS
GOING TO MAKE A TELEPHONE CALL, BUT HE NEVER RETURNED TO THE ROOM,
CRISTIANI SAID.  "IN OTHER WORDS, ORTEGA WAS NEVER ABLE TO DENY HE IS
SENDING WEAPONS AND HELP TO THE FMLN," THE PRESIDENT POINTED OUT.

PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS CALLED ON THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO RESPECT THE
PEACE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  AT A MEETING
WITH RESIDENTS OF NIQUINOMO, ORTEGA TALKED ABOUT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY
THE PRESIDENTS OF THE REGION DURING THE MEETING IN SAN ISIDRO DE CORONADO,
COSTA RICA.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ORTEGA] THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN COSTA RICA ARE
ANOTHER STEP FOWARD IN THE INTEREST OF PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT COMPLETELY SATISFIED, BECAUSE, AS I WAS TELLING
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS YESTERDAY, IT IS ONE THING TO AGREE ON
SOMETHING AND SIGN AN AGREEMENT, BUT WHAT WE DO WHEN WE RETURN TO OUR
COUNTRIES IS QUITE ANOTHER.  THERE MUST BE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN WHAT IS
SIGNED AND WHAT IS DONE.  IF WE SIGN AN AGREEMENT AND PROMISE TO
RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, THEN WE MUST RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS - - NOT KILL
PRIESTS AND BRUTALLY REPRESS THE PEOPLE AS IN EL SALVADOR.  IF WE
AGREE THAT THE CONTRAS MUST BE DEMOBILIZED, THEN THE HONDURAN
GOVERNMENT MUST DO ITS PART TO ENSURE THAT THE CONTRAS ARE
DEMOBILIZED.  WE MUST DEMAND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE
AGREEMENTS.  THE PROBLEM WE FACE IS THAT AFTER EVERY PRESIDENTIAL
SUMMIT IS HELD AND AGREEMENTS ARE SIGNED, THE YANKEE GOVERNMENT DOES
NOT RESPECT THEM AND CONTINUES TO DO AS IT PLEASES.  I HOPE THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT WILL, ONCE AND FOR ALL, RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  THE UNITED STATES CAN SHOW ITS
WILLINGNESS TO RESPECT THESE AGREEMENTS BY REFRAINING FROM HINDERING
THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TRULY
WILLING TO RESPECT THESE AGREEMENTS, THEN IT MUST NO LONGER GIVE THE
CONTRAS MONEY TO MURDER THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE. LIKE THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAID, THAT MONEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION.  ONLY IN THIS
WAY WILL THE CONTRAS STOP BEING A THREAT TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 15 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT [M-19] HAS ASKED VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ FOR
POLITICAL SUPPORT TO SECURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BETWEEN
THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO.

   EVERTH BUSTAMANTE, THE M-19'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS SECRETARY,
SAID TODAY IN CARACAS THAT ON 14 DECEMBER HE INFORMED PEREZ ABOUT THE
GRAVE POLITICAL CRISIS WHICH HAD EXPLODED IN HIS COUNTRY IN RECENT
DAYS.

   THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENTS OF COLOMBIA'S TWO LARGEST
POLITICAL PARTIES, AS WELL AS THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS' POSITION IN
FAVOR OF SUBMITTING TO A REFERENDUM THE RULING ON EXTRADITING DRUG
TRAFFICKING SUSPECTS, IN DEFIANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION, HAS
CREATED A POLITICAL VACUUM IN THE COUNTRY AND, BUSTAMANTE SAID, THE
GOVERNMENT NO LONGER HAS A MONOPOLY OF POWER.  THIS SITUATION, HE
ADDED, CREATES DOUBTS ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN
NOVEMBER 1988 [AS RECEIVED] BY THE M-19 AND THE GOVERNMENT.  IN LINE
WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE REBELS WOULD SURRENDER THEIR WEAPONS.

   IN RECENT MONTHS THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HAS MET ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE
M-19 AND HAS PROPOSED THAT THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL RECEIVE THE
ARMS OF THIS GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION WHICH WANTS TO JOIN COLOMBIA'S
POLITICAL LIFE.

   BUSTAMANTE SAID THAT THE SITUATION THAT HAS EMERGED HAS IMPOSED A
DELAY IN THE SURRENDERING THE WEAPONS WHICH HAD BEEN SCHEDULED FOR 19
DECEMBER.  HE DID NOT GIVE A NEW DATE FOR THIS ACTION, BUT HE DID NOT
DISCARD EITHER THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD BE IN JANUARY OF NEXT
YEAR.

   AN ACUTE POLITICAL CONFRONTATION EXPLODED IN COLOMBIA WHEN THE
COLOMBIA CONGRESS DECIDED, AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT'S WILL, TO SUBMIT TO
A REFERENDUM THE PRACTICE OF EXTRADITING DRUG TRAFFICKING SUSPECTS TO
THE UNITED STATES SO THAT THEY MAY BE TRIED THERE.

   BUSTAMANTE NOTED: THIS MAKES IT EVIDENT THAT MANY LEGISLATORS
SUPPORT THE DEMANDS OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  BUSTAMANTE ADMITTED,
HOWEVER, THAT THESE EXTRADITIONS VIOLATE COLOMBIA'S CONSTITUTION.

   ACCORDING TO THE M-19 LEADER, "THE ONLY WAY" OF OVERCOMING THE
CURRENT POLITICAL CRISIS IS TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED TO
TAKE PLACE NEXT YEAR AND TO CONVOKE A CONSTITUENT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
AND A REFERENDUM TO DECIDE ON CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.

   THESE TWO POINTS FORM PART OF THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN NOVEMBER 1988
[AS RECEIVED] BY THE M-19 AND THE GOVERNMENT.

   BUSTAMANTE, WHO LEAVES TOMORROW FOR MEXICO CITY AND LONDON, CALLED
ON THE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS TO SURRENDER THEIR WEAPONS IF THE
GOVERNMENT CONVOKES A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 15 DEC 89 (TCS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] YESTERDAY, MARIA JULIA
HERNANADEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE ARCHBISHOPRIC LEGAL ASSITANCE OFFICE, MADE
OFFICIAL STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE UCA
[CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] PRIESTS.

   IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST ISSUED BY THE SALVADORAN 4TH CRIMINAL
COURT, MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ MADE STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT
REGARDING THE MURDER OF SIX UCA JESUIT PRIESTS.  THE PRIESTS WERE
KILLED ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   ACCORDING TO HERNANDEZ, HER STATEMENT WAS PERSONAL AND SHE LIMITED
HERSELF TO REPORTING ON THE INVESTIGATIONS SHE CONDUCTED AT UCA AFTER
THE MURDER.  IN HER STATEMENT, HERNANDEZ SAID THAT SHE FOUND FOUR
BULLET CASINGS INSIDE UCA.  THE PROSECUTORS THEN ALLEGED THAT SHE HAD
COMMITTED A CRIME BY PICKING UP EVIDENCE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HERNANDEZ] I MADE PERSONAL STATEMENTS AS A
WITNESS. I TOLD THEM WHAT I SAW AND HEARD AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME.
THAT IS WHAT I DID.  THE PROSECUTORS ASKED ME ABOUT THE EVIDENCE I HAD
GATHERED AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME.  I PICKED UP FOUR BULLET CASINGS.
THE PROSECUTORS SAID I HAD COMMITTED A CRIME.  THAT IS, THEREFORE, THE
CRIME I COMMITTED.  [END RECORDING]

   ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FACTS TO FORMULATE AN
OPINION, HERNANDEZ SAID THAT AS AN INSTITUTION, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC
LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE, WHICH SHE DID NOT
MENTION, INDICATES THAT ARMED FORCES MEMBERS, WHO REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED,
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HERNANDEZ] THE CHURCH ALREADY ISSUED ITS
OFFICIAL DOCUMENT CLEARLY STATING THAT THERE ARE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS
INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

   [REPORTER] ON WHAT DOES THE CHURCH BASE THAT ASSERTION?

   [HERNANDEZ] ON THE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE ARCHBISHOPRIC
LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE.

   [REPORTER] YES, BUT WHAT PROOF DOES THE CHURCH HAVE TO MAKE THAT
ASSERTION?

   [HERNANDEZ] ALL THAT IS CONTAINED IN THE CHURCH DOCUMENT THAT WAS
ALREADY RELEASED.  YOU CAN GET THAT DOCUMENT IF YOU WANT.  [END
RECORDING]

   IN ADDITION, MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ DENIED STATEMENTS MADE BY SOME
MILITARY CHIEFS WHO SAID THAT WITNESS LUCIA CERNA, WHO IS OUT OF THE
COUNTRY, WAS NEVER MANIPULATED OR PRESSURED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HERNANDEZ] I WAS INTRODUCED TO MRS CERNA BY THE
HEAD OF THE PROVINCIAL JESUIT ORDER ON MONDAY, 20 NOVEMBER.  IN FRONT
OF HIM, MRS CERNA MADE HER STATEMENT.  AND SHE MADE THAT SAME
STATEMENT BEFORE THE JUDGE AND THE PROSECUTORS AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY.
THEY ARE WITNESSES TO THOSE STATEMENTS.

   IN OTHER WORDS, SHE MADE THE STATEMENT AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY
BEFORE I MET HER.  I COULD NOT HAVE MANIPULATED HER AT ALL.  [END
RECORDING]

   THE 4TH CRIMINAL COURT PROCEDURES REGARDING THIS CASE WILL CONTINUE
IN ORDER TO TRY TO CLARIFY THE DEATH OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDING
IGNACIO ELLACURIA.  CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER FIDEL CHAVEZ
MENA AND SAN SALVADOR AUXILIARY BISHOP MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ STILL
HAVE TO MAKE THEIR STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT.  


DEV-MUC3-0999 (SRI)

   BOGOTA, 15 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN SENATE TODAY
APPROVED A PARDON LAW THAT AUTHORIZES COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO TO "PARDON" OVER THE NEXT 6 MONTHS THE ARMED GROUPS THAT HAVE
DEMONSTRATED THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE.

   THE MEASURE INITIALLY FAVORS THE 19-APRIL MOVEMENT [M-19], WHICH
PROMISED THE GOVERNMENT TO SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS AND GIVE UP VIOLENCE
IN ORDER TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY.

   THE PARDON LAW IS ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT IN
THE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH THE M-19 AS A RESULT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS
THAT BEGAN LAST MARCH AND THAT SHOULD CONCLUDE WITH THE TOTAL
DEMOBILIZATION OF THE M-19 AND THE DELIVERY OF ITS WEAPONS TO THE
SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL.

   ONCE ITS MAIN LEADERS, AGAINST WHOM THERE ARE SERIOUS CHARGES FOR
AGGRESSION AGAINST THE STATE, ARE PARDONED, THE M-19 WILL BECOME A
LEGAL, POLITICAL GROUP.

   THE M-19 WAS SCHEDULED TO DELIVER ITS WEAPONS ON 19 DECEMBER, BUT
THE ACTION WAS SUSPENDED UNTIL A DECISION IS MADE REGARDING THE AGREED
UPON CREATION OF A "SPECIAL ELECTORAL DISTRICT, WHICH WOULD "GUARANTEE
THE M-19" AN ACTIVE PRESENCE IN THE NATIONAL CONGRESS.

   THAT MEASURE, WHICH IS PART OF THE "PACKAGE" OF CONSTITUTIONAL
REFORMS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT, WAS SUSPENDED AT THE CONGRESS,
WHICH COULD NOT REACH AN AGREEMENT ON IT BEFORE THE END OF ITS REGULAR
SESSION.

   THE REFORMS ALSO INCLUDED THE HOLDING OF A REFERENDUM TO CONSULT
THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ON THE EXTRADITION ISSUE.  LEGAL EXTRADITION WAS
ADOPTED THROUGH AN ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURE IN ORDER TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  THE COLOMBIAN CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES' APPROVAL OF
THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM CAUSED A
POLITICAL CRISIS WITH THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENTS OF THE LIBERAL
AND CONSERVATIVE PARTIES.

   TODAY THE PLENUM OF THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS DID NOT APPROVE THE
HOLDING OF A PLEBISCITE IN SEPTEMBER 1990, IN WHICH THE VOTERS WOULD
DECIDE TO EITHER APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG
TRAFFICKERS, BECAUSE OF THE RESIGNATIONS OF FORMER PRESIDENTS JULIO
CESAR TURBAY AYALA AND MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, LEADERS OF THE LIBERAL
AND CONSERVATIVE PARTIES, RESPECTIVELY.

   TODAY, IN ADDITION TO THE DECISION MADE IN CONGRESS, WHICH ALONG
WITH THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL CLOSE ITS REGULAR SESSION
PERIOD ON 17 DECEMBER, GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, A.K.A THE MEXICAN, ONE
OF THE MOST WANTED COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND THE NUMBER-TWO MAN
IN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS KILLED DURING A CLASH WITH THE POLICE.

   NO CITY (COLOMBIA), NO DATE -- [INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL CARLOS
ARTURO CASADIEGO TORRADO, SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE COLOMBIAN POLICE BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] GENERAL, WHO
CONDUCTED THE OPERATIONS -- THE ELITE FORCES, THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS
GROUP [GOES] ...HOW MANY UNITS PARTICIPATED IN THIS ACTION?

   [CASADIEGO] IT WAS A STRIKE THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY A SPECIALIZED
GROUP, BUT THE WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY ALL DEPARTMENTS OF THE
NATIONAL POLICE IN GENERAL.  THIS WORK WAS UNDERTAKEN BY ALL THOSE WHO
ARE IN CHARGE OF FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   [REPORTER] HOW WAS THE GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT INFORMED ABOUT
THIS?

   [CASADIEGO] JUST AS I AM REPORTING IT TO YOU.  I TOLD THE PRESIDENT
THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND 15 OTHERS AFTER
THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT.

   [REPORTER] WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT TELL YOU AFTER YOU GAVE HIM THE
NEWS?

   [CASADIEGO] IT WAS SIMPLY A NATIONAL POLICE REPORT TO THE
PRESIDENT.  LATER ON, WE WILL PROVIDE HIM WITH THE DETAILS AFTER THE
INSPECTORS RETURN.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ELSE DID YOU FIND IN THE AREA WHERE THE OPERATION
WAS CARRIED OUT?  DID YOU FIND WEAPONS?  WERE SOME PEOPLE ABLE TO
ESCAPE?

   [CASADIEGO] NO, I HAVE NO MORE DETAILS.  WE ARE JUST RECEIVING THE
INFORMATION OVER THE RADIO, AND WE CANNOT GIVE DETAILS OVER THE RADIO.

   [REPORTER] WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES REGARDING
THIS INFORMATION?

   [CASADIEGO] WITHOUT DOUBT, THIS INFORMATION WILL BE ANNOUNCED WITH
FULLER DETAILS BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL POLICE. THE GENERALS
AND THE NATIONAL POLICE STAFF ARE MEETING HERE.  WE ARE GOING TO
CONDUCT A SERIES OF OPERATIONS TO CONSOLIDATE THE AREA AND TO DO WHAT
THE LAW REQUIRES.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER MAJOR DRUG CARTEL LEADERS?

   [CASADIEGO] WE ARE DOING OUR JOB AND THIS IS PROOF THAT WE ARE
DOING OUR JOB.  I BELIEVE THAT COLOMBIA MUST CONGRATULATE THE NATIONAL
POLICE FOR THE JOB THEY HAVE DONE.

   [REPORTER] GENERAL, YOU HAVE SAID THE AREA IS BEING REINFORCED.
DOES THIS MEAN MORE NATIONAL POLICE TROOPS ARE BEING DEPLOYED TO THE
AREA?  WILL THE OPERATIONS CONTINUE IN SEARCH OF OTHER DRUG CARTEL
LEADERS?

   [CASADIEGO] WE ARE SEARCHING AND BLOCKING OFF THE AREA. THAT IS
WHAT WE ARE DOING.

   [REPORTER] IS THAT THE REPORT THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE RELEASED TO
THE GOVERNMENT AND TO COLOMBIANS?

   [CASADIEGO] THAT IS THE REPORT WE HAVE RELEASED TO THEM, AND WE ASK
ALL CITIZENS TO CONTINUE COOPERATING WITH US.  THEY CAN BE SURE THAT
WE WILL TRY TO SIGNIFICANTLY CUT THE NUMBER OF CRIMES BEING COMMITTED.
