   SAN SALVADOR, 3 JAN 90 -- [REPORT] [ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE,
COPREFA] [TEXT] THE ARCE BATTALION COMMAND HAS REPORTED THAT ABOUT 50
PEASANTS OF VARIOUS AGES HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY TERRORISTS OF THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] IN SAN MIGUEL
DEPARTMENT.  ACCORDING TO THAT GARRISON, THE MASS KIDNAPPING TOOK PLACE ON
30 DECEMBER IN SAN LUIS DE LA REINA.  THE SOURCE ADDED THAT THE TERRORISTS
FORCED THE INDIVIDUALS, WHO WERE TAKEN TO AN UNKNOWN LOCATION, OUT OF
THEIR RESIDENCES, PRESUMABLY TO INCORPORATE THEM AGAINST THEIR WILL INTO
CLANDESTINE GROUPS.

   MEANWHILE, THREE SUBVERSIVES WERE KILLED AND SEVEN OTHERS WERE WOUNDED
DURING CLASHES YESTERDAY IN USULUTAN AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS.  THE ATONAL
BATTALION REPORTED THAT ONE EXTREMIST WAS KILLED AND FIVE OTHERS WERE
WOUNDED DURING A CLASH YESTERDAY AFTERNOON NEAR LA ESPERANZA FARM, SANTA
ELENA JURISDICTION, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT.

   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT A SOLDIER WAS WOUNDED AND TAKEN TO THE MILITARY
HOSPITAL IN THIS CAPITAL.

   THE SAME MILITARY UNIT REPORTED THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER CLASH THAT RESULTED
IN ONE DEAD TERRORIST AND THE SEIZURE OF VARIOUS KINDS OF WAR MATERIEL NEAR
SAN RAFAEL FARM IN THE SAME TOWN.

   IN THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN REGION, MILITARY DETACHMENT NO.4 REPORTED THAT A
TERRORIST WAS KILLED AND TWO OTHERS WERE WOUNDED DURING A CLASH IN LA RANERA
STREAM, SAN CARLOS, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.  AN M-16 RIFLE, CARTRIDGE CLIPS, AND
AMMUNITION WERE SEIZED THERE.

   MEANWHILE, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE REPORTED THAT PONCE BATTALION UNITS
FOUND THE DECOMPOSED BODY OF A SUBVERSIVE IN LA FINCA HILL, SAN MIGUEL.  AN

FOUND IN THE SAME PLACE.  THE BRIGADE, WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN SAN MIGUEL,
ADDED THAT THE SEIZURE WAS MADE YESTERDAY MORNING. 

   NATIONAL GUARD UNITS GUARDING THE LAS CANAS BRIDGE, WHICH IS ON THE
NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY IN APOPA, THIS MORNING REPELLED A TERRORIST ATTACK
THAT RESULTED IN NO CASUALTIES.  THE ARMED CLASH INVOLVED MORTAR AND RIFLE
FIRE AND LASTED 30 MINUTES.  MEMBERS OF THAT SECURITY GROUP ARE COMBING THE
AREA TO DETERMINE THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE FIGHTING.

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS MADE BY A
SALVADORAN OFFICER TODAY, DESPITE THE CHANGE IN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
SALVADORAN AIR FORCE, THE AIR FORCE WILL CONTINUE ITS NORMAL ACTIVITIES.

   THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE MAINTAINS THE SAME OPERATIONAL LEVEL IT HAS HAD
FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, DESPITE THE REMOVAL OF ITS TOP COMMANDER, JAUN RAFAEL
BUSTILLOS, THIS WEEK.

   PARATROOPER BATTALION COMMANDER MAJOR RENE RODRIGUEZ HURTADO SAID TODAY
THAT THE AIR FORCE WILL CONTINUE TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND
TO MAINTAIN A SIMILAR OPERATIONAL LEVEL.

   [RODRIGUEZ] "WE KNOW GENERAL VILLAMARIONA [NEW AIR FORCE COMMANDER] ENOUGH
TO KNOW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR BATTALION'S ATTACKS ON ALL THE
TERRORIST CRIMINALS' REDOUBTS.  WE DEPEND DIRECTLY ON THE GENERAL STAFF,
SINCE IT IS THE STRATEGIC HEAD OF THE ENTIRE ARMY.  THE GENERAL STAFF GIVES
US OUR ORDERS TO LAUNCH OUR OPERATIONS."

   MAJOR RODRIGUEZ HURTADO TODAY DENIED THAT SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES HAD
ENTERED NICARAGUAN TERRITORY AS THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT SAID LAST WEEK.
MAJ RODRIGUEZ HURTADO SAID THAT SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES HAVE NEVER
ENTERED THE NEIGHBORING TERITORY OF NICARAGUA.

   [RODRIGUEZ] "I CAN TELL YOU THAT THOSE WERE NEITHER SALVADORAN NOR
HONDURAN PLANES.  IN MY OPINION, THE SANDINISTS WANT TO INVENT AN EXCUSE TO
CONTINUE HELPING THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  OURS
AND THE HONDURAN PLANES ARE SMALL PLANES.  I DO NOT THINK THAT HONDURAN
PLANES ENTERED NICARAGUAN TERRITORY.  THOSE COMMUNISTS ARE TRYING TO INVENT
AN EXCUSE TO CONTINUE HELPING THE FMLN TERRORIST CRIMINALS."

   MAJ. RODRIGUEZ MADE THESE STATEMENTS DURING THE PRESENTATION OF A NUMBER
OF WEAPONS CONFISCATED BY THE PARATROOPERS BATTALION ON 4 JANUARY.

   [RODRIGUEZ] "HERE WE HAVE 12 RIFLES, 11 AR-15 RIFLES AND 1 AK-47 RIFLE;
4,000 CARTRIDGES, OF WHICH 2,000 ARE FOR M-16 MACHINE GUNS AND 2,000 FOR
AK-47 RIFLES; 36 CARTRIDGES OF AN UNKNOWN CALIBER-- MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
HAS ALREADY BEEN INFORMED OF THIS DISCOVERY; AND I (ICON) RADIO OF THE TYPE
USED BY THE LEADERS OF THE TERRORIST GROUPS."

   THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND AT EL NISPERO CREEK NEAR THE SACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.
AMONG THE CONFISCATED WEAPONS WERE CARTRIDGES OF UNKNOWN MAKE.  THIS IS
APPPARENTLY THE FIRST TIME THE ARMY HAS FOUND THAT TYPE OF CARTRIDGE. MAJ
RODRIGUEZ HURTADO SAID THAT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE WILL PROCEED TO ESTABLISH
THE ORIGIN OF THESE CARTRIDGES AND THE WEAPONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE INTENDED.


DEV-MUC3-0003 (NOSC)

   SANTIAGO, 5 JAN 90 -- [EXCERPTS] THE GOVERNMENT JUNTA YESTERDAY APPROVED A
DRAFT BILL TO "MODIFY LAW 18314, WHICH DEFINES TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND
ESTABLISHES PENALTIES."  THE BILL WILL RESTRICT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW
TO THE MOST SERIOUS CASES AND WILL LEAVE OTHER CRIMES, THAT WERE FORMERLY
CONSIDERED TERRORIST ACTIVITY, FOR TRIAL UNDER COMMON LAW.

   THE NEW BILL ACCEPTS THE POSSIBILITY IN SOME CASES OF A PRISONER BEING
RELEASED ON BAIL OR RECEIVING A PARDON OR AMNESTY.  THE BILL ALSO
ESTABLISHES OTHER BENEFITS NOT CONTEMPLATED BY LAW 18314, INCLUDING A NEW
PROCEEDINGS FOR SPEEDIER TRIALS. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   ACCORDING TO RETIRED GENERAL FERNANDO TORRES SILVA, WHO IS THE ARMY JUDGE
ADVOCATE GENERAL, THE MODIFICATIONS ESTABLISH LIGHTER SENTENCES, FREEDOM ON
BAIL, AND POSSIBLE PARDONS OR AMNESTIES.  THESE BENEFITS WERE NOT
CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE FORMER ANTITERRORIST LAW.

   AS AN EXAMPLE TORRES CITED THAT "SENTENCES OF INDIVIDUALS TRIED AS
ACCOMPLICES WILL BE LOWER.  THEY WILL RECEIVE LOWER SENTENCES THAN THAT
PREVIOUSLY CONTEMPLATED."

   THE NEW BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TRIED
BY THE INTERIOR MINISTRY TO GO OUT ON BAIL.

   ACCORDING THE GENERAL ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, MORE THAN 1,000 PRISONERS MIGHT
BENEFIT FROM THE MODIFICATIONS.

   CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] GOODBYE [AIR FORCE COMMANDER] GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, FALSE
HOPE FOR MASS KILLERS.  GEN.  BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS
THE AIR FORCE CHIEF.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT
WITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.  BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN
OF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL
SALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER.

   FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.S. SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE
AIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE
DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE
COUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN,
TOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE
GENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN
EL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO.  BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS
AND U.S. AMBASSADORS HAVE.  AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE
IMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN
EL SALVADOR.

   AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE
OF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS.  HE ACCUSES [FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER
EUGENIO] VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN.  ONE
WOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS
MOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS,
MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT
MURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.  WAS THE U.S. PENTAGON SOFT
WHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF
GENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY?

   THE U.S. STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE
PAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT
REBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED
HAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE.  BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY.

   THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND.  THROUGH AN
ACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE.  BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES
GENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE.  BUSTILLO
ACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE
TOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.  A
POLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR
SECTORS.  OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY.
BUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR
DEMOCRACY.  IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL
OPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT
SUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY.  IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS
NOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION.  THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS
IT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT
THEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES:
TO STOP THE FMLN.

   THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF
THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG
DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID.  THE JESUITS' MURDERS
AND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING
FOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS.  HOWEVER, THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN
OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF] AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER
THIS RESPONSIBILITY.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS.

   BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL
BEGIN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID.  BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S
SCAPEGOAT.  HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS
MACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE.  WILL THE U.S. PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE
APPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY?  TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE
OBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR.  WHILE PEOPLES
OF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO
LEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER,
COMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH,
THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  GOODBYE, GEN. BUSTILLO.  WE CONTINUE
WRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU.  THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY,
INDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THAT IS WHY FOREIGN INTERVENTION AND
THE WALLS OF INTOLERANCE HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE THE
PEOPLE GROW IN HEROISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IS NOT DETERRED BY
BOMBINGS.

INDICATES THAT ON 6 JANUARY AT 1625, FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] TROOPS CLASHED WITH THE CAVALRY COMPANY IN FINCA
SANTA ELENA, SANTA TECLA, NEAR SAN SALVADOR, KILLING THREE AND
WOUNDING FOUR ENEMY TROOPS, INCLUDING THE PATROL LEADER WHO WAS AMONG
THOSE KILLED.  OUR TROOPS SEIZED AN M-14 RIFLE FROM THE ENEMY, 3,000
CARTRIDGES FOR A 7.62-MM RIFLE, FIVE KNAPSACKS, SIX GRENADES, AND

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY TODAY
PREVENTED THE OCCUPATION OF CITIES IN THE EASTERN PART OF EL SALVADOR,
WAGING STRONG CLASHES BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND DAWN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY
MILITARY SOURCES.

   THE ATTACKS, ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, TOOK PLACE IN USULUTAN, USULUTAN
DEPARTMENT, 110 KM EAST OF THE CAPITAL, AND IN SANTA ELENA WHERE AS OF 0700
CLASHES WERE STILL UNDER WAY.  SANTA ELENA IS LOCATED 119 KM EAST OF THE
CAPITAL, AND BOTH CITIES ARE COFFEE REGIONS.

   IN USULUTAN, 6TH BRIGADE TROOPS AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT BATTALIONS REPELLED
THE INCURSION WITH ARTILLERY FIRE.  DURING THE 2D WEEK OF DECEMBER, THERE HAD
BEEN STRONG CLASHES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN, IN WHAT THE GUERRILLAS
CALLED THE "BATTLE OF EL NISPERAL," IN THE CANTON THAT BEARS THE SAME NAME,
WHICH COST THE ARMY 29 DEAD, ALTHOUGH IT HAS ONLY ADMITTED TO 21 DEATHS.

   IN SANTA ELENA THE CLASHES WERE ALSO STRONG, BUT SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO
REPORTS OF CASUALTIES ON EITHER SIDE.

   FROM SAN VICENTE, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY, WHERE THE
CHICHONTEPEC VOLCANO IS LOCATED, STRONG CLASHES WERE REPORTED, AND THE 5TH
BRIGADE BOMBED REBEL POSITIONS ON THE COLCANO, WHERE THE FMLN HAS STRONG
BASTIONS.

   THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS CARRYING OUT OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN SAN
SALVADOR.  AND ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL THIS MORNING POWERFUL
EXPLOSIONS, CHARACTERIZED AS MILITARY ACTIONS TO PREVENT REBELS FROM
GATHERING, COULD BE HEARD.  THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST, THERE WERE ATTEMPTS TO
ENTER THE CAPITAL FROM THAT DIRECTION.

   THE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS SURVEILLANCE TO PREVENT MOBILIZATIONS, AND
THROUGH CAREFUL SEARCHES VEHICLES ARE BEING CONTROLLED AT THE CAPITAL CITY'S
ENTRANCES AND EXITS.

   IN OTHER ACTIONS, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED AT LEAST SIX
FMLN DEATHS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   LAST NIGHT THERE WERE FEWER ATTACKS ON STORES AND ELECTRIC TOWERS IN THE
CAPITAL.  THERE WERE ALSO THREATS OF POWER RATIONING IF THESE ACTIONS
CONTINUED.

   SANTIAGO, 9 JAN 90 -- [COMMENTARY] [OLGA KLIVADENKO] [TEXT] THE
DEPLOYMENT OF U.S.  SHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER "JOHN F.
KENNEDY" AND THE CORVETTE "VIRGINIA" ALONG THE COLOMBIAN COAST YESTERDAY,
SEEKING TO INTERCEPT DRUG TRAFFICKING ROUTES, COULD BE THE RESULT OF THREE
POLICIES:

   FIRST, THAT THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO JUSTIFY THE INVASION OF PANAMA
UNDER THE EXCUSE OF ITS FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   SECOND, THAT BOTH THE DEPLOYMENT OF SHIPS AND THE INVASION OF PANAMA ARE
PART OF A SERIOUS MILITARY PLAN TO END THE DRUG PLAGUE.

   THIRD, THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST SOMEHOW JUSTIFY THE INVASION OF PANAMA
AND THE NEED TO RECOVER ITS INTERNATIONAL IMAGE HAS PROVIDED A REAL
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT AN END TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   IF THE OBJECTIVE REALLY IS TO ELIMINATE DRUGS, THEN THE BATTLE IS
PRAISEWORTHY, BUT--LIKE IN PANAMA--THE PROCEDURE IS PAINFUL, OVERBEARING,
IMPERIALISTIC, AND HUMILIATING.  INSTEAD OF WINNING THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES' APPRECIATION AND SOLIDARITY WITH THIS LAUDABLE CAUSE, THE UNITED
STATES IS AGAIN PROVOKING ANGRY REACTIONS AND DEEP DISTRUST.  THE SIDE
EFFECTS OF THIS ACTION COULD BE VERY NEGATIVE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING, IN WHICH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THIS CONTINENT SHOULD BE
COOPERATING.  ALTERNATIVELY, WOULD IT BE BETTER IF THEY DID NOT COOPERATE IN
THIS PHASE?

   COULD IT BE THAT WHAT WE HAVE CALLED IMPERIALISTIC CLUMSINESS,
INSENSIBILITY, AND ABUSE, IS SIMPLY A DELIBERATE STRATEGY WITH WHICH,
PERHAPS FOR WELL FOUNDED REASONS AND EVEN AT THE RISK OF DIPLOMATIC
CONFLICTS, THE UNITED STATES SEEKS TO ISOLATE LATIN AMERICA ON PURPOSE AND
THUS ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF ITS OPERATION?  IF THIS WERE THE CASE THEN WE
MUST ASK, WHY?

   FROM ITS OPERATIONS IN PANAMA AND COLOMBIA, THE UNITED STATES IS TELLING
US THAT IT IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE DIPLOMATIC ASPECT FOR THE TIME BEING.
THE UNITED STATES WANTS ACTION AND EFFICIENCY.  THE UNITED STATES IS LOSING
ITS PATIENCE, AND PERHAPS ITS CONFIDENCE IN THE SERIOUSNESS AND CAPABILITY OF
LATIN AMERICA TO FACE THIS WAR.

   IF THE ACTION IN COLOMBIA GOES FURTHER THAN A MERE SURVEILLANCE, THE
UNITED STATES WILL BE ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT IN THIS BATTLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  THIS MEANS THAT DURING A FIRST PHASE THE UNITED STATES WILL
CARRY OUT A MILITARY OPERATION BY ITSELF.  DURING A SECOND PHASE IT WILL
DISCUSS SECONDARY SUBJECTS BUT WITH LESS URGENCY IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.

   NEXT 15 FEBRUARY, BUSH WILL MEET IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, COLOMBIA, WITH
HIS COLOMBIAN, PERUVIAN, AND BOLIVIAN COUNTERPARTS.  PERHAPS ON THAT OCCASION
THEY WILL TALK ABOUT THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS WAR: THE REORGANIZATION OF
THE LOCAL ECONOMIES TO END THE DEPENDENCY ON COCA PLANTATIONS, THE RECOVERY
OF DRUG ADDICTS, AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF GOVERNMENTS, ETC.

   DURING THIS CURRENT PHASE, HOWEVER, THE UNITED STATES WISHES TO ACT ALONE.
WHO KNOWS IF IT IS BECAUSE OF LATIN AMERICA'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING?  AS WE
SAID A FEW DAYS AGO, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM IS CREATING NEW SITUATIONS
IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  THE U.S. PROPOSAL IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE:
COULD A WORLD POWER LIKE THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO IGNORE A SERIOUS
PROBLEM LIKE THE PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS, MERELY
TO AVOID HARMING LATIN AMERICAN SENSIBILITIES, SENSIBILITIES OF COUNTRIES
WHOSE GOVERNMENTS ARE ALWAYS MUDDLED UP IN USELESS DIPLOMATIC AND
BUREAUCRATIC PROCEDURES AND FRUITLESS NEGOTIATIONS?  AND ALL THIS WHILE A
LARGE PART OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD'S POPULATION IS BECOMING ADDICTED TO A
DEADLY PRODUCT?

   THE UNITED STATES COULD ALSO BE ASKING ITSELF: HAVE THE LATIN AMERICAN
GOVERNMENTS BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM BY THEMSELVES?  CAN
THOSE GOVERNMENTS STOP DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT DRUGS AND
CORRUPTION GO HAND IN HAND; WHEN IN THE PAST AND PERHAPS IN THE PRESENT,
HIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN LINKED WITH THIS ILLEGAL TRADE
AND PROTECTING THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS?  WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER ALL THIS
HASN'T THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO EXTRADITE THE MAIN CHIEFS OF THAT
CARTEL TO THE UNITED STATES?

   LET US RECALL THE HORRIBLE EXPLOSION OF THE COLOMBIAN AIRLINER, IN WHICH
MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE DIED; THE BOMB EXPLOSION IN THE SECRET POLICE
HEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA; THE MURDER OF MANY JOURNALISTS WHO WERE ENGAGED IN
AN HEROIC WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING; AND MAINLY, LET US RECALL THE
EVER-PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST BE FACED WHEN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS
MUST BE PUNISHED AND EXTRADITED.

ACHI, IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT OF BOLIVAR, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED ON 5
JANUARY, APPARENTLY BY ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) GUERRILLAS, WAS
FOUND DEAD TODAY, ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES.

   CASTELLAR WAS KIDNAPPED ON 5 JANUARY ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ACHI, ABOUT 850
KM NORTH OF BOGOTA, BY A GROUP OF ARMED MEN, WHO FORCED HIM TO ACCOMPANY
THEM TO AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION.

   POLICE SOURCES IN CARTAGENA REPORTED THAT CASTELLAR'S BODY SHOWED SIGNS OF
TORTURE AND SEVERAL BULLET WOUNDS.

   CASTELLAR WAS KIDNAPPED BY ELN GUERRILLAS WHILE HE WAS TRAVELING IN A BOAT
DOWN THE CAUCA RIVER TO THE TENCHE AREA, A REGION WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION.

   IN CARTAGENA IT WAS REPORTED THAT CASTELLAR FACED A "REVOLUTIONARY TRIAL"
BY THE ELN AND THAT HE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND EXECUTED.

   CASTELLAR IS THE SECOND MAYOR THAT HAS BEEN MURDERED IN COLOMBIA IN THE

CORDOVA LEFT THE EMBASSY.  THE MILITARY MAN, WHO IS INVOLVED IN A
MURDER TRIAL, LEFT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AS SOON AS HE LEARNED THAT THE

BIT.  AS FAR AS WE KNOW, PEOPLE SOUGHT PROTECTION....[CHANGES THOUGHT]
SOMEONE ARRIVES AT THE DOOR OF THE EMBASSY AND ASKS FOR REFUGE IN VIEW OF A
SITUATION OF FORCE.  THE SITUATION IN PANAMA IS ABNORMAL; IT HAS BEEN
TOTALLY INVADED BY 30,000 SOLDIERS.

   SOME PERSONS ENTERED THE EMBASSY.  AT LEAST ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN ALLEGEDLY
LINKED WITH THE DEATH OF A PANAMANIAN MINISTER, A MR SPADAFORA, WHO WAS
MURDERED. THE AUTHORITIES OF THE EMBASSY AND OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY STATED
THAT THIS PERSON'S PRESENCE WAS UNDESIRABLE.  WE DO NOT REFUSE TO GRANT
REFUGE--A CONDITION THAT IS GRANTED BEFORE GRANTING POLITICAL ASYLUM--TO
WHOMEVER FEELS HARASSED OR MISTREATED.  IN A CASE LIKE THIS, HOWEVER, IN
WHICH THERE WAS AN ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN A MURDER WHICH WAS COMMITTED YEARS
AGO, THIS PERSON--I BELIEVE HE IS A MAN SURNAMED CORDOVA, APPARENTLY A
HIGHRANKING PANAMANIAN GUARD OFFICER--WAS TOLD THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS NOT
WANTED.  HE LEFT THE EMBASSY OF HIS OWN WILL.

   THERE ARE OTHER PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES OFFICERS AT THE EMBASSY,
INCLUDING MR NORIEGA'S SECRETARY, BUT THEIR STATUS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED BY
PERU.

   AN INCIDENT WAS REPORTED YESTERDAY, AS THE U.S. TROOPS SURROUNDED THE
EMBASSY, DEPLOYING BARRIERS AND BARBED WIRE.

   THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DEPICT A DRAMATIC AND SPECTACULAR PICTURE OF A

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS EXPRESSED
SATISFACTION WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND
IS ENCOURAGING THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF
THIS CRIME.

   MONSIGNOR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ TODAY STATED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS
PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS.  HE SAID THAT IF THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED IN THE KILLING ARE
PUNISHED, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ONLY EARN INTERNATIONAL PRESTIGE, BUT WILL
LAY THE GROUNDWORK TO CONSOLIDATE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL
SALVADOR.

   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT IF THE KILLING IS SOLVED, THE PERIOD OF IMPUNITY
THAT HAS TARNISHED THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND COVERED UP A NUMBER OF CRIMES TO
WHICH JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED WILL END.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ROSA CHAVEZ] IT SEEMS THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE
RECOGNIZED FOR HAVING HAD THE COURAGE TO KEEP HIS PROMISE TO CONDUCT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS NOT YET REVEALED THE
DETAILS OF THIS CRIME BUT THAT HE WILL DO SO SOON.

   HOWEVER, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN SAID: THE CHURCH IS NOT
INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHO THE MURDERERS ARE JUST FOR THE TRUTH TO COME
OUT.  THE CHURCH WANTS THIS PUNISHMENT TO MEAN THAT IMPUNITY HAS ENDED IN EL
SALVADOR; THAT THE POOR WILL FEEL CERTAIN THAT JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL FOR
THEM; THAT SO MANY CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN WILL BE SOLVED LITTLE BY
LITTLE; BUT MAINLY, THAT FROM NOW ON, CRIMES WILL NO LONGER GO UNSOLVED.
[END RECORDING]

   MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ ADDED THAT THE TONE OF VERBAL VIOLENCE MUST BE LOWERED
SINCE THIS ONLY RESULTS IN A USELESS CONFRONTATION AND PROMOTES A
POLARIZATION OF THE CONFLICT, AS WELL AS HINDERS ANY EFFORT TO APPLY
JUSTICE.  HE SAID THAT THE VERBAL WAR IS AS HARMFUL AS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.
HE SAID THAT IRRESPONSIBLE CHARGES AND ACCUSATIONS CONTINUE IN THE COUNTRY,
AND THEY DO NOT HELP STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ROSA CHAVEZ] IT IS IMPORTANT TO OVERCOME VERBAL
VIOLENCE.  THIS MEANS THAT A CALM CLIMATE, A CLIMATE THAT IS AS IMPARTIAL AS
POSSIBLE, MUST BE SOUGHT TO DISCUSS ISSUES.  WE RECALL THAT LAST YEAR, MANY
VIOLENT STATEMENTS WERE MADE.  MANY HARSH EXPRESSIONS WERE UTTERED.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] TOO MANY HEATED STATEMENTS PRINTED IN SOME NEWSPAPERS.  THE
LANGUAGE USED IS TOO HARSH.  I THINK THAT TO OBTAIN JUSTICE, WE NEED A
CALMER CLIMATE. [END RECORDING]

   HE ADDED THAT A CLIMATE OF SERENITY AND RESPECT WOULD FACILITATE THE RIGHT
CONDITIONS FOR A DIALOGUE THAT WOULD GUARANTEE MECHANISMS TO RECONCILE OUR
SOCIETY.  HE URGED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES TO CONTINUE
MAKING PROGRESS IN THE REVIEW OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO REORGANIZE IT IN A
WAY THAT WILL ALLOW THE HONEST ADMINSTRATION OF JUSTICE TO DO AWAY WITH
IMPUNITY.

ON 16 NOVEMBER AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN SAN SALVADOR.

   CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED ON SUNDAY THAT "MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES"
PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME, AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL BRING THOSE
INDIVIDUALS TO JUSTICE IN EL SALVADOR, "REGARDLESS OF WHOM THEY MAY BE."

   SANDOVAL POINTED OUT THAT "MORE THAN SEVEN PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE
MURDER, AND TWO PERPETRATED IT."  HE ADDED THAT TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS ACTED,
ONE THAT MURDERED THE CLERGYMEN AND ANOTHER THAT MURDERED TWO MAIDS,
ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY RESULTS ISSUED BY THE CRIME COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF
SOLVING THE CASE.

   "THERE WAS NO TORTURE OR MISTREATMENT, BUT WORDS WERE EXCHANGED" BETWEEN
THE MURDERERS AND VICTIMS, THE SPOKESMAN SAID, ADDING THAT FIVE OF THE
MURDERED JESUITS HAD RECEIVED "FINISHING SHOTS," ACCORDING TO AUTOPSIES
CARRIED OUT BY SALVADORAN FORENSIC DOCTORS.

   ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY THE COMMISSION GATHERED FROM 115 MEMBERS OF THE
ARMY AND 103 CIVILIANS, THE MURDER TOOK PLACE BETWEEN 0200 AND 0300, AND
THERE WERE "EXPLOSIONS, MACHINE-GUN BLASTS, AND SHOTS," SANDOVAL SAID.

   THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT 2 OFFICERS AND 45 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN "CONFINED IN
VARIOUS HEADQUARTERS PENDING INVESTIGATION."

   AT LEAST 230 CARTRIDGES OF VARIOUS CALIBER, INCLUDING SOME FOR SOVIET MADE
AK-47'S, M-79 ANTITANK WEAPONS, AND M-67 GRENADES, WERE FOUND AT THE SITE OF
THE MURDER, THE OFFICIAL SAID.

THAT SEVERAL GUERRILLA ATTACKS AND HEAVY FIGHTING TOOK PLACE THE EVENING
OF 9 JANUARY AND THIS MORNING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND AS A RESULT,
THREE SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND THREE OTHERS INJURED.

   ALLEGED GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDOS LAUNCHED TWO HIGHPOWER BOMBS AGAINST A
CAR DEALERSHIP IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR THIS MORNING.  A POLICE REPORT SAID
THAT THE ATTACK SET THE BUILDING ON FIRE, BUT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY
CASUALTIES ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC LOSSES ARE HEAVY.

   DURING THE EVENING OF 9 JANUARY, GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDOS BOMBED TWO
ELECTRICITY FACILITIES IN DIFFERENT PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH CAUSED
POWER OUTAGES IN SOME AREAS OF THE CAPITAL.

U.S.  CITIZEN BEING HELD IN PRISON WHILE AWAITING TRIAL ON
DRUG-TRAFFICKING CHARGES, HAS BEEN STABBED TO DEATH IN THE PAVON PRISON
CAMP, 18 KM SOUTHEAST OF THIS CAPITAL.

   KENT JR, AND ANOTHER PERSON WHOSE NAME AND NATIONALITY THE POLICE HAVE NOT
REVEALED, WERE ARRESTED IN JULY 1989 ALONG THE SOUTHERN COAST OF GUATEMALA
WHEN THE LIGHT PLANE IN WHICH THE TWO WERE TRAVELING HAD TO MAKE AN
EMERGENCY LANDING.

   ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT FOLLOWED, THE PLANE WAS TRANSPORTING
COCAINE FROM COLOMBIA TO THE UNITED STATES.

   OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT KENT JR WAS UNEXPECTEDLY ATTACKED BY
THREE OTHER PAVON PRISON INMATES WIELDING KNIVES.

   PRISON GUARDS CAPTURED THE ATTACKERS BUT DID NOT REPORT THEIR NAMES.

   PRISON SYSTEM DIRECTOR LEONEL FRANCO STATED TODAY THAT THE AMERICAN HAD
NOT BEEN SENTENCED AND THAT HIS CASE WAS BEING PROCESSED BY A COURT OF
JUSTICE.

   ON 28 SEPTEMBER, THE U.S. EMBASSY IN GUATEMALA HAD REQUESTED THE
EXTRADITION OF KENT JR FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG-TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES
AND BECAUSE OF HIS POSSIBLE LINKS WITH THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.

   CLANDESTINE, 11 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)]
[TEXT] REGARDING THE JESUITS' CASE, THE FMLN STATES THAT:

   1. THE FMLN AND SEVERAL SECTORS, INCLUDING YOUNG ARMED FORCES OFFICERS,
WERE RIGHT IN POINTING TO THE ARMY AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HORRIBLE
CRIME.  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED INSTITUTION FOR THIS CASE AND THE
CASES INVOLVING FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION],
MONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE NUNS, AND THE U.S. AGRARIAN EXPERTS, AS WELL AS FOR
THE BOMBINGS IN THE CITIES AND MASSACRES IN THE RURAL SECTOR, SHOW THAT WE
WERE RIGHT WHEN WE MENTIONED IN OUR LAST PEACE PROPOSAL THE NEED TO CLEAN UP
THE ARMY AND REFORM THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

   2. TO ADVANCE IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE
THIS CASE.  THE OTHER CASES NEED TO BE SOLVED AND THOSE GUILTY FOR THEM
SHOULD BE PUNISHED.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES CANNOT REMAIN AT
THE LEVEL OF OFFICERS AND TROOPS WHO ONLY CARRIED OUT ORDERS.  MOST
IMPORTANT IS TO ESTABLISH RESPONSIBILITY AMONG HIGHER-RANKING OFFICERS
BECAUSE A DECISION OF THIS SORT COULD NOT BE BEYOND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
THE TOP COMMAND.

   3. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS
CONCERNING DEMOCRATIZATION; REFORMING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; LIFTING THE STATE
OF EMERGENCY; REESTABLISHING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MOBILIZATION, AND
ORGANIZATION; RELEASING THE MORE THAN 3,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND
STOPPING THE REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS.  

   4. THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY CRISTIANI IS AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE COMPLICATED
DISCUSSIONS ON U.S. AID FOR EL SALVADOR AND TO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS
AID TO MAINTAIN THE WAR.  IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO INCREASE AID TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMY BECAUSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR BECAUSE THE CASE MAY BE
RESOLVED.  SUCH AID WOULD LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING A CASE LIKE
THAT OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS HAPPENING AGAIN.  THE BEST WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS TO CEASE AID.  WE APPEAL TO THE U.S. CONGRESS TO MAKE
THIS DECISION.  IF THIS IS DONE, THE FMLN WOULD COMMIT ITSELF TO MAKING
EFFORTS TO REACH AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.

   5. FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS DEPEND ON JUSTICE-MAKING
PROGRESS.  IF THE ARMY IS THOROUGHLY PURGED BECAUSE OF THIS CASE, PEACE
COULD BE REACHED EARLIER.

   6. TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A PROMPT PEACE, WE WILL ASK THE OFFICE OF THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL TO MEDIATE.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO JOINTLY MEET WITH
US AND WITH MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS TO RENEW THE
DIALOGUE-NEGOTIATION PROCESS.

   7. THE FMLN WILL BE WATCHING HOW THE SITUATION DEVELOPS.  IT URGES
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO EXERT PRESSURE SO THAT THE
INVESTIGATION PROCESS DOES NOT END WITH A DECLARATION OF INTENTION OR WITH
STATEMENTS BLAMING LOW-RANKING SOLDIERS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE MOST
RESPONSIBLE.  THIS WOULD PUSH AWAY THE POSSIBILTIY OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION
TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.

HANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, AND FRANCISCO JOVEL.

   BOGOTA, 11 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES, THE FARC [REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA] LAUNCHED A NEW
OFFENSIVE TO RECOVER THE REGION OF MIDDLE MAGDALENA THAT WAS LOST TO GONZALO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS MEN 5 YEARS AGO.  THIS IS THE REASON FOR FIERCE
FIGHTING THERE BETWEEN THE ARMY AND SEVERAL FARC FRONTS DURING THE FIRST FEW
DAYS OF THIS YEAR.  HEAVILY ARMED AND STRENGTHENED THESE FRONTS ARE TRYING
TO MILITARILY TAKE OVER AREAS THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA'S DEPUTIES HAVE BEEN
VACATING BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS CREATED IN THEIR ORGANIZATION BY THE DEATH OF
EL MEJICANO [GONZALO RODRIGUEZ' ALIAS].

   THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT THE RETURN TO THE STRATEGY OF USING
KIDNAPPINGS AS A MEANS TO FINANCE ITSELF IS ALSO PART OF THIS NEW OFFENSIVE
THAT SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING THE SUPPORT OF OTHER GUERRILLA GROUPS SUCH AS THE
EPL [POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY].

   MEANWHILE, IN LA URIBE THE FARC GENERAL SECRETARIAT HAS SUBMITTED ANOTHER
PEACE PROPOSAL TO PRESIDENT BARCO.  THE GUERRILLA GROUP STATES THAT IT IS
WILLING TO ESTABLISH A NEW POLITICAL PARTY CALLED BOLIVARIAN REUNION OF THE
PEOPLE [REUNION BOLIVARIANA DEL PUEBLO] IF THE GOVERNMENT CALLS A PLESBICITE
TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.

   THE PROPOSAL WAS RECEIVED ON 9 JANUARY DIRECTLY FROM THE HANDS OF FARC
LEADERS BY MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORY BOARD FOR PEACE ISSUES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [RAFAEL PARDO, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR FOR PEACE AND
REHABILITATION] THE GOVERNMENT MUST ASSESS THE PROPOSAL IT HAS RECEIVED, AS
WELL AS FARC'S SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT SHOULD RESUME
TALKS WITH THIS ORGANIZATION. [END RECORDING]

   FOR THE TIME BEING, MEMBERS OF THE ADVISORY BOARD WILL TRAVEL TO SANTO
DOMINGO THIS WEEKEND TO CONTINUE STUDYING WITH THE M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT]
THE POSSIBILITIES OF INCORPORATING IT INTO POLITICAL LIFE FOLLOWING THE
COLLAPSE OF THE SPECIAL PEACE DISTRICT ISSUE IN CONGRESS.

   ROME (ITALY), 11 JAN 90 -- [INTERVIEW WITH DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE
LEADER RUBEN ZAMORA BY ALESSANDRO OPPES] [EXCERPT] [PASSAGE OMITTED]
[OPPES] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS
DESCRIBED THE ARREST OF FIVE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THE
MASSACRE [OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS] AS "A MANIPULATED COVER OPERATION."
BASICALLY, CRISTIANI IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DECIDED TO PUNISH A NUMBER OF
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS TO CLOSE THE CASE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO
END INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION IN THIS REGARD?

   [ZAMORA] THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MEMBERS OF
THE ARMY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASSACRE IS A FIRST STEP AND DEFINITELY A
GOOD THING, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY INSUFFICIENT UNLESS THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS ARE
ALSO TAKEN.  FIRST, TO IDENTIFY WHO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE:  THIS IS
THE FIRST IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE NOBODY CAN FEEL SATISFIED IF ONLY
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS ARE IDENTIFIED.  SUCH AN ACT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN ORDERED
BY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO,
FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SENTENCES AND NO TRIALS.

   [OPPES] HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY DENIED
INVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATION, STATING THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED ACTION
"DIVORCED FROM ANY INSTITUTIONAL POLICY."

   [ZAMORA] I BELIEVE THIS IS ENTIRELY WRONG: THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT
FATHERS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISOLATED ACTION.  OVER 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE
DIED IN EL SALVADOR DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, AND 90 PERCENT OF THEM WERE
CIVILIANS.  POLITICAL ASSASSINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES IS A CONSTANT
PRACTICE.  FURTHERMORE, TORTURE IS REGULARLY PRACTISED IN EL SALVADOR.  THE
ARMY HIGH COMMAND CANNOT FAIL TO KNOW THIS.  THEY CANNOT CLAIM TO BE
INNOCENT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS.

   [OPPES] YET LAST MONTH THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HEADS OF STATE IN
SAN JOSE ENDED WITH A SUCCESS FOR PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHO SECURED AN
EXPLICIT CONDEMNATION OF THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GUERRILLAS IN
NOVEMBER, WHEREAS NO SPECIFIC CHARGES WERE LEVELED AT THE GOVERNMENT FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

   [ZAMORA] THERE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND, NAMELY,
THE CALL FROM THE FIVE PRESIDENTS FOR A RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE IN EL
SALVADOR AND THE APPEAL TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO CARRY OUT MEDIATION
TO THIS END.  BUT IN THE SUMMIT'S FINAL DOCUMENT, IT IS THE FMLN AND THE
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS WHO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PRESIDENTS:
THESE ARE DIPLOMATIC GAMES THAT DO NOT FACILITATE THE RESTORATION OF PEACE
IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   [OPPES] WHAT PATHS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO ADVANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS?

   [ZAMORA] NEGOTIATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY NECESSARY.  THE GUERRILLA
OFFENSIVE SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS A STRONG MILITARY FORCE, BUT ALSO THAT A
REVOLUTIONARY ATTITUDE DOES NOT EXIST AMONG THE MASSES.  IT ALSO SHOWS THAT
THE GOVERNMENT ARMY, AFTER 10 YEARS OF U.S. TRAINING, IS AN ARMY WHOSE
MILITARY STANCE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE (WHICH IS THE KEY TO U.S.
MILITARY STRATEGY.)  WHILE THIS ALL SHOWS THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT PRECISELY FOLLOWING
THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE (AND THIS IS THE PARADOX) THE ARMY STIFFENED ITS
STANCE AGAINST NEGOTIATIONS.  I BELIEVE THAT SOONER OR LATER COMMON SENSE
WILL PREVAIL AND IT WILL SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  AT THE END OF
NOVEMBER THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE'S ASSISTANT FOR LATIN AMERICA SPOKE
OFFICIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE THE
CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGN OF A CHANGING SITUATION.

DEFENSE MINISTER ENRIQUE LOPEZ ALBUJAR.

   GENERAL OSVALDO DIAZ SALVADOR, CHIEF OF THE 7TH SUBREGION OF THE NATIONAL
POLICE, HAS CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF THE LEAFLETS, AND ADDED THAT THE
MURDER CASE IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED.  HE SAID THAT AMONG THE THOUSANDS
OF DETAINEES THERE ARE 16 SUSPECTS WHO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN
THE MURDER OF THE OUTSTANDING GENERAL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DIAZ SALVADOR] WELL, THERE ARE TWO OPERATIONS.  FIRST,
THE DRAGNET OPERATION, IN WHICH PEOPLE WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS ESTABLISHED
BY WITNESSES ARE ARRESTED, AND SECOND, THERE IS A MORE SPECIFIC OPERATION
BEING CONDUCTED BY THE SPECIALIZED UNITS.

   [REPORTER] IS THERE ANY INFORMATION YET REGARDING THE CAPTURE OF THE
MURDERERS OF THE FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] THESE OPERATIONS SEEK TO CLEAR UP BOTH A CRIME THAT HAS
SHOCKED THE NATION AND ALSO THE KILLING OF TWO PATROLMEN WHO WERE MURDERED
IN COLD BLOOD THE DAY BEFORE THE GENERAL WAS MURDERED.

   [REPORTER] DO THE POLICE HAVE IDENTIKITS OF THE MURDERERS?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME IDENTIKITS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE
PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK FROM THE SPECIALIZED UNITS OF THE TECHNICAL
POLICE.  BASED ON THESE IDENTIKITS THE POLICE WILL BE MORE SPECIFIC AND
SELECTIVE.

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY IDENTIKITS DO YOU HAVE SO FAR?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] SO FAR WE HAVE RECEIVED THREE IDENTIKITS.

   [REPORTER] THE MURDER IS ATTRIBUTED TO MRTA AND NOT TO THE SHINING PATH.
WHAT NEWS DO THE HAVE ON THIS?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] I BELIEVE THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WILL HAVE THE FINAL
WORD ON THIS.

   [REPORTER] IS IT TRUE THAT THE MRTA HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
MURDER?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] WELL, WE ALL KNOW THAT SOME LEAFLETS HAVE APPEARED TODAY
INSIDE A NEWSPAPER THAT CLAIMS TO BE THE MOUTHPIECE ON THIS MATTER, BUT I DO
NOT THINK THIS IS FINAL.  [END RECORDING]

IN LA PAZ LAST NIGHT, ONE IN FRONT OF GOVERNMENT HOUSE FOLLOWING THE

JAIME PAZ ZAMORA.

   THE EXPLOSIONS DID NOT CAUSE ANY SERIOUS DAMAGE BUT THE POLICE WERE
MOBILIZED, FEARING A WAVE OF ATTACKS.

   THE SELF-STYLED "ZARATE WILLKA LIBERATION ARMED FORCES" SENT SIMULTANEOUS
WRITTEN MESSAGES TO THE MEDIA, CALLING ON THE PEOPLE TO OPPOSE THE

EXPLOITERS."  IT ALSO CALLS FOR FREE EDUCATION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
PERMANENT JOBS, THE DEFENSE OF COCA-LEAF FARMING, AND THE DEFENSE AGAINST
U.S. INTERVENTION AND BIG LAND OWNERS.

   THE FIRST BOMB ATTACK OCCURRED AT 2230 [0230 GMT ON 12 JANUARY] IN FRONT
OF THE PLANNING AND ECONOMIC COORDINATION MINISTRY, JUST BEFORE PRESIDENT
PAZ ZAMORA CONCLUDED HIS MESSAGE TO THE NATION IN WHICH HE EXPLAINED THE
GUIDELINES OF THE GENERAL ECONOMIC PROGRAM THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL
IMPLEMENT BETWEEN 1990 AND 1993.

   ROBERTO BARBERY, INTERIOR MINISTRY INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR, HAS

   THE SECOND ATTACK OCCURRED AT 2335 [0335 GMT ON 12 JANUARY], JUST AFTER
THE CABINET MEMBERS HAD LEFT GOVERNMENT HOUSE WHERE THEY HAD LISTENED TO THE
PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE.

   A BOMB WAS PLACED OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT HOUSE IN THE PARKING LOT THAT IS USED
BY CABINET MINISTERS.  THE POLICE PLACED THE BOMB IN A NEARBY FLOWER BED,
WHERE IT WENT OFF.  THE SHOCK WAVE SHATTERED SOME WINDOWS IN GOVERNMENT
HOUSE AND STREET LAMPS IN THE PLAZA MURILLO.

PERLA] [TEXT] SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO HAS DESCRIBED
THE POSSIBLE RESUMPTION OF DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
REBELS AS POSITIVE.

   MERINO SAID THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
SHOULD NOT CLAIM CREDIT FOR THE RESUMPTION OF A DIALOGUE BECAUSE IT WAS
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WHO TOOK THE INITIATIVE IN RESUMING THE TALKS.
MERINO ADDED THAT THE REBELS SHOULD ABANDON THE DELAYING AND IRRESPONSIBLE
TACTICS REGARDING THE DIALOGUE BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS LOST CREDIBILITY BOTH IN
THE MILITARY SENSE AND IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE FMLN HAS LOST CREDIBILITY IN ALL OF ITS
ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MILITARY ACTIONS.  THE ONLY VALID ALTERNATIVE TO
PACIFY THE COUNTRY IS FOR THE REBELS TO STOP HOSTILITIES, VIOLENCE, AND
TERRORISM.  WE SHOULD JOINTLY EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES OF THEIR JOINING THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  [END RECORDING]

   HE ALSO SAID ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES READILY AVAILABLE TO THE FMLN IS TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS FOR DELEGATES TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PARLIAMENT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] EL SALVADOR HAS PROPOSED AT THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY TO RATIFY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT PROTOCOL.  THIS WOULD
OPEN THE DOOR FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTION OF THE SALVADORAN DELEGATES TO THE
PARLIAMENT.  IF A TRULY DEMOCRATIC WILLINGNESS BY THE FMLN EXISTS, THIS
COULD BE THEIR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE.  IT HAS NOT YET BEEN
DECIDED WHETHER THIS ELECTION WILL BE HELD BEFORE THE 1991 OFFICIAL
ELECTIONS FOR MAYORS AND DEPUTIES.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN COULD
JOINTLY CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF A SPECIAL ELECTION THIS YEAR.  THEN WE
COULD MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE 1991 CONSTITUTIONAL ELECTIONS. [END
RECORDING]

   REGARDING THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS, MERINO SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS
FAMILIAR WITH THE REBELS' TACTICS, PARTICULARLY WHEN TALKS ARE BEING
CONSIDERED.  HE ALSO SAID THE REBELS OPERATE IN CYCLES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER REACTED NAIVELY TO THE
FMLN TERRORISTS' STATEMENTS OR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE.  WE ARE
FULLY AWARE OF THEIR PLANS AND STRATEGIES.  THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, BEARS
THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING HARMONY AND THE CITIZENS'S SECURITY.

LARGEST MILITARY OPERATION IN THE PAST 10 YEARS, THE POSSIBILITY FOR A NEW
DIALOGUE HAS APPEARED IN EL SALVADOR ONCE MORE, CREATING EXPECTATIONS, BOTH
HERE AND ABROAD.  THE COMING MEETING OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI WITH UNITED
NATION'S REPRESENTATIVES, SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK, AND THE MEETING ON 12

OCHOA PEREZ TODAY SAID THAT THE MASTERMINDS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS'
MURDER ARE NOT "SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," BUT ARE "MUCH HIGHER IN THE
HIERARCHY."

   "REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS A GENERAL OR COLONEL, WHOEVER MASTERMINDED
THIS CRIME MUST BE PUNISHED," THE RANKING LEADER OF THE RULING ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY AND RETIRED OFFICER SAID DURING A
TELEVISED INTERVIEW. 

   THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MULTIPLE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE ON 16 NOVEMBER
"ARE NOT SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," HE SAID.

   "THIS ACTION INVOLVED MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OFFICERS, AND EVEN IF A GENERAL OR
COLONEL IS INVOLVED, (THE CULPRITS) MUST BE PUNISHED," HE POINTED OUT.

   HE ADDED: "WE HOPE THAT IT WILL NOT BE AS IN THE PAST WHEN THE MASTERMINDS
ARE PROTECTED.  AS THE SAYING GOES: THE LITTLE GUYS ALWAYS PAY."

   OCHOA SAID THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT "INVESTIGATIONS MUST BE PURSUED" AND
THAT NOBODY SHOULD RECEIVE "SPECIAL TREATMENT," BECAUSE "UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE ARE ELEMENTS WHO ARE HURTING THE ARMY AND THE PRESIDENT, AND THE HIGH
COMMAND HAVE TO PURGE THEM."

   OCHOA, FORMER DEPUTY AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE STATE POWER COMPANY,
DESCRIBED AS "COURAGEOUS" THE DECISION OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO
PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES MASSACRED THE SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN.

   ON 7 JANUARY, CRISTIANI OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL
KILLED THE JESUITS, THEIR COOK, AND THE COOK'S 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

   HOWEVER, HE REFUSED TO REVEAL THE NAMES OF THOSE INVOLVED TO AVOID
HAMPERING THE INVESTIGATION.

   THE COLONEL SAID: "WE HOPE THAT THE NAMES WILL BE REVEALED SOON AND THAT
THESE PEOPLE WILL BE PUNISHED."

   OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OCHOA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST AN INTERNAL
STRUGGLE WITHIN THE RULING ARENA, EXPRESS AN IMPLICIT WISH TO SEE THIS
ABOMINABLE CRIME RESOLVED."

   THE RETIRED COLONEL ADDED THAT THE "COURAGEOUS" POSITION OF CRISTIANI
REGARDING THIS CASE HAS BROUGHT HIM STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS
HELPING TO STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT
WANTS TO PROMOTE.

   ALTHOUGH OCHOA ADMITTED THAT IN EL SALVADOR MILITARY POWER HAS BEEN BEHIND
THE REAL POWER AND THAT TRYING A MILITARY MAN HAS BEEN TABOO, HE SAID THAT
CRISTIANI "IS DETERMINED TO INTENSIFY A PURGE OF SUCH ELEMENTS FROM THE
ARMED FORCES."

   HE ALSO ADMITTED "THAT THERE ARE STILL SALVADORAN MILITARY MEN WHO BELIEVE
THAT THEY HOLD POWER AND THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR RIFLES AND THE POWER THAT
THEIR WEAPONS GIVE THEM."

FINISHED OFF THE GUERRILLAS, ALONG CAME THE GREAT SURPRISES IN THE EAST
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHEN THEY BROUGHT DOWN WALLS WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO
MILITARY INVASIONS AND ATTAINED A DEMOCRATIC OPENING.  ENDING THE YEAR, THE
WORLD WAS SURPRISED WITH THE BRUTAL U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.

   NOW, WHEN THE LAST DECADE OF THE CENTURY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN, EL SALVADOR
ADDS ANOTHER PAGE TO THE BOOK OF LAST-MINUTE SURPRISES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI
HIMSELF--WHO, TOGETHER WITH ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, SAID HOURS AFTER THE
JESUITS AND THEIR MAIDS HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT THERE WERE SUSPICIONS THAT
THE FMLN COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE--HAS JUST ACCEPTED, ESPECIALLY
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE U.S. CONGRESS, THAT ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL WERE THE
ONES WHO MURDERED THE TOP BRAINS, THE BEST INTELLECTUALS OF EL SALVADOR.
THE MURDERERS WERE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND, AT LEAST ON THE NATIONAL
TELEVISON NETWORK, CRISTIANI PROMISED TO DISLOSE THEIR NAMES.  [PASSAGE
INDISTINCT]...THE JESUITS' MURDERS OR THE CANCELLATION OF AID.

   IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ARMY--WHICH MURDERED MONSIGNO OSCAR ROMERO, 1,000
PEASANTS IN EL MOZOTE, 70 INDIANS IN LAS HOJAS, HUNDREDS OF SALVADORANS IN
ZUNPU, AND UNIONISTS AT THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION
FEDERATION] OFFICES, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE ARMED FORCES' WELL-KNOWN
CRIMES--IS GOING TO BE PURGED AT LAST, IF THIS IS REALLY TRUE, THEN WE WOULD
HAVE TO SAY THAT A TRUE NEGOTIATION WILL START.  IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS
MADE PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR.  

   ONE OF OUR DEMANDS, A REALISTIC DEMAND TO PROPITIATE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR,
IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PURGE OF THE ARMY.  IN MEXCIO AND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA
RICA, WE SAID THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT ACCEPT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL, THE
NATION WOULD DO SO.  AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  THE NATION DEMANDS THAT
THE ARMED FORCES BE PURGED.

   THE MOST IMPORTANT U.S. NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSCASTS HAVE NOTED THE
IRREFUTABLE FACT THAT 10 YEARS OF U.S. ADVICE AND AN INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN
$3 BILLION--VERY CLOSE TO $4 BILLION--TO CREATE A HUGE BUILDUP IN THEIR
ARMAMENTS HAVE NOT SERVED TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF AN ARMY THAT MURDERED
MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS, INCLUDING NUNS AND U.S.
ADVISERS.  WE BELIEVE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD WAS MISTAKEN WHEN
HE SAID THAT U.S. AID IN ITSELF WAS NOT BEING DISCUSSED.  THE 10 YEARS OF
AID, ADVICE, AND U.S. STRATEGY IN EL SALVADOR HAVE PROVEN TO BE A FAILURE.
IF THE UNITED STATES HAS ANY INTENTIONS OF CONTRIBUTING TO PEACE, NOW IS THE
TIME TO CHANGE ITS POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR.

   EVENTS HAVE PLACED THE ISSUE OF THE CONTINUATION OF AID TO EL SALVADOR ON
THE CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES.  THE AID WAS MADE CONDITIONAL ON PUNISHMENT
FOR THE JESUITS' MURDERS.  BUT WHAT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY?  IT IS A
DECISION THAT GOES BEYOND A BASIC DEMAND FOR JUSTICE.  IT WILL DETERMINE THE
CONTINUATION OF U.S. AID.  IT ENTAILS THE DECISION TO TURN THEIR POLICY
AROUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE TO
DISCUSS WHETHER CONGRESS' POSITION IS TO BE: ONE, WE APPROVE THE PURGE OF
THE ARMY AND THUS WE WILL GIVE THEM MORE AID, OR, TWO, WE APPROVE THE PURGE
AS A CONCRETE STEP TO DEMOCRATIZATION AND WILL SUSPEND MILITARY AID SO THAT
THESE CONDITIONS CAN BE USED TO REACH A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   WILL U.S. CONGRESSMEN BE CAPABLE OF SURPRISING THE WORLD BY HELPING THE
SALVADORANS TO TOPPLE THE FASCIST WALL, THE WALL OF WAR?  WILL THEY DO THIS
BY STOPPING MILITARY AID?  THE FMLN HAS SAID CLEARLY THAT IF THE UNITED
STATES STOPS AID TO THE ARMY IT WILL CORRESPOND WITH ACTIONS TO REACH A
COMPLETE HALT IN HOSTILITIES.  WE HOPE THE U.S. CONGRESS DOES NOT MAKE A
MISTAKE.  IF IT STOPS AID, IF IT CUTS IT, IF IT ENDS IT, WE WILL STAND
BEFORE A CLEAR AND HOPEFUL SIGN FOR PEACE.  HOWEVER, IF NOT, WE WILL STAND
BEFORE YET ANOTHER SIGN OF WAR, AND THE SURPRISE WILL NOT BE A GOOD ONE.

SALVADORAN POLITICAL LEADER HECTOR OQUELI, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED IN GUATEMALA,
WAS FOUND DEAD.

   OQUELI'S BODY WAS FOUND NEXT TO THE BODY OF GUATEMALAN POLITICIAN GILDA
FLORES, WHO WAS TAKING HIM TO THIS CITY'S AIRPORT SO THAT OQUELI COULD
TRAVEL TO NICARAGUA.

   SOLORZANO MARTINEZ TOLD NOTIMEX THAT , BECAUSE OF THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
OQUELI WAS IN GUATEMALA--LESS THAN 24 HOURS--THE ONLY EXPLANATION IS THAT
THERE ARE GROUPS LINKED TO THE SALVADORAN PARAMILITARY SQUADRONS IN THE

   CLANDESTINE, 13 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT]
REGARDING THE ASSASSINATION OF HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE AND
SECRETARY FOR LATIN AMERICA OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, IN
GUATEMALA ON 12 JANUARY, WE STATE:

   1. WE BLAME ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], THE REGIME OF
[PRESIDENT ALFREDO] CRISTIANI AND [ARENA LEADER ROBERTO] D'AUBUISSON, AND
ITS ARMED FORCES FOR THIS DETESTABLE ASSASSINATION.  THE LINKS BETWEEN
D'AUBUISSON'S ARENA PARTY AND THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT OF
MARIO SANDOVAL ARE WELL KNOWN.  BOTH OPPOSE EVERY EFFORT TO BRING PEACE TO
THE REGION.

   2. THIS NEW CRIME AND THE RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE CASE OF THE
JESUITS, WHICH SHOW THAT THE MASTERMINDS WILL NOT BE PUNISHED, FORCES US TO
REVIEW OUR DIALOGUE OFFER BECAUSE WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING THE
FASCIST REGIME WASH ITS FACE TO OBTAIN U.S. MILITARY AID AND TO PROCEED WITH
ITS PLAN TO ANNIHILATE EVERY TYPE OF OPPOSITION.

   3. THE ASSASSINATION OF DR OQUELI AND HIS COMPANION, GILDA FLORES, THE
EXTENSION OF THE STATE OF THE SIEGE, AND THE FACT THAT NOTHING INDICATES
THAT THERE WILL BE PUNISHMENT FOR THE MASTERMINDS OF THE MASSACRE OF 16
NOVEMBER SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE
LATTER CASE IS ONLY A FARCE TO OBTAIN U.S. AID AND TO PROCEED WITH THE
SLAUGHTER OF OPPOSITION MEMBERS.

   4. AS THOSE EVENTS SHOW, THE POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFICT REQUIRES A
PURGE OF THE ARMED FORCES, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THERE
CAN BE NO DIALOGUE AMID STATE TERRORISM, A STATE OF SIEGE, AND GENERAL
TRAMPLING ON HUMAN RIGHTS.  UNDER THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE REGIME GIVES
ITSELF THE RIGHT TO CARRY OUT A GENERAL REPRESSION.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON
ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO STRUGGLE FOR ITS ABROGATION.

   5. THE 15 DECEMBER 1989 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION DEMANDING RESPECT
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS MUST BE UNCONDITIONALLY IMPLEMENTED
IN OUR COUNTRY TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE AND CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO A
POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) TODAY DEMANDED THAT GUATEMALAN
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO "THOROUGHLY" INVESTIGATE THE ASSASSINATION OF MNR
LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND OF GUATEMALAN ATTORNEY GILDA FLORES.

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE MNR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CONDEMNED THE
"ABOMINABLE" CRIME PERPETRATED ON 12 JANUARY IN GUATEMALA BY ARMED MEN
WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES.  THE MNR ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF MNR SECRETARY GENERAL GUILLERMO UNGO,
WHO WILL ARRIVE IN EL SALVADOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO ATTEND OQUELI'S
FUNERAL, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR 15 JANUARY.

   OQUELI, 45, AND GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY
(PSD) OF GUATEMALA, WERE KIDNAPPED WHILE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO LA AURORA
AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY.  THEIR BODIES WERE FOUND LATER AT A PLACE NEAR
THE SALVADORAN BORDER.

   "THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSASSINATION ARE THE
ETERNAL ENEMIES OF LIBERTY, PEACE, AND DEMOCRACY," THE MNR STATES.  THE MNR,
ALONG WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S
MOVEMENT [MPSC], MAKE UP THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE COALITION.

   THE MPSC ALSO ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE DEPLORING THE ASSASSINATION OF OQUELI
AND URGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN THIS ACTION.

   CLANDESTINE, 13 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] WHAT WE HAD PREDICTED HAS OCCURRED.  CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THIS
AFTERNOON THAT A COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, ONE SECOND LIEUTENANT, TWO
SECOND SERGEANTS, AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE OF
THE JESUITS.

   THE ACCUSATION AGAINST COLONEL BENAVIDES IS THE FOLLOWING: THAT THE
MULTIPLE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN THE SECTOR UNDER HIS COMMAND.  FROM THE
LIEUTENANT ON DOWN, THE ACCUSATION IS THAT THEY DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE
CRIME.  [WORDS INDISTINCT], AS CRISTIANI SAID, THAT IT WAS COL BENAVIDES,
BUT IT WAS NOT COL BENAVIDES WHO ISSUED THE ORDER.  SO, THE QUESTION IS: WHO
GAVE THE ORDER TO KILL THE JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS.  IN OUR VIEW, COL
BENAVIDES WAS IMPLICATED SOLELY AS A MEANS OF PROPAGANDA AIMED AT THE U.S.
CONGRESS.  IT IS CLEAR THAT COL BENAVIDES DID NOT GIVE THE ORDER.  HE
PROBABLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE ACTION.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT
WE KNOW ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.  FIRST, HE IS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE CARRIED OUT
ACTS OF REPRESSION OR CORRUPTION.  OUR REPORT INDICATES THAT BENAVIDES HAS
   MAINTAINED A POSITION IN FAVOR OF INSTITUTIONS AND OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS.
HE WAS DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE, STUDIOUS AND NOT REPRESSIVE CADET, ONE OF THE
FEW EXCEPTIONS IN LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1977 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE
CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].  IN OTHER WORDS, FOR THE
LA TANDONA, A GANG OF ASSASSINS, HE IS A PERFECT SCAPEGOAT.

   THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUITS WAS NOT A PERSONAL DECISION.  IT WAS PART OF
THE ARMED FORCES' COUNTEROFFENSIVE ACTIONS DURING THE NOVEMBER BATTLES.  IT
WAS A COLD-BLOODED, PREMEDITATED PLAN EXECUTED TO DECAPITATE THE PEOPLE'S
MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION.  LET US REMEMBER THE THREATS AGAINST
FATHER ELLACURIA OVER THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK PRIOR TO THE
ASSASSINATION.  LET US REMEMBER THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 15 NOVEMBER AND
EARLY MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SEVERAL OFFICES OF LABOR UNIONS AND HOUSES OF
OPPOSITION MEMBERS WERE ATTACKED.  LET US REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE MASSSACRE
OF THE JESUITS, THE OFFICERS SHOUTED OVER LOUDSPEAKERS THAT THEY HAD KILLED
ELLACURIA AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE KILLING COMMUNISTS.  THE
BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS.

   IN OUR VIEW, THE ASSASSINS OF THE JESUITS WERE THOSE WHO APPEARED ON THE
RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK MAKING KNOWN THE RESULTS OF THE SO-CALLED HONOR
COMMISSION.  COL BENAVIDES WILL PROBABLY BE FREED IN A SHORT TIME AND BE
APPOINTED TO SOME POST ABROAD, OR HE MIGHT EXPERIENCE THE SAME FATE AS THAT
OF CAPTAIN EDUARDO ALFONSO AVILA, WHO WENT IN AND OUT OF JAIL EACH TIME THAT
MILITARY AID FOR EL SALVADOR WAS DISCUSSED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS.

   HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE AND AS HAS ALWAYS OCCURRED, IT WILL BE THE
LIEUTENANTS, THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND THE SOLDIERS WHO CARRIED OUT
AN ORDER WHO WILL PAY THE CONSEQUENCES.  WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN
THE CASES OF THE NUNS WHEN [WORDS INDISTINCT] A FEW SOLDIERS, THE MASSACRE
OF SAN FRANCISCO, AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE U.S. ADVISERS AND RODOLFO
VIERA.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] ONCE AGAIN THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE FRUSTRATED, AS
HAS HAPPENED IN SO MANY OTHER CASES.

   THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS AGAIN CONFIRMS THAT TO, AS CRISTIANI
SAID, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, WE HAVE TO OBTAIN DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND
SELF-DETERMINATION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THE NEW FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] PROPOSAL TO STOP FIGHTING PROVIDED THE U.S. CONGRESS
SUSPENDS AID TO EL SALVADOR IS BLACKMAIL.  WITH THIS, HE SAID, THE FMLN IS
SHOWING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT ITS MEMBERS ARE PLAIN TERRORISTS.

   THIS WAS SAID ON 12 JANUARY BY THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
PRESIDENT DR ARMANDO CALDERON SOL, WHO MAINTAINED THAT ASPIRATIONS OF THE
SUBSERSIVES ARE "DETESTABLE," AND, THEREFORE, CANNOT BE ACCEPTED.

   THE PROMINENT POLITICAL LEADER SAID THAT WHILE IN EAST EUROPE THERE IS A
TRUE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION, THE FMLN MAINTAINS ITS POSITION OF TRYING TO
SUBDUE THE PEOPLE WITH A TOTALITARIAN PLAN THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS.  "HISTORY
HAS LEFT THEM BEHIND AND THEY (THE TERRORISTS) HAVE NOT NOTICED IT," HE
ADDED.

   CALDERON SOL EMPHASIZED THAT FMLN LEADERS SHOULD RECONSIDER THE POSITION
THEY HAVE MAINTAINED AND SHOULD RESPECT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE WITHOUT
IT, NO NATION CAN ACHIEVE HARMONY AND DEVELOPMENT.

   THE SEDITIOUS "SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE ALONE AND THAT NO ONE
SUPPORTS THEIR ANARCHIC PLAN," THE ARENA PRESIDENT ADDED.  HE RECALLED THAT
DURING THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPORTED THE
ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN NEVER RECEIVED ANY SUPPORT.

   CALDERON SOL STRESSED THAT THE FMLN MUST PROVIDE REAL PROOF THAT IT WANTS
TO REACH PEACE THROUGH NEGOTIATED MEANS, BECAUSE PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS GOOD
INTENTIONS AND WANTS TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THROUGH TALKS.

   THE SUBVERSIVES MUST SUSPEND THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT BE AT THE
NEGOTIATING TABLE WHILE THE FMLN AT THE SAME TIME IS PREPARING AN OFFENSIVE.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 13 JAN 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GUATEMALAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY CONDEMNED TODAY THE ASSASSINATION OF LEFTIST SALVADORAN LEADER
HECTOR OQUELI AND GUATEMALAN POLITICAL LEADER GILDA FLORES.

   BOTH BODIES WERE FOUND TODAY IN AN AREA NEAR GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR
BORDER AFTER THE VICTIMS WERE KIDNAPPED IN GUATEMALA CITY YESTERDAY.

   A FOREIGN MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE "REGRETS AND CONDEMNS" THE ASSASSINATION OF
OQUELI, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL FOR LATIN AMERICA
AND THE CARIBBEAN, AND DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR), A LEFTIST MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR.

   "WE DEEPLY REGRET THE DEATHS OF TWO VALUABLE PERSONS, AND WE CONDEMN THIS
ACT OF VIOLENCE," THE NOTE ADDS.

   THE DOCUMENT IS THE FIRST OFFICIAL REACTION TO THE KIDNAPPING AND
ASSASSINATION OF BOTH LEADERS.

   GILDA FLORES WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY (PSD)
OF GUATEMALA, WHOSE SECRETARY GENERAL MARIO SOLORZANO REPORTED THAT
"SALVADORAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS" ARE CARRYING OUT ACTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.

   ACCORDING TO SOLORZANO, THE INCIDENT "SHOWS THERE IS COOPERATION BETWEEN
PARAMILITARY GROUPS OF BOTH COUNTRIES," BECAUSE THE PERPETRATORS KNEW OF
OQUELI'S ARRIVAL "AND THEY STAGED AN ENTIRE OPERATION TO KIDNAP HIM."

   THE BODIES OF THE POLITICAL LEADERS WERE FOUND EARLY THIS MORNING WITH
SHOTS THROUGH THE TEMPLE IN THE GUATEMALAN TOWN OF JALPATAGUA, NEAR THE
BORDER WITH EL SALVADOR, OQUELI'S RELATIVES TOLD EFE IN EL SALVADOR.

   OQUELI ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA LAST THURSDAY.  ON FRIDAY MORNING, WHILE ON
HIS WAY TO LA AURORA AIRPORT TO CATCH A PLANE TO NICARAGUA, HE WAS KIDNAPPED
BY "HEAVILY ARMED MEN," ACCORDING TO THE MNR.

CARLOS MORALES SAID TODAY THAT A "FOREIGN COMMANDO" KILLED HECTOR OQUELI,
LEADER OF THE SALVADORAN LEFTIST PARTY NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT
(MNR), AND GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER GILDA FLORES IN GUATEMALA.

   MORALES SAID AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS
THAT THE INTENTION OF THE "TERRORIST COMMANDO" WAS CAPTURING OQUELI ALIVE TO
TAKE HIM TO EL SALVADOR BUT THAT "SOMETHING MADE THEM CHANGE THEIR PLANS."

   MORALES STRESSED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE "FOREIGN COMMANDO," THE
NATIONALITY AND ORIGIN OF WHOM HE DID NOT SPECIFY, HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR
MONTHS, ADDING THAT "IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY TERRORIST ATTACKS."

   MORALES SAID THAT THE GROUP HAS KILLED SEVERAL PEOPLE AND HAS CARRIED OUT
VARIOUS BOMB ATTACKS IN GUATEMALA.  ASKED ABOUT A STATEMENT BY SOCIAL
DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER MARIO SOLORZANO, WHO SAID THAT SALVADORAN AND
GUATEMALAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS OPERATE JOINTLY IN GUATEMALA, MORALES SAID
THAT "THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION."

   "WE CANNOT SAY WHAT COUNTRY THIS TERRORIST COMMANDO CAME FROM; HOWEVER, WE
HAVE ALREADY TAKEN MEASURES TO COUNTER ITS ACTIVITIES IN OUR NATIONAL
TERRITORY," HE STRESSED.

   OUR GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LET THIS GROUP "DEFAME" GUATEMALA WITH ITS
ACTIVITIES.  THERE IS ALREADY A SPECIAL UNIT WITHIN THE SECURITY FORCES IN
CHARGE OF LOCATING THE KILLERS OF OQUELI AND FLORES.

   ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL REPORTS RECEIVED BY THE POLICE, THE KIDNAPPING
TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY WHEN OQUELI AND FLORES WERE HEADING TO LA AURORA
AIRPORT IN THIS CAPITAL.

   THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELING, WHICH WAS FOUND NEAR THE
AIRPORT, WAS INTERCEPTED BY ANOTHER CAR, WHOSE OCCUPANTS FORCED GILDA FLORES
OUT OF THE CAR WHILE OQUELI TRIED TO ESCAPE, MORALES SAID.

   SAN SALVADOR, 15 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] ARMANDO CALDERON SOL,
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA), THE RULING
SALVADORAN PARTY, TODAY CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO ANY POSSIBLE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MILITARY PERSONNEL IMPLICATED IN THE ASSASSINATION
OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.

   "IT IS SOMETHING SO HORRENDOUS, SO MONSTROUS, THAT WE MUST INVESTIGATE THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) STAGED
THIS ASSASSINATION TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT," CALDERON SOL SAID.

   SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI IMPLICATED FOUR OFFICERS, INCLUDING
ONE COLONEL, AND FIVE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN THE ASSASSINATION OF
SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY.

   ACCORDING TO CALDERON SOL, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT "IS DUTYBOUND TO
UNCOVER THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS AND TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY LINK BETWEEN
THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED AND THE FMLN."

   "THOSE RESPONSIBLE ACTED ON THEIR OWN, TO CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THE CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT AND DISCREDIT IT.  IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE AN ISOLATED ACT.
INVESTIGATIONS ARE POINTING TO SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY," THE PRESIDENT OF
THE RIGHTIST ARENA PARTY SAID.

   IN ADDITION, CALDERON SOL ASKED THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND
GUATEMALA TO CARRY OUT AN "EXHAUSTIVE" INVESTIGATION TO ENSURE THAT THE
MURDER OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES "DOES NOT GO
UNPUNISHED."

   CALDERON NOTED THAT "OQUELI HAD CLEARLY RENOUNCED THE POSITION OF ARMED
STRUGGLE IN FAVOR OF A PROGRAM FOR DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION."

   OQUELI COLINDRES, A SALVADORAN LEADER OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, WAS
FOUND DEAD ALONG WITH GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIAL
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, ON 13 JANUARY IN A TOWN IN SOUTHEASTERN GUATEMALA NEAR THE

   TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA BY JULIO
ARMANDO VALDES] [EXCERPT] [AZCONA] ...WHICH HAS DISMAYED ALL HONDURAN
PEOPLE.  THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS KIND OF ACTION--THE MURDER
OF [RETIRED] GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ--WHICH WAS POLITICALLY
MOTIVATED AND PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS, AND WHICH, I BELIEVE, DESERVES
THE DENUNCIATION OF ALL HONDURANS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WILL THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES ADOPT ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES?

   [AZCONA] YES, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT SOON.  I HAVE A MEETING
SCHEDULED WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ALSO BE
ATTENDED BY THE THREE PRESIDENTS OF THE STATE BRANCHES.  I MEAN, THE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] WILL CHAIR THE MEETING, AND NATIONAL CONGRESS
PRESIDENT CARLOS ARBIN MONTOYA AND SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT SALOMON
JIMENEZ CASTRO WILL ALSO ATTEND.  WE HAVE ALSO INVITED THE CANDIDATES
OF THE TWO [NUMBER AS HEARD] PARTIES TO THIS MEETING SINCE ONE OF THEM
IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT HONDURAN PRESIDENT.  WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH SOME
GUIDELINE--SOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED--NOT JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF
OUR TERM BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE FARSIGHTED
AND NOT JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE SHORT TERM, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY COMMON
IN HONDURAS, WHERE WE LOOK AND FIND SOLUTIONS ONLY FOR THE PRESENT.
WE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS JOINTLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THE LONG RUN,
WHICH INCLUDES THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE.  WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE
OURS, WHICH IS A VERY COMPLETE DEMOCRACY.  IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE
INTERNAL ELECTIONS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES, WHERE CITIZENS ENJOY FULL
RIGHTS, WHERE PARTIES AND PARTY LEADERS CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE, WHERE
WE HAVE TRUE, CLEAN, AND HONEST ELECTIONS, WHERE WE HAVE A NATIONAL
ELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY NOR CAN IT BE
INFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHERE THE STATE BRANCHES ARE TOTALLY
INDEPENDENT.

   ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE HONDURAS A DEMOCRACY, AND EVERY
SECTOR OF HONDURAN SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THEM BY AVOIDING
VIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS, OBEYING THE LAW, AND CONDEMNING AND ATTACKING
EXTREME TERRORIST GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION, THUS ENABLING US
TO CONSOLIDATE OUR DEMOCRACY AND REACH THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT
ATTAINED BY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.

   IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WORLDWIDE THAT PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN
ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DEMOCRACY.  THE FRG, THE MEDITERRANEAN
COUNTRIES--ITALY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN--ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS, AND THERE IS
THE CASE OF JAPAN, WHICH HAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND HAS ACHIEVED
EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT.  TAIWAN IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE.  AT
THIS STAGE...

   [VALDES, INTERRUPTING] YES, BUT THIS TAKES TIME.

   [AZCONA] YES.  AT THIS STAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT
THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF
DEVELOPMENT.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT
THAT WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ENOUGH.  EACH ONE OF US, EACH SECTOR, MUST
DO HIS PART TO MAKE IT WORK.

   WHEN I MENTION SECTORS, I AM REFERRING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WHICH
MUST BE GENEROUS, EXHIBIT CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND SHOW MUCH
INITIATIVE; TO ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS, WHICH MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS
WITHOUT FOMENTING STRIKES AND OTHER DISORDERS, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT
ABOUT ILLEGALLY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORMAL LEGAL PROCEDURES; TO
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY,
BECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS MUST COMPLY WITH THEIR DUTIES; AND THE SAME GOES FOR
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.

   IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS OR THE NEXT
GOVERNMENT ALONE.  OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE TRANSITORY AND THEIR POWER IS
RELATIVE.  I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES.  THERE IS NO POINT IN LASHING OUT
AT THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE POWER IN HONDURAS IS RELATIVE AND CONDITIONAL.
WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TOWARD HONDURAS'
DEVELOPMENT.  THIS SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF PUBLIC
EMPLOYEES, BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND ORGANIZED PEASANTS, BUT ALL HONDURANS
SHOULD CONTRIBUTE.  THAT IS WHAT COUNTS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WHEN WILL THIS MEETING BE HELD AND WHAT IMMEDIATE
MEASURES WILL YOU PROPOSE?

   [AZCONA] THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO
INVESTIGATE THE LATEST CRIME, WHICH WAS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE LIKE A
ROBBERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.  THIS CRIME WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED.  IT
WAS A TERRORIST ACT PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE DEATH
PENALTY MIGHT BE A WAY TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.  WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS?

   [AZCONA] I RECENTLY READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IN A MEXICAN
MAGAZINE.  THE DEATH PENALTY IS OPPOSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND HAS
BEEN ABOLISHED IN HONDURAS.  I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION HERE
BECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS NOT SOLVED THE CRIME PROBLEM ANYWHERE ELSE IN
THE WORLD.  FOR INSTANCE, THIS PENALTY EXISTS IN MANY U.S. STATES, BUT THIS
HAS NOT DETERRED CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING TERRIBLE CRIMES.  PEOPLE HAVE
LOST CONTROL.  WHEN CRIMINALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, NOT
EVEN THE DEATH PENALTY CAN STOP THEM.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRIMES, SUCH AS
DRUG TRAFFICKING, FOR WHICH NO BAIL SHOULD BE PERMITTED.  I THINK A BILL
THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE PASSED BY
THE CONGRESS.  OF COURSE, IT WILL BE APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT SO THOSE
FOUND GUILTY OF THIS CRIME CANNOT BE BAILED OUT.  IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE
AUTHORITIES TO ARREST A DRUG TRAFFICKER ONLY TO SEE HIM RELEASED ON BAIL
BY A JUDGE WHO HAS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ABIDE BY THE LAW.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, THE FAR RIGHTIST GROUP AAA [ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION
ALLIANCE], THROUGH A LOCAL RADIO STATION, WARNED THAT THEY WILL TAKE
REVENGE ON MAJOR COMMUNIST LEADERS, SUCH AS JORGE ARTURO REINA, RAMON
CUSTODIO, AND OTHERS.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

   [AZCONA] I AM ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF REVENGE BECAUSE IT WOULD
ONLY LEAD TO ESCALATED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS.  I CONDEMN THIS
ATTITUDE IN VIEW OF THE REGRETTABLE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ
MARTINEZ.  AS FAR AS THE DEATH PENALTY GOES, IT WILL NOT BE A SOLUTION TO
THE CRIME PROBLEM.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, CIVIC COMMITTEES HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN THE
COUNTRY.

   [AZCONA] I AGREE, BUT THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE
AUTHORITIES.  A CIVIC COMMITTEE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IS ONE THING, BUT IT
IS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO SUE THESE COMMITTEES TO PERFORM DUTIES THAT ARE
ALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE ARMED FORCES.

   [VALDES] WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES MEET?

   [AZCONA] THEY WILL MEET WHEN I RETURN FROM CARACAS.

   LA PAZ, 24 DEC 88 -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO A CLAIM MADE BY THE MINISTER OF
INTERIOR, MIGRATION, AND JUSTICE, JUAN CARLOS DURAN, 1988 WAS A "POSITIVE
YEAR," BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO SCORE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE ECONOMIC
AREA AS WELL AS IN DEFENSE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM EXISTING IN BOLIVIA.

   THE MINISTER REMARKED:  "I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A YEAR OF FULL
ACCOMPLISHMENT, A VERY POSITIVE AND VERY GOOD YEAR"; HE ADDED THAT THE
MONTHS OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR REPRESENTED PROGRESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT
IN STATE ADMINISTRATION TASKS.

   HE EXPLAINED THAT GREATER CONSOLIDATION WAS ACHIEVED IN THE ECONOMIC
AREA, MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE EFFORTS INTENDED TO REINFORCE BOLIVIA'S
POLITICAL SYSTEM TO BE WELL AIMED.

   HE CLAIMED THAT A SYSTEM SUCH AS THE ONE IN FORCE IN OUR NATION HAS
ENABLED THE CITIZENS TO ENJOY "ABSOLUTE FREEDOM," SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN
UNDERSCORED NOT ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT IN THE NATIONS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD
AS WELL.

   HE NOTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT HAD TO RESORT TO ANY UNUSUAL
ACTION TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.  HE RECALLED MARTIAL LAW HAD NOT BEEN ORDERED,
ATTESTING TO PROGRESS IN THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

   HE COMMENTED:  "BOLIVIA IS AN EXEMPLARY COUNTRY IN TERMS OF FREEDOM,"
STRESSING THE BENEFITS THIS NATION HAS EXPERIENCED BY HAVING A DEMOCRATIC
SYSTEM IN WHICH EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISAGREE EVEN WITH THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

   HE SAID THAT THE CITIZENS AS A WHOLE HAVE FOUND IT NECESSARY FOR RIGHTS
TO BE RECOGNIZED AND OBLIGATIONS ACCEPTED.  FOR THIS REASON, HE CLAIMED,
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE STABILITY IN THE
VARIOUS FIELDS OF ACTIVITY, SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE FAR MORE VISIBLE
EFFECTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

DRUG TRAFFICKING

   WITH REGARD TO THE BATTLE AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFIC, HE CITED THE WORK
PERFORMED BY THE SPECIAL FORCES TO BATTLE DRUG TRAFFICKING WHICH, ACCORDING
TO HIS ACCOUNT, DESTROYED HUNDRED OF COCAINE FACTORIES AND PROCESSING PITS,
IN ADDITION TO CONFISCATING DRUGS AND ARRESTING PERSONS LINKED WITH THEIR
PRODUCTION OR ILLICIT TRAFFICKING.

   HE DECLARED THAT, DESPITE ITS ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS,
BOLIVIA HAS MANAGED TO RESPOND TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND TO
FOSTER A CONSCIOUSNESS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE METHODS FOR COMBATING DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.

ROBBERY

   THE MINISTER ANNOUNCED THAT THE SANTA CRUZ POLICE HAD MOBILIZED IN A
"COMBING OPERATION," TO FIND THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ROBBERY OF A CAR ON
THE TRACK OF THE EASTERN RAILROAD SYSTEM FROM WHICH 130,000 BOLIVIANOS,
INTENDED TO PAY CHRISTMAS BONUSES, WAS STOLEN.

   HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND POLICE WERE STILL COMPLYING WITH
INSTRUCTIONS TO ERADICATE THE CRIME THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING ON A LARGE
SCALE DURING RECENT MONTHS IN THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ, AND TO BENEFIT THE
EASTERN POPULATION WITH PROTECTION.

   HE EXPLAINED THAT THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TAKING STATEMENTS FROM
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE SEEN THE HOLDUP MEN AT CLOSE RANGE, SO AS TO
CAPTURE THEM PROMPTLY.

ORLANDO LETELIER OVER TO AN INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF JURISTS.

   THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE BY FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ, WHO
ADDED THAT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT IS HANDLING THE SITUATION IN A SERIOUS

SPOKESMAN LAST MONDAY IN REFERRING TO THIS MATTER REPRESENT A DISTORTED AND
PARTIAL VIEW, REFLECTING THE DESIRE TO IMPOSE A POSITION DISREGARDING
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

COURTS ARE PROCESSING A ROGATORY LETTER SUBMITTED THROUGH NORMAL DIPLOMATIC
CHANNELS, HAVING TO DO WITH THE PROCEEDINGS BEING CARRIED OUT IN THE UNITED

PERSONS NEAR RIO BLANCO MUNICIPALITY, TOLIMA DEPARTMENT.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT CRISTOBAL PEREZ AND RUBEN DARIO RAMIREZ WERE SHOT TO

   SO FAR THIS YEAR, 12 MEMBERS OF THE UP, THE LARGEST LEFTIST POLITICAL
FORCE IN COLOMBIA, HAVE BEEN KILLED BY RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS.

   AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM THE AIRPORT ON SATURDAY NIGHT, BERNARDO
JARAMILLO RECEIVED ANOTHER DEATH THREAT OVER THE TELEPHONE.  TODAY,
FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE THREAT, THE AUTHORITIES
STEPPED UP SECURITY MEASURES FOR JARAMILLO.  AN ARMORED VEHICLE, 2 STATION

   [JARAMILLO] I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT ONLY BAD PEOPLE ARE AFRAID.
HOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU QUITE HONESTLY THAT I WOULD BE MORE AFRAID IF I
HAD DECIDED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  I AM DETERMINED TO REMAIN IN COLOMBIA
AND TO CONTINUE WORKING FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.

   [GUTIERREZ] DO YOU FEEL THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING YOU ENOUGH
PROTECTION?

   [JARAMILLO] ONE THING IS THE DIRECT PROTECTION EFFICIENTLY PROVIDED BY
THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, AND ANOTHER THING IS THE
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY FOR ELIMINATING THESE PROBLEMS.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY FOR DISMANTLING THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS IS APPROPRIATE.

   [GUTIERREZ] WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR HOME, DO YOU FEEL IT IS YOUR LAST DAY?

   [JARAMILLO] I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTIMIST; I ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU
WILL DIE WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT.  WHEN I WALK OUT OF MY HOME, I TAKE ALL
THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS. [END RECORDING]

   JARAMILLO SAID HIS TWO SONS, WHO DO NOT LIVE IN BOGOTA, CALLED TO SAY

AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH IT AND, AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS, DETERMINE THE
VALIDITY OF THE EVIDENCE. [END RECORDING]

   NEVERTHELESS, MSGR ROMERO'S CASE HAS BEGUN TO HAVE THE ELEMENTS IT HAD
LACKED FOR MORE THAN 8 YEARS.  THE LEGAL EVIDENCE MUST CONTAIN A SERIES OF
CONDITIONS, AND ONLY THE JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE VALUE OR
NOT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE VIDEO
FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT EVIDENCE.  THE CONTENTS OF THE VIDEO MUST BE REAFFIRMED
BY THE PERSONS WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PARTICIPATED IN THE PREPARATION,
AND THE ACCURACY OF THE CONTENTS NARRATED IN THAT VIDEO MUST BE LEGALLY
DETERMINED. [END RECORDING]

   GARCIA ALVARADO ADDED THAT THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE DECIDED A FEW
HOURS AGO TO SUMMON FORMER ATTORNEY ROBERTO GIRON FLORES AND THE OFFICIALS
JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA AND GERARDO LE CHEVALIER TO GIVE THE EVIDENCE THEY
CLAIM TO HAVE ON THE CASE.  BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFICIALS, THE LATTER TWO MUST
MAKE SWORN STATEMENTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE JUDGE
IN CHARGE OF THE CASE HAS ISSUED RESOLUTIONS ORDERING THE SUMMONS OF IVON
FLORES AND SWORN STATEMENTS FROM THE TWO OFFICIALS MENTIONED. [END
RECORDING]

   THESE NEW RESOLUTIONS OF THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ON MSGR
ROMERO'S CASE WERE ISSUED AT THE REQUEST OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,
WHICH DEMONSTRATES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, THAT HE IS NOT AN
UNDERTAKER OF TRIALS, MUCH LESS OF PEOPLE.

   VICE PRESIDENT ANTONIO CASTILLO CLARAMOUNT SAID THE SUPREME COURT OF
JUSTICE HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO PUNISH THE MURDERERS OF MSGR ROMERO,
INCLUDING MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON.  THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO INSISTED THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT THOSE GUILTY OF THE
MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO BE PUNISHED.  HOWEVER, HE STRESSED THE SUPREME COURT
MUST ACT.  HE SAID THE INVESTIGATION MUST CONTINUE AND GATHER ALL THE
EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THIS CASE, WHICH OCCURRED IN MARCH 1980.

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 FEB 89 -- [TEXT] JUSTICE MINISTER JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA
SAID TODAY ALL THE EVIDENCE GATHERED BY THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
COMMISSION DEMONSTRATES THAT DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF
THE MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO.

   IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION,
DR JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA REPORTED TODAY IN DETAIL ON THE MURDER OF MSGR
OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.  DR SAMAYOA SAID TO CLARIFY THE CASE, THE COMMISSION
HAS CONDUCTED 238 MEETINGS, OVER 100 INQUIRIES, AND 21 DEPOSITIONS.  HE
ADDED THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE NAME OF "OPERATION
PINEAPPLE" AND THAT IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON WAS THE
MASTERMIND AND DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SAMAYOA] THERE IS NO DOUBT.  ALL THE INVESTIGATIONS
CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMISSION POINT TO MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON AS THE
MASTERMIND.  THIS HAS TO BE PROVEN IN COURT.  HOWEVER, HE HAS PARLIAMENTARY
IMMUNITY; HE CANNOT BE BROUGHT TO COURT.  THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE [ARENA] HAS THE MAJORITY IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND ARENA IS
NOT GOING TO PERMIT A DECLARATION THAT WILL BRING HIS CASE TO COURT. [END
RECORDING]

   DR SAMAYOA ALSO SAID HE IS WILLING TO PRESENT ALL THE EVIDENCE HE HAS
ON THE CASE.  HOWEVER, HE SAID HE DID NOT TRUST THE BEHAVIOR OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SAMAYOA] WE WILL PRESENT THE EVIDENCE.  I THINK THEY
ARE GOING TO BE SORRY THEY MADE THAT REQUEST, BECAUSE MANY PERSONS ARE
INVOLVED.  SINCE THEIR PARTICIPATION HAS NOT YET BEEN PROVEN, THESE NAMES
HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED.  HOWEVER, WHEN WE PRESENT THE ENTIRE DOSSIER TO
THE COURTS, THESE NAMES ARE GOING TO COME UP.  THEN SOME WILL JUDGE AND
DECIDE IF THEY PARTICIPATED OR NOT.  BUT THEIR NAMES ARE THERE, AS ARE
THEIR ACTIVITIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO THE DEATH SQUADS.  MANY
PERSONS WHO ARE MENTIONED ARE APPARENTLY RESPECTABLE, AND I MEAN
RESPECTABLE IN QUOTES.  [END RECORDING]

   THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO TOOK PLACE ON 24 MARCH
1980; ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL, THE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE TAKEN 9 YEARS
BECAUSE MANY PERSONS CONSIDERED KEY WITNESSES HAVE DIED SINCE THE TIME OF
THE MURDER.  HOWEVER, HE ADDED, WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE FBI AS WELL AS
SOME CENTRAL AMERICAN INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATIONS, THE CASE HAS BEEN
CLARIFIED, WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO THE IMPRISONMENT OF MAJ D'AUBUISSON ONCE HE
LOSES HIS PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY.

DECLARED A STATE OF MAXIMUM ALERT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN VIEW OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUBVERSIVE ATTACKS ON POLICE STATIONS, A SPOKESMAN FOR THAT

ALERT.  YESTERDAY, PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT AS USUAL IN SOUTHERN
TEGUCIGALPA, WHERE SOME ARMY COMBAT UNITS ARE HEADQUARTERED.

   THE POLICE DEPARTMENT DECLARED THE STATE OF ALERT AS A RESULT OF A WAVE
OF VIOLENCE THAT BEGAN WITH THE KILLING OF THREE PEOPLE IN JANUARY.

SHOT TO DEATH IN NORTHERN TEGUCIGALPA ON 7 JANUARY, AND ATTORNEY CARLOS
LORENZANA, WHO DEFENDED JUAN RAMON MATTA IN HONDURAS, WAS SHOT TO DEATH

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE TWO HELICOPTERS THAT HAVE REPORTEDLY

HAVE NOT SUFFERED ANY DAMAGE.

   [REPORTER] HAVE THE HELICOPTERS BEEN DOWNED?

   SAN SALVADOR, 11 MAR 89 (AFP) -- [REPORT] [AFP SPECIAL
CORRESPONDENT ARTURO GUDINO] [TEXT] ALFREDO CRISTIANI, PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE OF THE SALVADORAN NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA),
WARNED TODAY THAT HE IS NOT WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IF HE WINS THE UPCOMING 19
MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   CRISTIANI SAID: "WE ARE WILLING TO TALK BUT NOT TO NEGOTIATE ANY
PLATFORM."  CRISTIANI WARNED THAT IF THE REBELS DO NOT LAY DOWN THEIR
WEAPONS AND JOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE, "THE BEST THING FOR
THEM TO DO IS TO LEAVE FOR NICARAGUA OR CUBA."

   AS SOMEONE WHO IS CONSIDERED CERTAIN TO BECOME THE NEXT SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT, CRISTIANI RECEIVED AN OVATION FROM A CHEERING CROWD THAT
GATHERED AT LA LIBERTAD SQUARE IN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE ARENA HELD ITS
LAST MAJOR DEMONSTRATION IN SAN SALVADOR.

   CRISTIANI ADDED: "WE WILL NEVER LET THEM ATTAIN POWER BY MEANS OF
RIFLES."

   THE ARENA CANDIDATE, WHO IS FAVORED TO WIN THE SALVADORAN
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, ASSERTED THAT ONCE HE ATTAINS POWER, HE WILL
GIVE FULL SUPPORT TO THE ARMY AND THE SECURITY FORCES "SO THEY CAN PUT
AN END TO THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY."

   CRISTIANI, A WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN, ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT IF HE WINS
THE ELECTIONS HE WILL PUT AN END TO THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKING
SECTOR AND FOREIGN TRADE ACTIVITIES, THE MAIN PILLARS OF A PLAN WHOSE
IMPLEMENTATION BEGAN AFTER THE COUNTRY'S 1979 COUP D'ETAT.  PRESIDENT
DUARTE KEPT THIS PLAN ALIVE AND THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROGRAM INTACT
DURING HIS PRESIDENTIAL TERM.

   "WE WILL DO AWAY WITH INCAFE (NATIONAL COFFEE INSTITUTE), WHICH HAS
STOLEN JOBS FROM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORAN PRODUCERS," THE
ARENA LEADER SAID, ADDING: "WE DO NOT WANT A BANKING OR A BUSINESS
GOVERNMENT."

   CRISTIANI, HOWEVER, DID NOT MENTION THE CURRENT AGRARIAN REFORM,
THROUGH WHICH YOUNG MILITARY MEN WHO LED THE 1979 COUP D'ETAT INTENDED
TO BREAK THE BACK OF THE OLIGARCHY.

   THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS, MOSTLY FROM THE UPPER AND MIDDLE CLASSES,
MARCHED ALONG THE MAIN SAN SALVADOR STREETS TODAY TO LA LIBERTAD
SQUARE, WHICH WAS FILLED WITH ARENA POSTERS AND RED, WHITE, AND BLUE
ARENA FLAGS.

   ARENA'S CRISTIANI SAID: "WE WILL ELIMINATE THE UNEMPLOYMENT
PROBLEM.  WE WILL BUILD ROADS AND INCREASE PRODUCTION.  WE WILL PROVIDE
THE MOST NEEDY WITH HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND ALL OTHER SERVICES."

   MEANWHILE, THOUSANDS OF YOUTHS CHEERED FOR CRISTIANI AND DANCED IN
LA LIBERTAD SQUARE TO SONGS RIDICULING ARENA'S MAIN OPPOSITION IN THE
ELECTIONS, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC], WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN
POWER.

   ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, ARENA FOUNDER AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE, DENOUNCED THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HE ACCUSED OF SPONSORING
THE PDC.

   D'AUBUISSON, WHOM THE PDC HAS ACCUSED OF BEING THE "BRAINS BEHIND"
THE MARCH 1980 ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, SAID:
"WHETHER THE WHITE BLONDS [CHELES] LIKE IT OR NOT, WE WILL WIN THE
ELECTIONS 10 YEARS AFTER THE 1979 FATAL COUP D'ETAT."

   D'AUBUISSON HARSHLY ATTACKED PRESIDENT DUARTE, WHO IS SUFFERING
FROM TERMINAL CANCER, AND REFERRED TO HIM AS "THE CRAZY AND WORN OUT
DUARTE."

   CRISTIANI IS WILLING TO TALK WITH THE FMLN, BUT ONLY WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW.  D'AUBUISSON SAID: "WE WILL
GIVE THEM TIME TO JOIN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC LIFE, LITTLE BY
LITTLE."

   ARENA'S MEETING, WHICH ACCORDING TO ITS ORGANIZERS DREW A CROWD OF
40,000 SUPPORTERS, ENDED WITHOUT INCIDENT TONIGHT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 MAR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS TODAY THREATENED TO MURDER INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE 19
MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IF THEY DO NOT RESIGN FROM THEIR POSTS.

   "ALL INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN THE 19 MARCH
ELECTORAL FARCE WILL BE MERCILESSLY PUNISHED BY THE PEOPLE'S JUSTICE
FOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR," THE GUERRILLAS
WARNED TODAY IN A MESSAGE BROADCAST BY RADIO VENCEREMOS, THEIR
OFFICIAL RADIO STATION.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IS OPPOSED TO
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND HAS ASKED THE PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE OR TO
DESTROY THEIR BALLOTS.

   THE GUERRILLA THREAT IS AIMED AT MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENTAL AND
MUNICIPAL BALLOT-RECEIVING BOARDS, MAYORS, JUDGES, PARTY DIRECTORATES,
AND ELECTORAL COLLEGE OFFICIALS.

   THE WARNING ALSO APPLIES TO THE OWNERS OF VEHICLES THAT OPERATE
DURING AN IDEFINITE TRANSPORTATION STRIKE THE FMLN IS SCHEDULED TO
INITIATE ON 16 MARCH AT 0000.

   SWEARING IN APPROXIMATELY 20 BALLOT-RECEIVING BOARDS IN SAN
SALVADOR, RICARDO PERDOMO, PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL,
SAID THE ARMED FORCES AND THE COUNCIL ARE PREPARED TO GUARANTEE NORMAL
ELECTIONS.

   "WE WERE EXPECTING THIS.  WE KNOW THE GUERRILLAS WILL IMPLEMENT ALL
TYPES OF BOYCOTTS TO HINDER THE ELECTIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, WE ARE IN A
POSITION TO GUARANTEE THE ELECTIONS," PERDOMO REITERATED.

   MILITARY UNITS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED SINCE YESTERDAY IN CITIES IN THE
EASTERN DEPARTMENTS OF MORAZAN, SAN MIGUEL, USULUTAN, AND LA UNION,
WHERE THE REBELS PERSISTENTLY SABOTAGE THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

   THE FMLN HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL INTENSIFY ITS "INSURRECTIONAL
ACTIONS" THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE NATION'S
ELECTRICAL AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS ON ELECTION DAY.

   THE GUERRILLAS ARE OPPOSED TO THE ELECTIONS BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY
ARE "PART OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN AND A MEANS OF LEGITIMIZING
THE CONTINUATION OF WAR, HUNGER, AND POVERTY."

   "THOSE WHO COOPERATE WITH THE ELECTORAL FARCE WILL BE THROWN OUT OF
THEIR HOMES, EXECUTED, AND THEIR PROPERTIES WILL BE SABOTAGED BEFORE,
DURING, AND AFTER THE ELECTIONS," THE REBELS SAID.

   THE GUERRILLAS SENT MESSAGES ON SATURDAY NIGHT TO THE MAYORS AND
MUNICIPAL COUNCILS OF EIGHT TOWNS IN LA UNION DEPARTMENT, DEMANDING
THAT THEY RESIGN OR THE FMLN WILL "BRING TO BEAR" AGAINST THEM "THE
ENTIRE WEIGHT OF POPULAR JUSTICE."

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 89 -- [TEXT] MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON YESTERDAY
STATED:  "I HAVE WITHSTOOD THE LOWEST SLANDER FOR 8 YEARS.  GOD ALMIGHTY
AND MY CONSCIENCE KNOW I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT REPUDIATED MURDER.

   "EVERY TIME THERE ARE ELECTIONS, WE HEAR THE SAME RUMORS THAT THERE IS
EVIDENCE ABOUT MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S CASE AND THAT IT WILL BE
PRESENTED.  THUS, A GREAT SHOW IS PRESENTED, BUT ONCE THE ELECTIONS ARE
OVER NO ONE REMEMBERS THAT MARTYR OF THE CHURCH.

   "DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT, SUPPORTED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, PDC,
RESORTS TO VILE DEFAMATION, SLANDER, AND LIES AGAINST ITS POLITICAL
OPPONENTS BECAUSE IT CANNOT HIDE ITS CORRUPTION."

   THIS STATEMENT WAS ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, ARENA,
DEPUTY TO REJECT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT, "IN A NATIONAL
RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK," THAT IMPLICATED D'AUBUISSON "IN MSGR OSCAR
ARNULFO ROMERO'S DEATH."

   "I AM SORRY I DID NOT SEE THE BROADCAST, BUT OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED ON
IT.  I CAN VERY WELL IMAGINE ALL THE DESPICABLE THINGS THAT WERE
IRRESPONSIBLY SAID TO TWIST THE TRUTH SO THE PDC COULD AGAIN USE MSGR
ROMERO'S DEATH AS AN ELECTION ISSUE.  IT IS ALL PART OF THE PDC'S
PROPAGANDA, BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL," D'AUBUISSON SAID.

   "THE MOST REPREHENSIBLE THING IS THAT THE DUARTE ADMINISTRATION USES
RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS, OPENLY ABUSING ITS AUTHORITY, TO SLANDER
ME--SIMPLY BECAUSE I AM THE PDC'S POLITICAL ADVERSARY, AND BECAUSE THE PDC
HAS NO EXCUSE TO JUSTIFY THE CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN CAUSED BY ITS
CORRUPTION."

   D'AUBUISSON ADDED:  THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' "LIE" IS AIMED AT
DECEIVING SALVADORAN CATHOLICS.  THAT IS DESPICABLE AND UNSPEAKABLE,
BECAUSE THEY ARE INSULTING MSGR ROMERO'S MEMORY.

   THE PDC HAS GOVERNED THE COUNTRY FOR 8 YEARS.  THE PDC CONTROLLED THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHEN MSGR ROMERO WAS KILLED.  THE CRUCIAL
QUESTION IS:  WHY WEREN'T THE NECESSARY MEASURES TAKEN TO CLARIFY THE CASE
AT THE TIME?  WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT CLAIM IT HAS THE EVIDENCE YET FAILS
TO PRESENT IT?  AH, BECAUSE THIS WOULD END THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL GAME
OF SAYING THAT IT IS INVESTIGATING MSGR ROMERO'S DEATH!  THIS ENTIRE
ATTITUDE IS REPREHENSIBLE, D'AUBUISSON STATED.

   HE ASSERTED:  I AM AWARE OF THE PDC'S INCREDIBLE PLOT TO SLANDER ME,
BUT THE PDC ONLY SAYS WHAT IS CONVENIENT.  IT IS A DIRTY GAME BUT GOD IS
MY WITNESS; MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW MY GREAT
CRIME HAS BEEN TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE MARXIST-LENINISTS.  THE PDC CANNOT
FORGIVE ME FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSELY LINKED WITH THOSE WHO "ARE
GREEN ON THE OUTSIDE [REFERENCE TO THE PDC'S PARTY COLORS] BUT RED ON THE
INSIDE."  HOWEVER, I WILL CONTINUE STRUGGLING LIKE A GOOD SALVADORAN SO THE
"TURNCOATS" DO NOT BETRAY US, AS WAS THE CASE IN NICARAGUA, MAJOR ROBERTO
D'AUBUISSON ARRIETA EMPHASIZED.

REPEAT: WE CALL ON ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HELPING TO ORGANIZE THE 19
MARCH ELECTIONS AND DEMAND THAT THEY PUBLICLY RESIGN.  THE 19 MARCH

   ARENA AND THE PDC REFUSED TO ACCEPT OUR PEACE PROPOSAL TO MAKE THE
ELECTIONS A TOOL FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR.  THEREFORE, THE
FEELING OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE IS ONE OF REJECTION OF THE 19

ATTACKED A U.S. CONVOY WITH M-16 RIFLE-FIRE," THE LEAFLETS READ.  CARCOMO
WAS A HONDURAN LEFT-WING AUTHOR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY.

   THE FPM, NAMED AFTER A CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADER OF THE LAST CENTURY, HAS
CLAIMED CREDIT FOR SEVERAL GUERRILLA ATTACKS IN THE PAST.

   HONDURAS HAS BEEN GRIPPED BY A WAVE OF VIOLENCE THIS YEAR, INCLUDING THE
ASSASSINATIONS OF A FORMER ARMED FORCES COMMANDER, A COMMANDER OF THE
ANTI-SANDINIST REBELS (SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES), AND A LAWYER OF AN
ALLEGED DRUG TRAFFICKING TSAR.

   PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HAS CALLED FOR NATIONAL DIALOGUE STARTING THIS
WEEK WITH THE GOVERNMENT, THE OPPOSITION PARTIES, LABOR UNIONS,
BUSINESSMEN, AND OTHER GROUPS TO TRY TO CURB THE SUDDEN SURGE OF VIOLENCE.

   HONDURAS, A CLOSE U.S. ALLY, HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A PEACEFUL COUNTRY
IN A REGION STRICKEN BY INTERNAL CONFLICTS.

TEGUCIGALPA OF MANUEL RUGAMA, KNOWN AS COMMANDER AURELIANO, THE SECOND IN
COMMAND OF THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES IN HONDURAS.

   HONDURAN NATIONAL POLICE ON MONDAY PRESENTED TO THE PRESS HONDURAN JUAN
BAUTISTA NUNEZ AMADOR AND NICARAGUAN LUIS FERNANDO ORDONEZ REYES, WHO TOLD
REPORTERS THAT COMMANDER AURELIANO WAS ASSASSINATED ON ORDERS FROM JOSE DE
JESUS PENA, THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY CHIEF OF SECURITY.

   MERCEDES BORGE, PRESS DIRECTOR AT THE NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, SAID
THERE IS NO JOSE DE JESUS PENA EMPLOYED AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN
TEGUCIGALPA AND THAT AURELIANO'S ASSASSINATION WAS PERPETRATED BY THREE
INDIVIDUALS AND NOT TWO, AS THE HONDURAN POLICE CLAIM.  BORGE SAID THAT
WHILE NICARAGUA MAKES SERIOUS AND FORMAL PROPOSALS TO ADVANCE PEACE
EFFORTS, IT IS WORRISOME THAT HONDURAN MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE CREATING
SITUATIONS THAT COULD UNLEASH CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  THERE
HAVE ALREADY BEEN TWO ATTACKS ON THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA,
BORGE SAID.  SHE ADDED THAT THE HONDURAN POLICE REPORT CONFLICTS WITH THE
AUTOPSY REPORT, BECAUSE IN HIS STATEMENT, NUNEZ AMADOR REFERRED TO ONLY A
.38-CALIBER REVOLVER AND A .45-CALIBER PISTOL, WHICH WERE NOT FOUND ON
RUGAMA'S BODY OR IN HIS VEHICLE.

   BOGOTA, 8 FEB 89 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO
RESHUFFLED HIS CABINET TODAY, APPOINTING FIVE NEW MINISTERS AND
RECONFIRMING EIGHT FOR THE FINAL PHASE OF HIS TERM, ACCORDING TO AN
OFFICIAL DECREE.

   THE REORGANIZATION OCCURRED AFTER THE MINISTERS PRESENTED A PROTOCOL
RESIGNATION TO ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO APPOINT NEW MINISTERS; SOME OF THEM
DID NOT WANT TO BE POLITICALLY DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING FOR A SEAT IN
CONGRESS IN THE 1990 ELECTIONS.

   THIS HAS BEEN THE THIRD IMPORTANT CABINET RESHUFFLE SINCE BARCO TOOK
OFFICE IN AUGUST 1986.

   THE FIVE NEW CABINET MINISTERS INCLUDE TWO WOMEN WHO WILL HOLD THE
POSTS OF PUBLIC WORKS AND LABOR MINISTERS.  THE OTHERS WHO WILL JOIN THE
CABINET WERE APPOINTED TO THE GOVERNMENT, COMMUNICATIONS, AND HEALTH
MINISTRIES.

   THE OUTGOING MINISTERS STATED IN THEIR PROTOCOL LETTER OF RESIGNATION
THAT A CABINET RESHUFFLE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO ACHIEVE
ITS GOALS IN THE FINAL STAGE OF PRESIDENT BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION.

   "WE HAVE SERVED IN A A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT PERIOD OF NATIONAL LIFE,
CHARACTERIZED BY SITUATIONS OF CRIMINALITY AND TERRORISM," THE RESIGNATION
LETTER STATED.

   THE LETTER ADDED THAT THE RESIGNATION RESULTED FROM SOME OF THE
MINISTERS' NOT WANTING TO BE POLITICALLY DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING FOR
PUBLIC POSTS.  COLOMBIAN LAW DEMANDS THAT THOSE ASPIRING TO PUBLIC POSTS
MUST NOT HAVE SERVED AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.

   LIMA, 6 FEB 89 -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS BY
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA] [EXCERPT] [REPORTER] ...TO AN ARRESTED LEADER OF
THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS
ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE WITH THAT GROUP?

   [GARCIA] THINGS SHOULD BE PROPERLY CLARIFIED BECAUSE ONE SHOULD NOT BE
INFLUENCED BY REPORTS OR ANECDOTES.  THERE IS AN ESSENTIAL FACT:  A HARD
BLOW HAS BEEN DEALT TO SUBVERSION WITH THE ARREST OF ONE OF ITS PRINCIPAL
CHIEFTAINS--NOT A LEADER BUT A CHIEFTAIN.  PERU HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF
BLOODY TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THERE CAN BE NO CONCESSIONS FOR TERRORISTS OTHER
THAN THOSE GRANTED BY THE LAW.  THIS FACT CANNOT BE DISPELLED BY AN
ANECDOTE LIKE THE ONE I READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS TODAY.  THE ESSENTIAL FACT
IS THAT THIS ARREST [OF VICTOR POLAY CAMPOS] IS A MAJOR BLOW TO
SUBVERSION.  IT WAS NOT MERELY GOOD LUCK, BUT IT WAS THE RESULT OF WORK
AND FOLLOW-UP BY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE
POLICE.  I BELIEVE THIS IS THE KEY POINT.  I HAVE SEEN THAT ATTENTION HAS
BEEN GIVEN TO A VISIT [PAID BY PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA TO POLAY
CAMPOS IN PRISON] WHICH WAS NEITHER A COURTESY VISIT NOR AN EXPRESSION OF
SUPPORT, BUT JUST A SUPERVISORY ACT, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FACTS.
ANOTHER OBJECTIVE OF THE VISIT, WHICH FOR SURE HAS ALREADY BEEN COMMENTED
ON BY SOME COMMUNIST POLITICIANS, WAS TO OBSERVE THE CONDITION OF THE
DETAINEE.  THE VISIT DID NOT MEAN THAT THE DETAINEE WAS GRANTED SPECIAL
STATUS.  WE DO NOT GRANT SPECIAL STATUS TO ANYONE, MUCH LESS TO THESE
MURDERERS WHO HAVE STAINED THE NATION WITH BLOOD.  THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE
LAW MUST BE STRICTLY ENFORCED ON THESE INDIVIDUALS.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE
VISIT BY PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA TO THE ANTITERRORIST
DIRECTORATE DOES NOT MEAN THAT A DIALOGUE HAS BEGUN OR THAT SOMEONE IS
BEING PRAISED, AS SOME ILL-INTENTIONED MASS MEDIA WILL PROBABLY SAY.

NOON WHEN A 39-MAN POLICE PATROL OF THE SANTA LUCIA DETACHMENT, REINFORCED
BY ANTI-NARCOTICS POLICE, SURROUNDED THE UCHIZA AIRPORT AND WAITED FOR THE
ARRIVAL OF TWO COLOMBIAN LIGHT AIRPLANES THAT WERE SUPPOSEDLY CARRYING
DRUGS.  A TIP HAD BEEN RECEIVED BY THE POLICE.

   THE LANDING STRIP WAS SUBJECTED TO CONTINUOUS SURVEILLANCE.  A 60-MAN
ARMED GROUP OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS APPEARED AT 1620.  APPARENTLY, THIS GROUP
WAS GOING TO PROTECT THE COLOMBIAN LIGHT AIRPLANES.

   THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARRIVED ABOARD SEVERAL VEHICLES.  THEY DID NOT KNOW
THEY WERE BEING WATCHED BY THE POLICE, WHOM THEY OUTNUMBERED.

   UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND IMPLEMENTING A MASTERLY PLAN, THE POLICE
FORCES APPEARED AND A SPECTACULAR SHOOT-OUT ENSUED.

   SURPRISED BY THE UNEXPECTED ATTACK, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS RETURNED THE
FIRE, WHICH LASTED FOR 1/2 AN HOUR.

   AS A RESULT OF THE CLASH, TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE KILLED AND FOUR WERE
INJURED AND TRANSPORTED TO THE CENTRAL HOSPITAL IN TINGO MARIA.  MEANWHILE,
15 DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE ARRESTED; THE REST FLED.

   AFTER THE INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS, THE CAPTURED DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE
FULLY IDENTIFIED.  THE FOLLOWING COLOMBIAN CITIZENS WERE INVOLVED:  FLORIAN
CARVAJAL TELLO, MARIO MONTES MURILLO, AND ROLAND ARAMAYO DIAZ.  THE

   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 22 MAR 89 -- [EXCERPT] THE FMLN GENERAL
COMMAND WILL SOON PRESENT A NEW PEACE PROPOSAL TO ARENA AND THEREFORE
CALLS FOR THE FORMATION OF A BROAD COALITION TO FACE THE NEW
GOVERNMENT, A COALITION TO INCLUDE THE PDC, WHICH IS NOW AN OPPOSITION
PARTY AFTER HAVING LOST THE ELECTIONS.

   FMLN COMMANDERS ANA GUADUALUPE MARTINEZ, SALVADOR SAMAYOA, AND JOSE
MARIA LOPEZ READ THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE AND SAID THAT ARENA'S REACHING POWER
DEFINITELY "MEANS THAT THE OLIGARCHY WILL REJOIN THE MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP."

   THE COMMANDERS ALSO EVALUATED THE LAST 5 YEARS OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST
THE DUARTE GOVERNMENT IN EL SALVADOR:

   SALVADOR SAMAYOA SAID:  "THE LAST 5 YEARS HAVE BEEN THE MOST
DIFFICULT.  THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WE ARE CLOSER
TO DEFINING THE CONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR.

   "IT HAS BEEN A LONG AND DIFFICULT WAR.  THE ENEMY WAS ILL-DEFINED,
ENJOYING CERTAIN POPULARITY AMONG THE PEOPLE, MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO
TRY AND PERSUADE THEM THAT OUR REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE WAS A TERRORIST WAR
WHEN THIS WAS NOT THE CASE."

   ANA GUADALUPE MARTINEZ SAID:

   "I BELIEVE THAT THE EVENTS THAT BEGAN IN 1981 ARE COMING FULL CIRCLE
NOW, BUT NOW THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES.

   "THE PDC EMERGED FROM A POPULAR STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP.  NOW
THEY ARE IN OPPOSITION AND CAN DEAL WITH THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION AS
EQUALS, AND THAT IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR US.

   "THE SPLIT WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IS FOR THE BETTER.  I BELIEVE WE
ARE NOW IN THE FINAL STAGES."

   WHEN MARTINEZ WAS ASKED HOW SHE WOULD DESCRIBE THE PDC'S ROLE IN EL
SALVADOR DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS, SHE REPLIED:

   "THE PDC PLAYED A VERY NEGATIVE ROLE.  IT PROLONGED THE WAR THAT WOULD
HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN VERY MUCH SHORTER, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PDC MAY
DEVIATE FROM THEIR PAST BEHAVIOR AND PLAY A DIFFERENT ROLE THAN THE
OPPOSITION, FAVORING A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT."

   THE FMLN COMMANDERS BELIEVED THAT ARENA'S VICTORY WILL BRING BACK THE
DEATH SQUADS.  THE FMLN COMMANDERS BELIEVE THAT NOW THE POSSIBILITY OF A
MILITARY COUP IS GREATER.

   CONTRARY TO WHAT MIGHT BE BELIEVED, THE FMLN COMANDERS SAID:  "WE DO
NOT SEE A STRONG RIGHT WING.  WE SEE THEM MORE TRAPPED POLITICALLY AND
ECONOMICALLY."  THE COMMANDERS ALSO ARGUED THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO FACE
THE SAME OLIGARCHY AND ARMY THEY FACED IN 1979.

   THE MESSAGE THEY HAVE FOR ARENA STATES:  "SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED?  IS IT
NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE LAUNCHED A MILITARY OFFENSIVE?"

   THE COMMANDERS SAID THAT, NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN IS READY FOR A GREAT
MILITARY EFFORT AND REITERATED THAT IF ANYTHING CLEARLY EMERGED DURING THE
LAST 2 MONTHS, IT IS THAT "WE ARE A POLITICAL MAJORITY IN EL SALVADOR."

CIRO LOPEZ, COMMANDER OF THE "EL PARAISO" GARRISON, WHICH WAS ATTACKED
BY THE GUERRILLAS ON 13 SEPTEMBER, DENIED TODAY THAT THREE U.S.
MILITARY ADVISERS HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE CLASH WITH THE REBELS,
CONTRARY TO WHAT THE U.S. MEDIA AND PRESIDENT HAVE STATED.

   LOPEZ SAID THE "THREE ADVISERS DID NOT SHOOT, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT
ARMED AND WERE IN A PILLBOX WITH A VIEW OF THE INSIDE PART OF THE
GARRISON TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE MORTAR FIRE."

   HE ADDED THAT THE THREE ADVISERS "HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN ANY
FIGHTING" BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO HIM, "THEY WERE IN A SECURITY AREA
DURING THE TERRORIST ATTACK."

   THE INFORMATION THAT THE U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS HAD DIRECTLY
PARTICIPATED IN THE SHOOTING CAUSED BY THE GUERRILLA ATTACK WAS
CARRIED BY THE WASHINGTON POST AND CORROBORATED BY PRESIDENT REAGAN,
WHO AFFIRMED THAT THEY HAD "FIRED IN SELF-DEFENSE."

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE WASHINGTON POST, THREE
U.S.  MILITARY ADVISERS RESPONDED TO THE REBEL FIRE AGAINST THE
SALVADORAN MILITARY INSTALLATION IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   THE ARMY SUSTAINED 9 DEAD AND 12 WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE FMLN
GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE "EL PARAISO" GARRISON.

   A U.S. DIPLOMATIC SOURCE WHO CHOSE TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS STATED IN
THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL THAT "THE ADVISERS HAVE A RIGHT TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES, ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT NOT TO PARTICIPATE
IN COMBAT OR ATTACK MISSIONS."

   IN HIS STATEMENTS, RONALD REAGAN SUPPORTED THE ACTION OF THE
MILITARY ADVISERS AND ADDED THAT "I HAVE NEVER SENT MY MEN TO FACE ANY
DANGER WITHOUT GIVING THEM THE CHANCE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IF THEY ARE
ATTACKED."

   IN MARCH 1987, DURING ANOTHER ATTACK ON THE GARRISON, U.S. SERGEANT
GREGORY FRONIUS, A MILITARY ADVISER, WAS KILLED.

   CURRENTLY, 55 OF THE 119 U.S. ADVISERS IN EL SALVADOR ARE MILITARY

   BOGOTA, 29 MAR 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] DIEGO MONTANA, ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE
PATRIOTIC UNION [UP], TOLD EFE TODAY THAT ONLY THE PARTICIPATION OF THE
SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNG) IN THE PEACE
TALKS COULD GUARANTEE A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN COLOMBIA.

   THE CNG GROUPS THE SIX MAIN LEFTIST GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS THAT
OPERATE IN COLOMBIA.  THERE ARE 20,000 GUERRILLAS IN 100 FRONTS THROUGHOUT
COLOMBIA.

   THE GROUPS COMPRISING THE CNG ARE THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF
COLOMBIA (FARC, COMMUNIST); THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY (EPL, MAOIST);
CAMILISTA UNION-ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (UC-ELN, PRO-CASTROITE); THE
19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19, NATIONALIST LEFT); QUINTIN LAME MOVEMENT
(INDIGENIST); AND THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS PARTY (PRT, TROTSKYIST).

   TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT, THE M-19, AND THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL
PARTIES WILL BEGIN IN BOGOTA ON 3 APRIL AS PART OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS,
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS BEGAN LAST JANUARY TO ACHIEVE
PEACE. 

   THE UP ANNOUNCED IN EARLY MARCH THAT IT WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE
ROUNDTABLES, THE NAME GIVEN TO THE TALKS THAT WILL BEGIN NEXT MONDAY AND IN
WHICH THE PARTICIPANTS WILL DISCUSS THE LARGE NUMBER OF POLITICAL CRIMES
THAT HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED BY RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS.

   SINCE THE UP WAS FOUNDED, NEARLY 1,000 OF ITS MEMBERS AND LEADERS HAVE
BEEN MURDERED.

   THE "DIRTY WAR" AGAINST THE LEFT, PROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS, AND HUMAN
RIGHTS ACTIVISTS HAS RESULTED IN 700 POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS SO FAR THIS
YEAR.

   THERE WERE 2,978 POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS IN 1988; 1,200 IN 1987; AND
1,000 IN 1986.

   IN ADDITION, NEARLY 1,500 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN CLASHES BETWEEN THE
ARMED FORCES AND GUERRILLAS IN 1988.  SO FAR THIS YEAR, ABOUT 100 PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN CLASHES.

   DIEGO MONTANA TOLD EFE THAT HE WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE M-19 HAD
INITIATED PEACE TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BUT HE NOTED THAT THE REST OF
THE CNG ACCOUNTS FOR 84 PERCENT OF THE REBELS. 

   "I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS HOLDING TALKS WITH 16
PERCENT OF THE GUERRILLAS," MONTANA SAID, "BUT THE PEACE PROCESS WILL NOT
BE SUCCESSFUL IF THE OTHER 84 PERCENT OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS KEEP ON
FIGHTING."

   MONTANA ALSO PRAISED THE LATEST COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE CNG, WHICH WAS
SIGNED BY THE FARC, THE EPL, AND THE UC-ELN, WHICH ANNOUNCED THEIR DECISION
TO BEGIN TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BUT WHICH LINKED THEIR PARTICIPATION TO
THE DISMANTLING OF RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS.

   MOREOVER, JACOBO ARENAS, COMMANDER OF THE FARC AND MEMBER OF THE CNG
STAFF, TOLD BOGOTA EMISORAS CARACOL NETWORK THAT "ANYTHING LEADING TO THE
OPENING OF ROADS, THE BUILDING OF BRIDGES, AND THE OPENING OF LOCKS IS
BENEFICIAL," AND HE PRAISED THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19
IN THAT REGARD.

   ARENAS, HOWEVER, SAID THE M-19 HAD PULLED ITSELF OUT OF THE CNG BY
REACHING A PEACE AGREEMENT ON ITS OWN AND THAT IN THE NEXT PLENARY MEETING
THE POSSIBLE EXPULSION OF THE M-19 FROM THE CNG WOULD BE STUDIED.
