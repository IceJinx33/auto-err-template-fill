DEV-MUC3-0602 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 23 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GROUP OF "EXTRADITABLES" IN
COLOMBIA, BELIEVED TO BE THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, SAID
TODAY THAT IT IS PREPARED TO DECLARE A TRUCE IF THE CONGRESS OF THE
REPUBLIC FORMS A "GRAND COMMISSION ON A DIALOGUE FOR PEACE."

   THE TRAFFICKERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WHO ALONG WITH THE MEMBERS
OF THE CALI CARTEL FORM THE MOST IMPORTANT COCAINE PROCESSING AND
DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD, MADE THEIR PROPOSAL IN A
LETTER ADDRESSED TO LUIS GUILLERMO GIRALDO, PRESIDENT OF THE COLOMBIAN
CONGRESS.

   THE "EXTRADITABLES" SAY THAT THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION MUST INCLUDE,
AMONG OTHER PEOPLE, CARDINALS MARIO REVOLLO Y BRAVO AND ALFONSO LOPEZ
TRUJILLO, MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ, FORMER MINISTER JOAQUIN
VALLEJO ARBALAEZ, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL CARLOS JIMENEZ GOMEZ, AND
FORMER PARLIAMENTARIAN GUIDO PARRA MONTOYA.  THE "GRAND COMMISSION"
MUST ALSO INCLUDE "REPRESENTATIVES OF LEFTIST MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND
THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, AND SHOULD SEEK A TRUCE BETWEEN THE RIGHT
WING AND THE LEFT WING," ACCORDING TO THE LETTER.

   THE DRUG KINGPINS SAID THAT THEY "AGREE THAT THE TOPIC OF
EXTRADITION SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE REFERENDUM," BECAUSE "WE DO
NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF MOBILIZING THE MASSES IN THE STRUGGLE
CONCERNING THE TURNOVER OF CITIZENS."

   IN THE LETTER, THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL LISTS FOUR
POINTS THAT IT BELIEVES COULD RESTORE PUBLIC ORDER IN COLOMBIA.

   THREE OF THE POINTS DEAL WITH NONEXTRADITION, AND THE FOURTH CALLS
FOR THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE, BECAUSE IT WAS UNDER THE POWERS
GRANTED IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY ISSUED ON 18 AUGUST THAT PRESIDENT
VIRGILIO BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION APPLIED A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO COMBAT
THE DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   ON THAT OCCASION, WHEN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS
ASSASSINATED, BARCO DECLARED AN "ALL-OUT WAR" ON THE DRUG MAFIAS,
REINSTATED EXTRADITION BY ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS WITHOUT PRIOR
JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS, AND ANNOUNCED THE CONFISCATION OF THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS' PROPERTY.  IN A DECLARATION ISSUED 6 DAYS LATER, THE
"EXTRADITABLES" ANNOUNCED A "COUNTEROFFENSIVE" AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT,
THE JUDGES, THE PRESS, AND THE "REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BOURGEOISIE" IN
REPRISAL FOR THE OFFICIAL ACTIONS.

   AT THE END OF THE LETTER ISSUED TODAY, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS URGED
THE PUBLIC TO "REFLECT," AND ADDED: "WE ALL WANT TO END THE DRUG
TRAFFICKING."

   "THE GOVERNMENT," THEY SAID, "WANTS TO END IT THROUGH ACTIONS OF
WAR, WHILE WE OFFER TO END IT THROUGH A DIALOGUE FOR PEACE."  THE
LETTER ENDS WITH THE QUESTION: "WHO IS RIGHT?"


DEV-MUC3-0603 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 24 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE POSSIBILITIES FOR A DIALOGUE
WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE INCREASED IN COLOMBIA DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS AFTER THE EXTRADITABLES ANNOUNCED THEY ARE WILLING TO END THE
WAR.

   THREE OF THE LEADERS MENTIONED IN THE EXTRADITABLES' LETTER THAT
CONTAINED A PROPOSAL TO TAKE PART IN A COMMISSION THAT WOULD
REPORTEDLY BEGIN MAKING CONTACTS FOR THE DIALOGUE TODAY ACCEPTED THE
MISSION AND SAID THAT THEY ARE READY TO COOPERATE IN THE COUNTRY'S
PEACE EFFORTS.

   THEY ARE MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ, FORMER LIBERAL
LEGISLATOR GUIDO PARRA, AND FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTER JOAQUIN
VALLEJO.  MEANWHILE, CARDINAL MARIO REVOLLO SAID THAT "THE MATTER MUST
BE STUDIED."

   THE EXTRADITABLES PROPOSED CREATING A NEGOTIATING COMMISSION IN A
LETTER SENT FROM CLANDESTINITY TO LIBERAL SENATOR LUIS GUILLERMO
GIRALDO, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS.

   THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE IS UNDER CONSIDERATION BY SOME
POLITICAL GROUPS, DESPITE THE POSITION ASSUMED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF
LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO HAS REPEATEDLY STATED HIS
OPPOSITION TO ANY STEP LEADING TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS
AND DRUG TERRORISTS.

   BARCO, THROUGH GOVERNMENT (INTERIOR) MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS, HAS
PUBLICLY SAID THAT A DIALOGUE WITH TERRORISM IS IMPOSSIBLE, AT LEAST
IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

   IN VIEW OF THE SITUATION, SOME POLITICAL SECTORS HAVE SPECULATED ON
THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN BARCO'S SUCCESSOR, WHO WILL BE
ELECTED IN FREE ELECTIONS IN MAY 1990. BARCO WILL LEAVE POWER ON 7
AUGUST 1990.

   THE MAFIA HAS PROMISED TO END THE WAVE OF TERRORISM UNLEASHED
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IF BARCO'S GOVERNMENT SUSPENDS THE EXTRADITION OF
DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO THE UNITED STATES.

   THEY HAVE ALSO PROPOSED ACCEPTING THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT
OF JUSTICE, WHICH RECOGNIZED THE LEGALITY OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED TO
FACE THE MAFIAS, BUT DID NOT RECOMMEND EXTRADITION BY EXECUTIVE
DECREE.

   THE COURT RULED THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW PREVAILS OVER COLOMBIAN LAW,
AND NOTED THAT EXTRADITION THROUGH A STATE OF SIEGE DECREE IS NOT
COMPATIBLE WITH THE CURRENT COLOMBIAN-U.S. TREATY.

   COLOMBIA AND THE UNITED STATES SIGNED AN EXTRADITION TREATY IN 1979
WHICH, ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL IN EFFECT, CANNOT BE APPLIED BECAUSE AT
THE END OF 1987 THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF INVALIDATED THE LAW THAT
ENFORCED IT.

   HOWEVER, SEVERAL COLOMBIAN JURISTS SAID TODAY THAT ONLY THE
COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER TO ACCEPT THE COURT'S
DECISION OR TO CONTINUE ACTING BY EXECUTIVE DECREE.

   IN THEIR PEACE PROPOSAL, THE EXTRADITABLES DEMANDED THAT THE
GOVERNMENT "GRANT COLOMBIANS THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFENSE,
ALLOWING THEM -- AS DEPORTED FOREIGNERS ARE ALLOWED -- TO EXHAUST ALL
LEGAL MEANS UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE LAW BEFORE RENOUNCING SOVEREIGNTY AND
TURNING THEM OVER BY EXTRADITION."

   VALLEJO, PARRA, AND GOMEZ MARTINEZ -- THE THREE MEMBERS PROPOSED BY
THE MAFIA TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEGOTIATING COMMISSION -- SAID TODAY
THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO WORK IN FAVOR OF PEACE IN THE COUNTRY.  THEY
AGREED THAT DIFFERENCES CAN ONLY BE EASED THROUGH DIALOGUE.

   "I AM WILLING TO TALK," SAID GOMEZ MARTINEZ, MAYOR OF MEDELLIN,
WHERE THE MEDELLIN CARTEL OPERATES.  OVER A YEAR AGO, GOMEZ MARTINEZ
WAS THE TARGET OF AN ATTACK BY THE THE EXTRADITABLES, WHO TRIED TO
KIDNAP HIM. "I AM WAITING FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S OKEY TO BEGIN THE
DIALOGUE," HE ADDED.

   VALLEJO, WHO DISCLOSED THAT IN MID-1988 HE PRESENTED TO BARCO'S
GOVERNMENT AN INITIAL DIALOGUE PROPOSAL FROM THE EXTRADITABLES, SAID
THAT "I AM WILLING TO TALK IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE."

   PARRA, A FORMER PARLIAMENTARIAN AND FRIEND OF PABLO ESCOBAR, THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL'S CHIEF, SAID THAT "I AM WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE
PEACE EFFORTS."

   OTHER SECTORS, PARTICULARLY POLITICAL GROUPS, AGREED THAT
NEGOTIATION IS THE ONLY WAY TO PUT AN END TO TERRORIST VIOLENCE IN
COLOMBIA.  


DEV-MUC3-0604 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 24 OCT 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [REPORT]
[PILAR CALDERON] [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT SAID TODAY THAT IT WILL
CONTINUE TO EXTRADITE COLOMBIAN CITIZENS SOUGHT BY THE UNITED STATES.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL USE ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS BECAUSE THERE IS
CURRENTLY NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THAT COUNTRY.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH ALSO DENIED ANY POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN A
DIALOGUE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE
GOVERNMENT POLICY IS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG-TRAFFICKING GROUPS AND
THEIR CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THE POLICY
ALLOWS NO ROOM FOR TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS, OR DIALOGUES.
THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT REJECTS ANY PROPOSAL TO MEDIATE WITH DRUG
TRAFFICKERS -- EVEN IF THE PROPOSAL IS DIRECTLY ISSUED BY THE
EXTRADITABLES OR THEIR SPOKESMEN.

   THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT
WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE LEGISLATIVE DECREE 18-60 OF 1989, WHICH
ALLOWS FOR EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS.  THIS DECREE
WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE.

   THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL JUSTIFIES ITS DECISION BY RECALLING
THE MANY ACTS OF TERRORISM PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS -- 222 IN 2
MONTHS -- AND THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS.  THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT THE
DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE NOW TRYING TO DISGUISE THEIR CRIMINAL POSITIONS
BY CLAIMING THAT THEY ADVOCATE PEACE.

   THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT OR SUSPENSION OF COLOMBIAN
CITIZENS' EXTRADITION WAS THE MAIN TOPIC DISCUSSED TODAY IN JURIDICAL
AND POLITICAL CIRCLES IN OUR COUNTRY AND IN THE UNITED STATES.
JOURNALISTS AND LAWYERS CAREFULLY READ THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE'S
RULING ON THE DECREE ALLOWING FOR EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE
CHANNELS.  EVERYONE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE EXTRADITABLES SAID, IN A
LETTER ISSUED YESTERDAY, THAT THEY FULLY ABIDED BY THE COURT'S RULING.

   THE COURT RULED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE EXTRADITIONS VIA ADMINISTRATIVE
CHANNELS ARE ALLOWED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN CASES WHERE THERE IS
ALREADY AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY, THE EXTRADITION MUST BE CARRIED OUT
ACCORDING TO THE TREATY.  THE COURT BELIEVES THAT THE RULING IS QUITE
CLEAR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS] THE GOVERNMENT
MUST DECIDE IF THERE IS A TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES OR NOT BEFORE
IT ENFORCES THE EXTRADITION THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS.  [END
RECORDING]

   NEVERTHELESS, THE COURT'S RULING DOES NOT END THE EXTRADITIONS TO
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH THE COURT BELIEVES THAT AN
EXTRADITION TREATY IS STILL IN EFFECT WITH THAT COUNTRY -- THE ONE
SIGNED IN 1888 -- AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED INSTEAD OF
 RESORTING TO EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS, THE
GOVERNMENT CLEARLY SAYS THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED
STATES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS] THE 1979 TREATY
HAD BEEN ANNULLED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, BUT ACCORDING TO
THE STATE COUNCIL, THAT TREATY REPLACED -- SO TO SPEAK -- THE 1933
TREATY SIGNED IN MONTEVIDEO AND THE 1888 TREATY.  THEREFORE, THINGS
ARE NOW THE SAME AS YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE.  [END RECORDING]

   MEANWHILE, THE BODYGUARD OF EL ESPECTADOR'S CHIEF OF DISTRIBUTION
IN MEDELLIN, PEDRO LUIS OSORIO, WAS ASSASSINATED THIS AFTERNOON IN A
DOWNTOWN AREA OF ANTIOQUIA'S CAPITAL.


DEV-MUC3-0605 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   CARTAGENA, 24 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [EXCERPT] THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED
THAT A CARBOMB EXPLODED TONIGHT IN A RESIDENTIAL SECTOR IN THIS
COLOMBIAN PORT OF CARTAGENA, SLIGHTLY INJURING ONLY TWO PEOPLE, BUT
CAUSING MUCH DAMAGE.  THE BOMB SERIOUSLY DAMAGED THE TELEPHONE
EXCHANGE OF THE BOCAGRANDE TOURIST AND RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT, A HOTEL,
A RESTAURANT, TWO MEDICAL CLINICS, AND A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

   ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE TWO WOMEN WHO WERE SLIGHTLY INJURED, THE
BOMB WAS PLACED BY TWO MEN IN A CAR, WHICH THEY HURRIEDLY ABANDONED 40
METERS FROM THE TELEPHONE OFFICE.

   THE AREA, WHICH WAS BLACKED OUT WHEN THE ELECTRIC LINES WERE
DESTROYED AND WAS LITTERED WITH GLASS, WAS CORDONED OFF BY POLICE, WHO
LAUNCHED A SEARCH THROUGHOUT THE CITY FOR THE TERRORISTS.

   SERGEANT MARTINEZ OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT THE BOMB HAD
CAUSED MUCH DAMAGE, ALTHOUGH HE ABSTAINED FROM GIVING AN ESTIMATE
UNTIL THE BUILDINGS ARE EXAMINED.

   ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE BOMBING, PRESS SECTORS
BLAMED IT ON THE DRUG MAFIA AGAINST WHOM THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED
WAR.

EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN OVER THE PRESENCE OF PERUVIAN SHINING PATH
TERRORISTS ON THE BORDER BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  THE ALSO
ANNOUNCED THE DEPLOYMENT OF MILITARY FORCES ALONG THE BORDER.

   IN REMARKS PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LOCAL PRESS.  GENERAL FELIPE
CARVAJAL, COMMANDER GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, STATED: "THE
SHINING PATH IS OPERATING ALONG OUR BORDERS AND WE HAVE DONE NOTHING
ABOUT IT SO FAR."  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   DEFENSE MINISTER HECTOR ORMACHEA YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED THAT MILITARY
TROOPS WILL BE DEPLOYED FROM BOLIVIAN CITIES TO THE BORDER AREAS.

   ACCORDING TO THE DEFENSE MINISTER, THE NEXT DEPLOYMENT OF MILITARY
FORCES TO REINFORCE THE BORDER AREAS FOLLOWS REPORTS ON "THE
UNPRECEDENTED ENTRY OF FOREIGNERS WHO ARE PLUNDERING" THE COUNTRY'S
NATURAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING WOOD AND GOLD.

   MOREOVER, THE POLICE COMMANDER HAS STATED THAT TERRORISM "IS A
PERMANENT LATENT FACTOR" IN BOLIVIA.  AS AN EXAMPLE HE MENTIONED THE
INDIAN-MARXIST ORGANIZATION "ZARATE WILLKA ARMED FORCES OF
LIBERATION."

   THIS GROUP BEGAN ITS ACTIVITIES IN AUGUST 1988 WHEN IT ATTACKED THE
OFFICIAL MOTORCADE IN WHICH THE THEN-SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ
WAS TRAVELING.  NO INJURIES WHERE CAUSED BY THE ATTACK.

   ON 24 MAY THIS YEAR, THE SAME ORGANIZATION MURDERED TWO U.S. MORMON
MISSIONARIES ON A CROWDED STREET IN LA PAZ.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 26 OCT 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] A DISPATCH
FROM LIMA.  TERRORIST ACTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON WEDNESDAY EVENING IN
THE PERUVIAN CAPITAL AGAINST THE EMBASSIES OF THE USSR AND THE PRC.
UNKNOWN PEOPLE WHO DROVE UP TO THE USSR EMBASSY IN A CAR PLACED A BOMB
UNDER ONE OF THE SOVIET DIPLOMATS' CARS.  BY A STROKE OF LUCK THERE
ARE NO DEATHS OR CASUALTIES.  THE CRIMINALS MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  WITHIN
15 MINUTES THE TERRORISTS DETONATED A CAR STUFFED WITH EXPLOSIVES THAT
HAD BEEN LEFT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE PREMISES OF THE DIPLOMATIC
REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.  FORTUNATELY HERE,
TOO, THERE WERE NO HUMAN CASUALTIES.  POLICE ARE CARRYING OUT A SEARCH
FOR THE ATTACKERS.  TO DATE NONE OF THE ARMED EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS
ACTIVE IN PERU HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE CRIMES.

   POLICE SPOKESMEN REPORTED THAT THE TWO POLICEMEN WERE GUARDING THE

KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE OR THE REASONS FOR THESE KILLINGS.  


DEV-MUC3-0609 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 27 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA ANNOUNCED TONIGHT IN THE COSTA RICAN CAPITAL
THAT HE WILL SUSPEND THE UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE DECREED ON 21 MARCH
1988, AND WILL IMPROVE THE ORGANIZATION OF HIS COUNTRY'S DEFENSE
BECAUSE "WE CANNOT GO ON WITH OUR HANDS TIED."

   ORTEGA, ADDRESSING STUDENTS IN THE AUDITORIUM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
COSTA RICA'S LAW SCHOOL, CONFIRMED THAT "WE HAVE NO OTHER WAY OUT BUT
TO SUSPEND THE CEASE-FIRE" IN ORDER TO "HIT THE CONTRAS HARD," BECAUSE
-- HE ASSURED -- THEY HAVE FAILED TO RESPECT THE TRUCE ON NUMEROUS
OCCASIONS.

   "THE CEASE-FIRE EXTENSIONS ARE OVER," ORTEGA SAID, STRESSING THAT
"WE CANNOT GO ON WITH OUR HANDS TIED," AND HE PROMISED TO PROVIDE
FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THIS STATEMENT ON 28 OCTOBER AT A NEWS
CONFERENCE.

   "THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK," HE SAID, WAS AN ATTACK ON
21 OCTOBER WHEN THE CONTRAS MURDERED 19 PEASANTS WHO WERE ON THE WAY
TO REGISTER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.

   "WE MUST GUARANTEE THE ELECTIONS," ORTEGA UNDERSCORED, POINTING OUT
THAT 2 DAYS AGO TWO ACTIVISTS FROM THE FSLN [SANDINIST NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] WERE ALSO MURDERED, WHICH CONSTITUTES "AN ATTEMPT
AGAINST THE ELECTORAL PROCESS."

   IN VIEW OF THIS SITUATION, HE ADDED, ON 22 OCTOBER "I MET WITH THE
ARMY COMMANDERS AND WE CONCLUDED THAT OUR HANDS WERE TIED" WITH THE
CEASE-FIRE DECREE.

   "THE UNITED STATES IS NOT REALLY WILLING TO DEMOBILIZE THE CONTRAS
AND THE CONTRAS AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE CEASE-FIRE TO INCREASE THEIR
ACTIONS," HE ADDED, EMPHASIZING THAT "WE CANNOT MAINTAIN IT UNDER
THESE CONDITIONS."

   "WE MUST SEEK A WAY TO GUARANTEE THE LIFE OF THE NICARAGUANS, SO
THE CEASE-FIRE MUST END," HE STATED, ADDING THAT THE TOP-ECHELONS ALSO
DECIDED TO "ORGANIZE THE DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY EVEN BETTER."

   REFERRING TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN, ORTEGA EMPHASIZED
THAT "WE MUST FULFILL OUR PLEDGES" CONCERNING THE CONTRAS'
DEMOBILIZATION, AND THE HONDURAN PRESIDENT ADVOCATES IT EVEN THOUGH
THE UNITED STATES IS NOT WILLING TO DO THAT.

   THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT WORE A UNIFORM AND HAD A RED AND BLACK
HANDKERCHIEF TIED AROUND HIS NECK UPON HIS ARRIVAL AT THE UNIVERSITY,
LOCATED IN EASTERN SAN JOSE.  HE WAS CHEERED AND APPLAUDED BY AN
EUPHORIC AUDIENCE THAT HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HIM SINCE 1800.

   ORTEGA ALSO SPOKE ABOUT OTHER TOPICS DURING THE HOUR, MAINLY THOSE
DISCUSSED AT THE HEMISPHERIC SUMMIT HE IS ATTENDING ALONG WITH 15
HEADS OF STATE FROM THE CONTINENT -- INCLUDING THE FOREIGN DEBT,
DISARMAMENT, AND DEVELOPMENT.

   "I HAVE COME TO THIS MEETING WITH THE DESIRE TO TALK TO ALL OF THE
HEADS OF STATE PARTICIPATING," HE NOTED, ADDING THAT "I AM PLEASED
WITH THE TALKS I HAVE HELD," ON THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, THE DEBT,
TRADE, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING FIGHT, THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA,
AND THE NEED TO A PROMOTE THE NORTH-SOUTH DIALOGUE.

   IN ADDITION, HE SAID THAT HE DISCUSSED THE COFFEE PROBLEM WITH
BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JOSE SARNEY, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO,
AND THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT IN VIEW OF THE NEED TO SEEK A COMMON
LATIN AMERICAN POSITION TO FIX THE COFFEE PRICE.

   REGARDING EL SALVADOR, THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT INSISTED THAT "NOT
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST COMPARISON CAN BE MADE BETWEEN THE CONTRAS AND THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)."

   "THE CONTRAS' CAMPS ARE IN HONDURAN TERRITORY AND THE FMLN'S CAMPS
ARE IN EL SALVADOR, HE SAID, POINTING OUT THAT "THIS IS VERIFIABLE,"
AND "EL SALVADOR'S PROBLEM IS NOT NICARAGUA'S PROBLEM." [QUOTATION
MARKS AS RECEIVED]

   REGARDING PANAMA, ORTEGA SAID THAT WE DEFEND SELF-DETERMINATION AND
"ALL OF LATIN AMERICAN SHOULD BE CONCERNED THAT THE PANAMANIANS ARE
THE ONES WHO FIND A SOLUTION TO THEIR PROBLEMS."

   AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS "CHAT" WITH THE STUDENTS, ORTEGA WENT
IMMEDIATELY TO THE NATIONAL THEATRE, IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE, WHERE THE
16 HEADS OF STATE OF THE CONTINENT WERE SCHEDULED TO DINE TONIGHT,
DURING THE CONTINUATION OF THE EVENTS MARKING THE CENTENNIAL OF COSTA
RICAN DEMOCRACY.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 27 OCT 89 (IZVESTIYA) -- [INTERVIEW WITH VLADIMIR
KOTOV, HEAD OF THE TASS DEPARTMENT IN PERU, BY OWN CORRESPONDENT
YEVGENIY BAY] [TEXT] ON THE MORNING OF 26 OCTOBER THE EDITORIAL OFFICE
RECEIVED TELEGRAMS FROM REUTERS AND AFP FROM THE PERUVIAN CAPITAL,
WHICH SAID THAT BOMBS HAD GONE OFF THE DAY BEFORE OUTSIDE THE SOVIET
AND PRC EMBASSIES IN LIMA.  OUR CORRESPONDENT YEVGENIY BAY CONTACTED
VLADIMIR KOTOV, HEAD OF THE TASS DEPARTMENT IN PERU, BY TELEPHONE AND
ASKED HIM FOR THE DETAILS.

   [KOTOV] ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS DROVE UP TO
THE SOVIET EMBASSY BUILDING AND PLANTED A BOMB UNDER A CAR BELONGING
TO ONE OF OUR DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL.  THEY HARDLY HAD TIME TO DRIVE OFF
BEFORE AN EXPLOSION RANG OUT.  ONE CAR WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED AND THREE
NEIGHBORING VEHICLES WERE DAMAGED.  THIS HAPPENED AT 2015 LOCAL TIME.
AND AT 2030 HOURS A VOLKSWAGEN PARKED NEAR THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRC
EMBASSY EXPLODED AFTER BEING PACKED WITH DYNAMITE.

   FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE NO CASUALTIES AND NO MEMBERS OF THE
DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS ARE HURT.  THE BUILDINGS ARE NOT REALLY DAMAGED.

   [BAY] SO FAR, ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AGENCIES, NONE OF THE
TERRORIST GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS ACTION, ALTHOUGH THE POLICE SUSPECT THE EXTREME LEFT-WING
MAOIST ORGANIZATION, "SENDERO LUMINOSO."

   [KOTOV] JUDGING BY THE HALLMARK, IT COULD QUITE WELL BE.  AS IS
WELL KNOWN, "SENDERO LUMINOSO" HAS CARRIED OUT SEVERAL ATTACKS ON
SOVIET MISSIONS AND OUR CITIZENS IN THE LAST 3 YEARS.  MANY REMEMBER
THE INCIDENT WHEN FOUR UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE TELEPHONED THE SOVIET
EMBASSY -- ALLEGEDLY TO DELIVER SOME SORT OF PACKAGE.  IN THE END, ONE
OF THE TERRORISTS GOT INTO THE EMBASSY GROUNDS AND, AT THAT MOMENT,
THE "PACKAGE" EXPLODED IN HIS HANDS.  AND SEVERAL MONTHS AGO
(IZVESTIYA REPORTED THIS) TERRORISTS PLANTED A BOMB UNDER A BUS IN
WHICH SOVIET FISHERMEN WERE TRAVELING.

   [BAY] AN EXTENSION OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE COUNTRY HAS
BEEN ANNOUNCED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ESCALATION IN TERRORIST ACTIONS.
HOW DOES THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY LOOK FROM WHERE YOU STAND?

   [KOTOV] THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS INTRODUCED HERE IN FEBRUARY 1986
AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED VIRTUALLY EVERY 30-60 DAYS SINCE THEN.  IT IS IN
EFFECT IN 35 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY, PARTICULARLY IN LIMA
AND THE CAPITALS OF A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE WAVE OF
TERRORISM IS SHOWING NO SIGN OF ABATING -- EITHER ON THE PART OF THE
FAR RIGHT OR THE FAR LEFT.  IN OCTOBER ALONE, THEIR ACTIONS CLAIMED
200 LIVES.

   "SENDERO LUMINOSO" IS TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THE POPULATION AND WRECK
THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS PLANNED FOR 12 NOVEMBER.  THEY HAVE PARTIALLY
ACHIEVED THEIR AIM.  TO THE UNINFORMED, PERUVIAN STATISTICS ARE SIMPLY
HORRIFYING: IN THE LAST 3 YEARS, 64 MAYORS OF VARIOUS SMALL AND
MEDIUM-SIZED TOWNS IN THE ANDES HAVE BEEN KILLED.  NATURALLY, THERE
ARE FEW BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE THE RISK OF HOLDING THIS POST.

   [BAY] WHAT KIND OF CONDITIONS ARE SOVIET REPRESENTATIVES IN PERU
LIVING AND WORKING IN?

   [KOTOV] SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO RESTRICTIONS ON OUR FREEDOM OF
MOVEMENT.  HOWEVER, THE ESCALATION OF TERRORISM NATURALLY AFFECTS OUR
WELLBEING.  PEOPLE LIVE IN A STATE OF TENSION.  YOU EXPECT SOMETHING
AWFUL TO HAPPEN AT ANY MOMENT.  YOU HAVE TO SHOW THE MAXIMUM CAUTION
EVERYWHERE: BOTH AT HOME AND ON THE STREET.

DEV-MUC3-0612 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   WASHINGTON DC (USA), 28 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT THE DECISION TO SUSPEND THE
CEASE-FIRE IN NICARAGUA, AS IT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED BY NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA, WOULD BE "VERY UNFORTUNATE" AND "WOULD POSE
PROBLEMS FOR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN."

   DURING AN INTERVIEW GRANTED IN SAN JOSE TO CNN, A U.S. TELEVISION
NETWORK, CRISTIANI ALSO SAID THAT HE HAS DISCARDED THE POSSIBILITY OF
A MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA.  REGARDING HIS TALKS WITH THE ARMED
OPPOSITION IN HIS COUNTRY HE SAID HE IS "CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC."

   CRISTIANI SAID HE WOULD BE "DISAPPOINTED" IF THE NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT WERE TO SUSPEND THE UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE DECREED ON 21
MARCH 1988.  THIS WOULD PROVE, CRISTIANI SAID, THAT ORTEGA IS NOT
WILLING "TO RESPECT THE PROMISES MADE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PEACE PLAN" SIGNED IN 1987 BY COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR,
NICARAGUA, GUATEMALA, AND HONDURAS.

   ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, ORTEGA HAS ALREADY BROKEN HIS COMMITMENT BY
CONTINUING TO SEND ARMS TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN), AS HONDURAS REVEALED THIS WEEK.

   CRISTIANI ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT "NOT MUCH CAN BE DONE" IF ORTEGA
UPHOLDS THE DECISION HE ANNOUNCED ON 27 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE WHERE HE
AND 15 OTHER CHIEFS OF STATE OF THE CONTINENT ATTENDED AN INTER -
AMERICAN SUMMIT.

   REGARDING PANAMA, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE OAS
COUNTRIES WILL "CONTINUE MAKING EFFORTS, ESPECIALLY DIPLOMATIC
EFFORTS, TO ESTABLISH DEMOCRACY" IN THAT COUNTRY "IN THE NEAR FUTURE."
HE DISCARDED THE POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA.
"NO ONE HERE (IN SAN JOSE, WHERE MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN OPPOSITION
WERE ALSO PRESENT) IS IN FAVOR OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA."

   CRISTIANI STATED HIS SUPPORT FOR U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH WITH
REGARD TO THE RECENT COUP ATTEMPT IN PANAMA.  CRISTIANI SAID THAT BUSH
"DID WHAT HE HAD TO" WHEN HE REJECTED A MILITARY INTERVENTION ON THE
SIDE OF THE COUPISTS.  REGARDING THE PEACE TALKS HIS GOVERNMENT IS
HOLDING WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN],
CRISTIANI DECLARED HIMSELF "CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC" AND NOTED THAT
CONTRARY TO THE TALKS HELD BETWEEN THE FMLN AND FORMER PRESIDENT JOSE
NAPOLEON DUARTE, THE CURRENT MEETINGS ARE NOT "ISOLATED EVENTS."  NOW,
HE SAID, "THE PROCESS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT."  THIS PROCESS, HE
ADDED, IS THE "RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT SIGNED LAST SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO
BY THE TWO SIDES."

   REGARDING CHARGES BY A SALVADORAN SOLDIER, CESAR VIELMAN JOYA
MARTINEZ, WHO SAID THIS WEEK THAT HE PARTICIPATED IN ASSASSINATIONS
COMMITTED BY A DEATH SQUAD ON ORDERS, ACCORDING TO HIM, FROM THE
SALVADORAN HIGH MILITARY COMMAND AND WHO ALSO NOTED THAT U.S.
MILITARY ADVISERS HAD TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, CRISTIANI SAID THAT
THESE CHARGES ARE PART OF "FMLN EFFORTS" TO DISCREDIT HIS GOVERNMENT.

   MARTINEZ WILL BE "SENTENCED TO JAIL FOR HAVING DONE WHAT HE HAS

   BOGOTA, 28 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] "THE EXTRADITABLES" CLANDESTINE
GROUP TODAY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAST NIGHT'S DYNAMITE ATTACK
AGAINST A POLICE AIR BASE AT GUAIMARAL, 25 KM TO THE NORTH OF BOGOTA,
KILLING A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER.

   THROUGH ANONYMOUS PHONE CALLS TO VARIOUS MEDIA IN THE NORTHEAST OF
MEDELLIN, ANTIOQUIA PROVINCE, THE EXTRADITABLES CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY
FOR PLACING A BOMB INSIDE ONE OF THE SMALL AIRPORT'S BATHROOMS.

   THE EXTRADITABLES ARE COMPRISED OF THE MAIN COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKING CAPOS, WHO, THROUGH VIOLENT ACTS, ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE
GOVERNMENT GIVE UP ON ITS DECISION TO EXTRADITE THEM TO THE UNITED
STATES.

   THE AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING NOTHING ABOUT THE ATTACK AND DENIED

   LIMA, 28 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] PERUVIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER EMILIO
REYNOSO AGUILAR, ALIAS "RETACO I," ARRIVED IN LIMA TODAY UNDER STRICT
POLICE SECURITY.  REYNOSO WAS EXTRADITED FROM COLOMBIA TO BE TRIED
HERE ON CHARGES OF MURDER, KIDNAPPING, DRUG TRAFFICKING, ROBBERY, AND
OTHER CRIMES.

   "RETACO I" IS LINKED TO COLOMBIA'S MEDELLIN CARTEL.  HE WAS HANDED
OVER TO PERUVIAN POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAD TRAVELED TO COLOMBIA TO BRING
HIM TO LIMA, WHERE HE IS UNDER INDICTMENT BY NINE DIFFERENT COURTS.

   REYNOSO IS KNOWN IN LIMA AS "THE ESCAPE KING" BECAUSE HE HAS
ESCAPED FROM PERUVIAN JAILS A NUMBER OF TIMES DISGUISED AS A WOMAN OR
A POLICE OFFICER.  REYNOSO ESCAPED FROM THE JUSTICE PALACE AFTER
TAKING THE POLICE OFFICER GUARDING HIM HOSTAGE.

   "RETACO I'S" BROTHERS HAVE SIMILAR ALIASES; THEY ARE CALLED RETACO
II, III, AND IV.  ALL OF THEM HAVE ACCOUNTS TO SETTLE WITH THE COURTS,
BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM IS CURRENTLY IN JAIL.

   "RETACO I" LEFT PERU ON 1984 TO CONTINUE HIS CRIMINAL CAREER IN
OTHER COUNTRIES.  HE FINALLY ENDED UP IN COLOMBIA, WHERE HE WORKED
WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS UNTIL HIS ARREST.  REYNOSO IS CONSIDERED VERY
DANGEROUS.  THE PROBLEM FOR THE PERUVIAN POLICE WILL NOW BE TO KEEP
"THE ESCAPE KING" IN JAIL.

THE ATTACK, IN WHICH FIVE VENEZUELAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED, ON THE
BORDER AREA BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  THE GUERRILLAS HAVE ANNOUNCED
THEY WILL CONTINUE HARASSING THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY FORCES.

   IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE DELIVERED TO THE PRESS IN THE CITY OF SAN

DOMINGO CAVALLO TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT HAS
ASKED THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT TO "INTERCEDE WITH THE OTHER CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND WITH ANYONE ELSE THAT MAY HAVE INFLUENCE OVER
THE CONTRAS" TO MAKE THEM DISBAND.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO ACCOMPANIED PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM TO
COSTA RICA AND NICARAGUA, SAID THAT "IN ORDER TO MAKE THE NICARAGUAN
ELECTORAL PROCESS EASIER, MENEM HAS ANSWERED THAT HE WILL DO
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO HELP BRING PEACE TO THAT REGION."

WITH DANIEL ORTEGA IN MANAGUA, THE ARGENTINE CHIEF EXECUTIVE RECEIVED
"INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF THE CONTRAS, DURING
WHICH 18 PEASANTS WERE KILLED RECENTLY."  HE ADDED THAT "UNFORTUNATELY
THE RESURGENCE OF HOSTILITIES COULD JEOPARDIZE THE ELECTORAL PROCESS"
THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION.

   ON 28 OCTOBER MENEM HAD EXPRESSED HIS DISAGREEMENT WITH NICARAGUA'S
DECISION TO TERMINATE THE UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE. THIS DECISION HAD
PROMPTED AN INCIDENT INVOLVING U.S. PRESIDENT GEROGE BUSH, WHO ACCUSED
THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT OF BEHAVING "LIKE A WILD ANIMAL AT A PARTY."

   DURING HIS MEETING WITH MENEM, THE NICARAGUAN LEADER JUSTIFIED THE
DECISION BY LISTING THE VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT THE CONTRAS HAVE CARRIED
OUT AND EXPLAINED THAT FOR THE CEASEFIRE TO BE REINSTATED "THE CONTRAS
MUST DISBAND IN KEEPING WITH THE DECISION REACHED BY THE LATIN
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AT THE MEETING IN TELA (HONDURAS)."

   CAVALLO SAID THAT ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE ARGENTINE MEMBERS
OF THE OAS OBSERVATION TEAM, SO FAR, "THE ELECTORAL MECHANISMS SET UP
FOR THE 25 FEBRUARY 1990 ELECTIONS ARE WORKING WELL," AND THAT THERE
IS "INTENSE" POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN NICARAGUA.

   ASKED WHETHER THE SANDINISTS RESPECT THE OPPOSITION, CAVALLO STATED
THAT VIOLETA CHAMORRO, DURING HER MEETING WITH MENEM IN COSTA RICA,
HAD STATED THAT "THE USE OF OFFICIAL NEWS MEDIA IS ALLOCATED

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 1 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS
CONFERENCE WITH PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS]
[TEXT] [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, REGARDING POINT NO. 6 IN WHICH YOU
SPOKE ABOUT SPECIFIC RESULTS CONCERNING THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE
CONTRAS, TO WHAT SPECIFIC AMOUNTS IS THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT
REFERRING TO?  ARE YOU SAYING THAT 20 PERCENT, 10 PERCENT OR 50
PERCENT OF THE CONTRAS HAVE TO BE DEMOBILIZED IN ORDER FOR THE
CEASE-FIRE TO BE IMPLEMENTED AGAIN?

   [ORTEGA] THE IMPORTANT POINT IS TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN.
THEN, THE NUMBER OF CONTRAS THAT ARE DEMOBILIZED WOULD BE ESTABLISHED
ACCORDING TO THE DECISIONS MADE AT THE UNITED NATIONS.  THAT IS, HOW
MANY CONTRAS CAN BE DEMOBILIZED RIGHT AWAY, HOW MANY OF THEM WILL BE
RETURNING TO NICARAGUA, HOW MANY WILL GO TO THIRD COUNTRIES.
THEREFORE, TO THE EXTENT THE PLAN IS BEING IMPLEMENTED, WE WILL BE
WILLING TO REINSTATE THE CEASE-FIRE.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, UP UNTIL LAST WEEK, THE U.S. CONGRESS
DISCUSSED GIVING MORE AID TO THE CONTRAS.  NO ONE EVEN WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT THE CONTRAS, IT WAS A STALE ISSUE.  HOWEVER, IT HAS BECOME A
BURNING ISSUE OVERNIGHT AND EVERYBODY IS NOW TALKING ABOUT AID FOR THE
CONTRAS AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING MILITARY AID TO THEM.  LAST
NIGHT, THE U.S. SENATE ISSUED A RESOLUTION STRONGLY CONDENMING THE
NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT.  MY QUESTIONS ARE: FIRST, WHY HAS THERE BEEN
SUCH A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE.  SECOND, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO
THE U.S. CONGRESS.

   [ORTEGA] U.S. CONGRESSMEN ARE ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR
REELECTION.  WITH THE DUE RESPECT THAT SOME OF THEM DESERVE, U.S.
CONGRESSMEN ARE ONLY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR REELECTION.  I HAVE TALKED TO
MANY OF THEM HERE AND THEY ARE CYNICAL.  THEY TELL ME: I DISAGREE WITH
THAT BUT I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO ELECTED ME.  IF THOSE WHO
ELECTED ME HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION, THEN I HAVE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT
FOR THEIR VIEWPOINTS AND FORGET ABOUT MY OWN OPINION.  LET US NOT
MISLEAD OURSELVES.  YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW U.S. CONGRESSMEN ACT.
THEREFORE, IT WAS EASIER FOR THEM TO SIMPLY APPROVE FUNDS FOR THE
CONTRAS AS THEY HAD DONE -- BECAUSE THE CONGRESS HAD APPROVED THE
SO-CALLED HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE CONTRAS [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND LET
THE WAR CONTINUE, AND LEAVE THE BURDEN ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
GOVERNMENTS, ESPECIALLY ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE WHO
ARE SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF THIS WAR.  THEREFORE, WE HAVE BEEN
REPORTING THE KILLINGS, THE ASSASSINATIONS, THE CRIMES, THE CONTRAS
ATTACKS, AND THE YANKEE CONGRESS HAS REMAINED SILENT.

   THEREFORE, WE SEE AN EASY-GOING ATTITUDE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS.
OBVIOUSLY, WHEN WE ANNOUNCE WE ARE NOT GOING TO EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE
THE U.S. CONGRESS REACTS IMMEDIATELY.  THEY REACT BECAUSE THEY ARE
FULLY AWARE THAT THEY ARE MEDDLING IN NICARAGUAN POLITICS.  THEY WILL
HAVE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE, AND THEY DO NOT
WANT TO DISCUSS THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AGAIN.  IT WAS EASY TO SET ASIDE
THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AND TO SIMPLY APPROVE FUNDS FOR THE CONTRAS SO
THE CONTRAS COULD CONTINUE KILLING NICARAGUANS WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE
REMAINS CALM -- LET THE PEACE PLAN CONTINUE AS FAR AS IT CAN AND AS
FAR AS PRESIDENT BUSH ALLOWS IT TO DEVELOP.  THE U.S. CONGRESSMEN CAN
THEN FORGET ABOUT THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AND WORK ON OTHER DOMESTIC OR
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES IN WHICH THEY ARE MORE INTERESTED.

   HOWEVER, WHEN NICARAGUA SAYS: WE WILL NOT EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE,
THEN THEY RAISE AN OUTCRY.  WHY DO THEY RAISE AN OUTCRY?  BECAUSE THEY
KNOW THEY WILL HAVE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE.
MOREOVER, THERE MIGHT BE A FEVERISH CONGRESSMAN WHO WILL PROPOSE
GIVING MILITARY AID TO THE CONTRAS.  WELL, LET THEM DISCUSS MILITARY
AID.  DO THEY WANT TO DISCUSS MILITARY AID, WELL THAT IS THEIR
PROBLEM.  WE SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE YANKEE CONGRESS ACTIONS
WILL EASE OR HINDER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  THE DEVELOPMENT OF
ELECTIONS ON 25 FEBRUARY WILL DEPEND NOW ON THE YANKEE CONGRESS AND ON
THE YANKEE PRESIDENT.  IT WILL DEPEND ON THEM.  WE HAVE THE DESIRE TO
DO IT.  HOWEVER, WHETHER OR NOT THE ELECTIONS ARE HELD ON 25 FEBRUARY
WILL DEPEND ON THEM.  [CONTINUED]

   LIMA, 1 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT TODAY TURNED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INTERNAL ORDER IN LIMA OVER TO THE ARMED
FORCES, 2 DAYS BEFORE AN "ARMED STRIKE" DECLARED BY THE MAOIST SHINING
PATH TERRORIST GROUP GOES INTO EFFECT.

   ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL REPORT, THE MILITARIZATION OF LIMA WAS
DECLARED AT THE SAME TIME A GROUP OF 100 HOODED SHINING PATH ACTIVITS
STAGED A DEMONSTRATION, ENGAGED IN A SHOOT-OUT, AND HURLED EXPLOSIVES
AT THE POLICE IN LA VICTORIA DISTRICT.

   INTERIOR MINISTER AGUSTIN MATILLA REPORTED THAT 2 PEOPLE DIED AND
15 OTHERS WERE WOUNDED IN THE THE CLASH, WHICH PLACE WHILE A RELIGIOUS
GROUP WAS CARRYING OUT A PEACEFUL MARCH.

   ACCORDING TO A DECREE, THE ARMED FORCES WILL TAKE CONTROL OF LIMA
DEPARTMENT AND EL CALLAO PROVINCE, NEXT TO THE CAPITAL, WHERE A STATE
OF EMERGENCY IS IN FORCE.

   ON 23 OCTOBER, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT EXTENDED FOR 1 MONTH THE
STATE OF EMERGENCY IN LIMA DUE TO AN OUTBURST OF THE POLITICAL
VIOLENCE THAT HAS RESULTED IN MORE THAN 350 DEATHS NATIONWIDE LAST
MONTH.

   DESPITE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, WHICH SUSPENDS IMPORTANT
CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, UNTIL TODAY INTERNAL ORDER WAS THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL POLICE.

   PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TODAY TOLD THE MEDIA THAT THE POLICE ARRESTED
149 PEOPLE, OF WHOM ABOUT 100 ARE ALLEGED SHINING PATH MEMBERS, DURING
TODAY'S RIOTS.

   THE PERUVIAN CHIEF OF STATE SAID THAT THE RIOTS WERE MEANT "TO
HINDER" THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 12 NOVEMBER.  HE ADDED
THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL EXERT "ALL THE NECESSARY ENERGY TO COMBAT
SUBVERSION."

   THE SHINING PATH MEMBERS TODAY DEMONSTRATED WITH SHOUTS FAVORING
THE "ARMED STRUGGLE," AND THEY HANDED OUT LEAFLETS CALLING ON THE
PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN AN "ARMED STRIKE" ON 3 NOVEMBER.

   THE SHINING PATH, WHICH HAS BEEN ENGAGING IN WARFARE FOR THE PAST
10 YEARS, INTENDS TO PARALYZE LIMA WITH THE "ARMED STRIKE" -- A
GENERAL STRIKE UNDER ARMED COERCION -- ONLY 9 DAYS BEFORE THE
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.

   THE "SHINING PATH" HAS ALSO ANNOUNCED IT INTENDS TO BOYCOTT THE
ELECTIONS [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] LEADER OF THE ORGANIZATION, ABIMAEL
GUZMAN.

   THE MAIN PERUVIAN POLITICAL PARTIES, THE CHURCH, AND LABOR AND
PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CALLED, FOR THE SAME DAY, A
DEMONSTRATION IN FAVOR OF PEACE AND IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS
CONSIDERED TO BE THREATENED BY TERRORISM.

   THE "SHINING PATH" HAS INTENSIFIED ITS ARMED ACTIVITIES NATIONWIDE
DUE TO THE 12 NOVEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.  AS A RESULT, HUNDREDS OF
CANDIDATES HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE RACE.

   IN ITS PROCLAMATIONS, THE "SHINING PATH" THREATENED "TO ANNIHILATE,
SOONER OF LATER" ALL CANDIDATES WHO RUN IN THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.

VILLARREAL] [TEXT] FOR THE THIRD DAY IN A ROW, THE BLOODBATH CONTINUES
TO ROCK THIS CAPITAL CITY AND THE END TO THIS SITUATION, WHICH IS
ALARMING THE PEOPLE, DOES NOT SEEM TO BE NEAR.  ACCORDING TO REPORTS,
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] URBAN COMMANDS
FAILED ONCE AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON WHEN THEY ATTACKED THE HEADQUARTERS
OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE LOCATED IN LAICO NEIGHBORHOOD.  THE FMLN
URBAN COMMANDS FIRED TWO RPG-2 ROCKET LAUNCHERS WHICH HIT A PRIVATE
VEHICLE WITH LICENSE PLATE 72246 THAT WAS PASSING THE MILITARY
GARRISON.  AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL ATTACK, AN AGRONOMIST, IDENTIFIED
AS 57- YEAR- OLD JOSE HERMOGENES MARTINEZ, WAS KILLED.  WE DID NOT
TAKE PICTURES OF HIS BODY BECAUSE IT WAS TOTALLY MUTILATED AS A RESULT
OF THE STRONG EXPLOSION.  ALSO INJURED WAS A STREET VENDOR IDENTIFIED
AS MARIA DEL CARMEN PEREZ.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] THERE WERE FOUR MEN IN A
PICKUP, TWO SEATED IN FRONT AND TWO IN THE BACK.  THE TWO WHO WERE IN
THE BACK TOOK OUT THE BAZOOKAS AND FIRED ON THE GARRISON'S GATE.  A
MAN DRIVING A SUZUKI DROVE AT THE SAME TIME THE ROCKETS WERE LAUNCHED
AND HE WAS HIT.

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN THE VEHICLE?

   [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] FOUR.  THE CAR WHERE THE INJURED MAN WAS?
ONLY ONE PERSON, THE MAN WHO WAS INJURED.

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN THE VEHICLE FROM WHERE THE
ROCKETS WHERE FIRED?

   [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] FOUR PERSONS.

   [REPORTER] AT WHAT TIME DID THAT HAPPEN?

   [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] ABOUT 30 MINUTES AGO, AT APPROXIMATELY 1530.

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY ROCKETS WERE FIRED?

   [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] TWO.

   [SECOND UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] THE MAN WAS IN THE CAR.  AFTER THE
DEVICES EXPLODED -- WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT KIND WERE FIRED -- THERE WAS
SMOKE AND GUNPOWDER ALL OVER THE PLACE.  HIS CLOTHES AND BODY WERE
TOTALLY DESTROYED.  WHEN WE TOOK HIM TO THE ROSALES HOSPITAL WE TALKED
TO A DOCTOR, AND HE SAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO ALL THEY COULD TO
SAVE HIS LIFE.  [END RECORDING]

   MEANWHILE, COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER OF THE
MILITARY GARRISON, REGRETTED THE ATTACK AND SAID THAT THESE ATTACKS
ARE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE VIOLENCE UNLEASHED IN THE PAST FEW
DAYS BY GROUPS THAT ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [FUENTES] YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE VEHICLE.  WE
BELIEVE THE ROCKETS WERE AIMED AT THE GATE, AT THE GUARDS STANDING AT
THE ENTRANCE OF THE HEADQUARTERS.  PERHAPS THEY WERE AIMED AT ME
BECAUSE I HAD BEEN IN THE AREA 5 MINUTES EARLIER.

   THOSE PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR MINDS.  THEY DO NOT CARE
IF THE KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS.  THESE COULD BE GROUPS THAT THE FMLN
CAN NO LONGER CONTROL OR PERHAPS THEY ARE ONLY KILLERS WHO ONLY KNOW
HOW TO MURDER PEOPLE.  [END RECORDING]

   THE INJURED PERSONS WERE TAKEN TO ROSALES HOSPITAL IN SAN SALVADOR
WHERE THEY WERE GIVEN EMERGENCY TREATMENT.  THE STREET VENDOR SAYS
THAT IT WAS A MIRACLE THAT SHE WAS NOT KILLED.

SITTING THERE AND I HEARD THE NOISE [WORDS INDISTINCT].  [END

NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT TODAY CONDEMNED THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION
[FENASTRAS].

   A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENCY ACCUSES THE DEATH SQUADS OF
PERPETRATING THE 31 OCTOBER ATTACK IN WHICH A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED
AT THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS KILLING NINE PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE
WELL-KNOWN UNION LEADER ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ.

   THIS TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS, WHICH REVIVES RECENT
HISTORY IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, PROVES THE CRIMINAL NATURE OF THE
ULTRARIGHT-WING FORCES SERVING IMPERIALIST INTERESTS, AND REVEALS
THEIR TRUE INTENTIONS, DESPITE THEIR HYPOCRITICAL STATEMENTS ABOUT
DESIRING PEACE, FREEDOM, AND DEMOCRACY, THE DOCUMENT STATES.

   THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THIS AND OTHER CRIMES OBLIGE THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND ITS PEOPLE'S HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO FIND
AND PUNISH THOSE WHO ARE GUILTY.

   SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] SAID THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT IN RESPONSE TO THE 30
OCTOBER GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE ARMY'S GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GUERRILLAS'
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT THEY DECIDED TO SUSPEND THEIR DIALOGUE WITH
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CAUSED GREAT SURPRISE AMONG VARIOUS CIRCLES
IN THE COUNTRY THAT VOWED TO MAKE NEW EFFORTS TO REESTABLISH THEM.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SUSPENDED ITS
DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO PROTEST
A DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE HEADQUARTERS OF A LABOR UNION ON 31 OCTOBER
THAT LEFT 10 DEAD AND 30 INJURED.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN WORKERS
NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION (FENASTRAS).

   THE FMLN, IN A COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ITS TOP FIVE LEADERS, STATED
THAT "WE MUST NOT ALLOW OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIALOGUE TO BE USED TO
COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT MASSACRE."

   IT ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE OAS, UNITED NATIONS, AND THE CHURCH OFFER
GUARANTEES TO EL SALVADOR'S OPPOSITION GROUPS.

   REVEREND EDGAR PALACIOS, COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR
THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE (CPDN), WHICH IS MADE UP OF OVER 60 SOCIAL
ORGANIZATIONS, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "WE REGRET THIS KIND OF DECISION
VERY MUCH, BUT WE WILL IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE GUERRILLAS TO TRY TO
RESUME THE DIALOGUE."

   PALACIOS ADDED THAT "IF THE DOOR OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION IS
CLOSED, THE DOOR OF WAR WILL OPEN."

   EDUARDO COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE
MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY, SAID THAT THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE GUERRILLAS "MUST CONTINUE."

   "THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
(ARENA) MUST INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME
COMMITTED AGAINST FENASTRAS; HOWEVER, THE DIALOGUE MUST NOT BE
SUSPENDED," COLINDRES ADDED.

   JUAN JOSE MARTEL, LEADER OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT
(MPSC), WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE,
EXPRESSED SURPRISE OVER THE GUERRILLAS' DECISION.

   MARTEL SAID THAT RIGHT-WING SALVADORAN GROUPS ARE TRYING TO
ELIMINATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, WHICH SEEKS TO END THE WAR THROUGH
NEGOTIATED POLITICAL MEANS.

   SO FAR, NO GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN HAS REACTED TO THE FMLN'S DECISION
TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE THAT BEGAN IN MID-SEPTEMBER AND WOULD HAVE
CONTINUED ON 20 AND 21 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.

   PALACIOS, ALONG WITH OTHER RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, AND LABOR LEADERS,
HEADED A MARCH TO ACCOMPANY THE BODIES OF 10 WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED
DURING THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS IN DOWNTOWN
SAN SALVADOR, ONLY 200 METERS FROM A NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON.

   THE UNION MEMBERS' BODIES, INCLUDING THAT OF FENASTRAS LEADER FEBE
ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND WORKERS WHO
SHOUTED ANTIGOVERNMENT SLOGANS AND CARRIED RED FLOWERS.

   TENSION WAS HIGH DURING THE MARCH, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY
MILITARY PRESENCE IN SAN SALVADOR'S MAIN STREETS AND BECAUSE THE
UNION MEMBERS DETAINED AT LEAST 30 PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMEN WHO,
ACCORDING TO THE UNIONISTS, INFILTRATED THE DEMONSTRATION.

   THE MARCH ENDED AT THE GENERAL CEMETERY WHERE THE BODIES OF THE
UNION MEMBERS WERE BURIED.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 3 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] VENEZUELAN
PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS
ARE WORKING HARD SO THAT THE BREAK IN THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GUERILLAS
AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE ONLY TEMPORARY.

   ARIAS TODAY IN SAN JOSE ANNOUNCED THAT ON 6 NOVEMBER HE WILL MEET
IN SAN JOSE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SALVADORAN REBELS, ADDING THAT
HE HAD TALKED WITH PRESIDENT PEREZ REGARDING THE NEED TO "CALL ON THE
PARTIES INVOLVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TALK."

   THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT, WHO DID NOT DISCLOSE THE TIME AND PLACE
OF HIS MEETING WITH THE REBELS,, SAID THAT HIS GOAL IS TO "URGE THEM
TO PROMISE THAT THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIALOGUE WILL ONLY BE
TEMPORARY."

   ARIAS, 1987 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER FOR HIS PEACEMAKING EFFORTS IN
CENTRAL AMERICA, ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT "PERHAPS THIS IS NOT THE BEST
TIME FOR THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) TO BE RESUMED."

   IN THE PAST 8 DAYS IN EL SALVADOR, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTACKS
ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS, DURING WHICH
10 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND MANY INJURED.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT -- THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS HELD IN MEXICO CITY IN
SEPTEMBER AND THE SECOND ROUND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, IN OCTOBER --
FOLLOWING THE 31 OCTOBER ATTACK ON A LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS IN SAN
SALVADOR THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 10 LABOR LEADERS.

   "I VIEW THIS INTERRUPTION OF THE DIALOGUE WITH GREAT SADDNESS AND
REGRET; HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONLY A STUMBLING BLOCK IN A
PEACE PROCESS THAT IS NOT A VERY EASY ONE," THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT
SAID.

   PRESIDENT ARIAS SAID THAT HE HAD ASKED HIS VENEZUELAN COLLEAGUE --
WHO WAS TO HAVE HOSTED THE NEXT ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN -- TO JOIN IN HIS EFFORTS TO URGE THE PARTIES
INVOLVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TALK "WHEN THE SITUATION
IMPROVES."

   "ON THE PATH FOR PEACE THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN STEPS BACKWARDS ARE
TAKEN -- LIKE THE ONE CURRENTLY BEING TAKEN IN EL SALVADOR AND
PREVIOUSLY IN NICARAGUA," PRESIDENT ARIAS SAID IN ALLUSION TO THE
DECISION MADE BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S GOVERNMENT NOT
TO EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE WITH THE CONTRAS.

CARACAS, VENEZUELA, DESPITE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT'S (FMLN) DECISION TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE.

   CRISTIANI DISCLOSED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL INVESTIGATE THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ATTACK THAT KILLED 10 TRADE UNION MEMBERS ON 31
OCTOBER, WHICH THE FMLN HAS BLAMED ON ARMY AND GOVERNMENT SECTORS.  ON
THAT DATE, THE FMLN DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE THAT HAD BEGAN ON
17 OCTOBER IN COSTA RICA.

   HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT REJECTED "THE IRRESPONSIBLE AND
MALICIOUS ACCUSATIONS MADE BY THE FMLN THAT THE ATTACK HAD BEEN
CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMED FORCES WITH THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC."

   AFTER SUSPENDING THE DIALOGUE, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ASKED THE
UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE SALVADORAN CATHOLIC CHURCH "FOR
GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS."

   THE PRESIDENTS OF COSTA RICA AND VENEZUELA, OSCAR ARIAS AND CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ, RESPECTIVELY, TODAY OFFERED THEIR MEDIATION TO GET THE

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] VICE PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO MERINO SAYS THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE HURTING THEMSELVES BY
CARRYING OUT ATTACKS SUCH AS THE ONE PERPETRATED RECENTLY.  HE SAID
THE REBELS ARE ACTING LIKE OSTRICHES BY HIDING THEIR HEADS UNDER THE
SAND.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] LOGICALLY THAT IS NO SOLUTION. THEY MUST
REALIZE THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THEM.  THE PEOPLE CONDEMN ALL OF
THESE ACTIONS.  THE LATEST ATTACKS ARE HURTING THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] ITSELF.  THEY HAVE BEEN ISOLATED
INTERNATIONALLY, THE PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THEM, AND THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE ARMY ARE FULFULLING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE.  THEREFORE, THEY
MUST CONTINUE WITH THE TALKS AND PARTICIPATE IN THEM SERIOUSLY BY
REACHING AGREEMENTS THAT CAN BRING PEACE TO ALL. THE TERRORIST
AGGRESSION MAKES NO SENSE.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION?  WILL IT CONTINUE
WITH THE TALKS?  WILL IT GO TO THE TALKS EVEN IF THE GUERRILLA
COMMANDERS DO NOT ATTEND?

   [MERINO] THE GOVERNMENT DEFINITELY HAS A COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE.
IT IS A COMMITMENT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE.  BESIDES OUR WILLINGNESS
TO ACHIEVE PEACE WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO THESE TALKS.  WE WILL
CONTINUE ON THIS ROAD.  IT IS CERTAINLY A DIFFICULT ROAD BUT WE MUST
CONTINUE ON IT.  I BELIEVE THAT THE SAN JOSE MEETING LIKE THE ONE IN
CARACAS, AND MAYBE OTHERS AFTER THAT, HAS BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT.
HOWEVER, WE HAVE DISCUSSED ALL THE PROBLEMS AND THE GUERRILLAS WILL
LOGICALLY REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO SIT DOWN AT THE
TABLE.

   [REPORTER] THEY ASK FOR GUARANTEES FOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.

   [MERINO] I BELIEVE WE CANNOT GIVE THEM MORE GUARANTEES THAN THE
ONES WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THEM.  THERE IS A GENERAL FEELING THAT
THESE PEOPLE ONLY UNDERSTAND STRONG ACTIONS.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT
HAS REVIEWED THE SITUATION QUITE WELL, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO FALL
INTO THAT TRAP OR MAKE THAT MISTAKE.  OTHERWISE, WE WOULD GIVE THEM
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCUSE THE GOVERNMENT.  WE WILL LOGICALLY BE
PRUDENT.  [END RECORDING]

   VICE PRESIDENT MERINO SAID THAT DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES THE
GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE.  THE FMLN
GUERRILLAS WITHDREW FROM THE TALKS AND DEMANDED SECURITY FOR LABOR
UNION ORGANIZATIONS FOLLOWING THE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], IN WHICH 10 LABOR
UNION MEMBERS WERE KILLED, INCLUDING OPPOSITION LEADER ELIZABETH
VELAZQUEZ.

   NEXT WEEK, GUERRILLA LEADERS WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA WITH

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [EL
SALVADOR GOVERNMENT] [TEXT] CONCERNING THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] COMMUNIQUE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
HEREBY ANNOUNCES THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  ON THE DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], THE GOVERNMENT
STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO CARRY OUT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.  HOWEVER, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT FENASTRAS
LEADERS HAVE BEEN HINDERING THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT COULD CLEAR UP THE
ATTACK.

   NONETHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT REITERATES ITS DETERMINATION TO CARRY
OUT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, AND WILL EVEN BRING TO THE COUNTRY SOME
EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD SO THAT WITH THE HELP OF MODERN SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY THEY WILL HELP THE INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE CLARIFY THIS
BLOODY AND CRIMINAL ATTACK AND ESTABLISH WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.

   LIKEWISE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO APPOINT A COMMISSION THAT
WILL GUARANTEE THE INVESTIGATIONS, AND IT WILL INVITE THE FOLLOWING:
ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM
THE OAS; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SALVADORAN BISHOPS' CONFERENCE;
ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE POLITICAL PARTIES; TWO LABOR UNION
REPRESENTATIVES, ONE OF THEM BEING FROM FENASTRAS; DR IGNACIO
ELLACURIA [JESUIT PRIEST AND RECTOR OF THE JOSE SIMEON CANAS CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY]; THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC; AND THE
MINISTER OF JUSTICE.

   2.  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS SUPPLIED EVIDENCE FROM THE
BEGINNING THAT IT IS SINCERELY SEEKING PEACE.  THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION
ATTENDED A FIRST MEETING WITH THE FMLN IN MEXICO, AND ACCEPTED A
COMMITMENT, AS FOLLOWS, AND I QUOTE: BOTH PARTIES COMMIT THEMSELVES
NOT TO WITHDRAW UNILATERALLY FROM THE DIALOGUE.

   THE FMLN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DIALOGUE IS NOT ONLY A VIOLATION OF
THE MEXICO AGREEMENT, BUT ALSO [WORD INDISTINCT] THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE'S HOPES FOR PEACE.  FAR FROM SUSPENDING THE DIALOGUE, THE FMLN
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEARCH FOR PEACE IS NOW MORE NECESSARY THAN
EVER IN ORDER TO HALT THE BLOODSHED.

   3.  EVIDENTLY, IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS ONE, THE ENEMIES OF PEACE
ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE DIALOGUE FAIL.  THE RECENT TERRORIST ACTIONS
ARE AN INSULT TO THE CIVILIZED MECHANISMS THAT HAVE COME UP AT THE
NEGOTIATIONS TABLE.

   THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY NOTIFIES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE TO
DO ITS WORK, AND IT WILL NOT WITHDRAW FROM THE TALKS IN SPITE OF THE
SORROWFUL EVENTS THAT HAVE BROUGHT MORE MOURNING TO THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE IN RECENT DAYS.

   4.  IN THESE DIFFICULT MOMENTS THAT OUR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING,
THE GOVERNMENT REITERATES ITS CALL FOR THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM, SO
THAT IN A PRUDENT AND UNDERSTANDING MANNER WE WILL JOIN EFFORTS TO
HELP REACH PEACE AND NOT PROMOTE VIOLENCE, WHICH ONLY SERVES TO
 HINDER THE DIALOGUE.

   CLANDESTINE, 4 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, COMMANDER SALVADOR
SANCHEZ, ALIAS COMMANDER LEONEL GONZALEZ, MEMBER OF THE FMLN GENERAL
COMMAND, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] COMMANDER LEONEL
GONZALEZ, ON FRIDAY NIGHT MR ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED SOME MEASURES
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WILL ADOPT IN CONNECTION WITH FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION] AND THE DIALOGUE.  THE
FMLN ANNOUNCED IT HAD SUSPENDED ITS TRIP TO CARACAS, BUT CRISTIANI
SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION WILL GO TO CARACAS REGARDLESS OF
OUR DECISION.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION?

   [GONZALEZ] IN MY OPINION, TWO POSITIONS ON THE DIALOGUE AND THE
NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS WERE MADE EVIDENT IN SAN JOSE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND VIEW THE DIALOGUE
AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TALKING, BUYING TIME, AND BUILDING A GOOD IMAGE
FOR THEMSELVES.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FMLN IS WORKING FOR A REAL
NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.  THE FMLN HAS OPENED A BROADER DEBATE, A DEBATE
THAT INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS WITH AND THE PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL
PARTIES, THE SOCIAL FORCES, THE CHURCH, ALL THE SECTORS. WE HAVE
INITIATED A NATIONAL DIALOGUE.  AS WE SEE IT, THE GOAL IS PART OF A
WHOLE, IT IS NOT EVERYTHING.  THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF ALLOWING THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE SOCIAL FORCES IS IMPORTANT ALSO.

   IN RECENT DAYS WE HAVE SEEN ACTIONS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF
EL SALVADOR.  THERE WAS THE ATTACK ON WORKERS IN WHICH 10 WORKERS DIED
AND 31 WERE INJURED.  THE FMLN CANNOT IGNORE THIS FACT.  THIS IS PART
OF THE PROCESS.  WE HAVE SAID THAT WE ARE GOING TO ESTABLISH CONTACT
WITH OBSERVERS AND MEDIATORS TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION, AND WE WILL
DISCUSS THIS PROCESS WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE SOCIAL FORCES.
WHAT WE WANT IS TO CONSOLIDATE THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.  WE ARE NOT
TRYING TO ENHANCE OUR IMAGE; OUR PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

   IN SAN JOSE WE MADE A SOLUTION PROPOSAL THAT ENVISAGES DEMOCRACY,
HUMAN RIGHTS, AND A PROCESS TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT.  ON MONDAY AND WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK WE ARE GOING TO MEET
IN WASHINGTON WITH OAS AND UN REPRESENTATIVES.  ALSO ON MONDAY IN SAN
JOSE, COSTA RICA, WE COULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE COSTA RICAN
GOVERNMENT TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION.

   WE WILL ANALYZE DEVELOPMENTS TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  IF ACTIONS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT CLOSE
THE POSSIBILITIES OF CARACAS, THEN WE WILL ADOPT MEASURES.  WHAT WE
HAVE DONE IS TO ANNOUNCE A SUSPENSION TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR MAKING
PROGRESS TOWARD REAL NEGOTIATIONS, AS THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENTS
ESTABLISH.

   [REPORTER] THEN WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO CARACAS, COMMANDER?

   [GONZALEZ] I BELIEVE THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION GOING TO CARACAS IS AIMED AT ENHANCING THE GOVERNMENT'S
 IMAGE, AT CREATING A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE MASSACRE COMMITTED
AGAINST THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.

   [REPORTER] NOW THAT YOU MENTION THE FENASTRAS MASSACRE, WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE THAT
CRISTIANI HAS ANNOUNCED?

   [GONZALEZ] ONE OF THE POINTS OF OUR SAN JOSE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR
CHANGING THE SALVADORAN LEGAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS VITIATED AND IS IN
THE HANDS OF ONE SINGLE PARTY.  SO, IN THIS FRAMEWORK, CONDUCTING AN
INVESTIGATION IS LIKE PUTTING THE CASE INSIDE A FORGOTTEN DRAWER.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONSIGNOR ROMERO CASE, THE CASE OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, AND THE CASES OF THOUSANDS OF
WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED AND WHOSE CASES HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN.
THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMISSION IS TO CREATE A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE
GRAVE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BEING COMMITTED BY THE CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN INVITED TO FORM
PART OF THIS COMMISSION SHOULD NOT LEND THEMSELVES TO PLAYING A PART
IN THE EFFORT TO HIDE WHAT IS REALLY BEHIND ALL THIS.  WHAT THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WANTS IS TO DIVERT AWAY FROM EMILIO PONCE ALL THE
ACCUSATIONS AND CHARGES, AND PONCE IS THE ONE WHO IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED
IN THIS KIND OF ATTACK.  THE STATE POLICY OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
IS REPRESSION, AND THIS STATE POLICY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI, AND THE HIGH COMMAND, AND THEY ARE
DOING IT THROUGH THE REPRESSIVE BODIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY
FUNCTION AS CIVILIANS, AS DEATH SQUADS, OR IN UNIFORM.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, IN
ANALYZING RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN SAN SALVADOR, HAS REPORTED THAT
GROUPS OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT - REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT [FMLN -FDR] ALLIANCE COULD BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

   THE MILITARY COMMANDER WAS CAREFUL IN MAKING HIS STATEMENT.  HE
SAID THAT HE HAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THOSE GROUPS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
EXPLOSIONS IN THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION
[FENASTRAS] AND COMADRES [COMMITTEE OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES OF THE
PAST, THE ARMY HAS BEEN BLAMED, AND LATER IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THAT
FMLN TERRORISTS HAD CARRIED THEM OUT.

   ELENA FUENTES RECALLED THAT A FEW DAYS AGO THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION
ON THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND HE WENT THERE AND IT WAS
ESTABLISHED IN FRONT OF STUDENT LEADERS THAT THE EXPLOSION WAS CAUSED
BY A GRENADE THAT WENT OFF IN THE HANDS OF A YOUNG LEFTIST WHO WAS
HANDLING IT.  BY THEN, HOWEVER, STATEMENTS HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE
ACCUSING THE MILITARY.

   ELENA FUENTES ALSO REFERRED TO INTERNAL PURGES WITHIN COMMUNIST
GROUPS, PURGES LIKE THE CASE OF MELIDA ANAYA MONTES, ALIAS COMMANDER
MARIA; SALVADOR CAYETANO CARPIO, ALIAS MARCIAL; AND OTHERS.

   HE SAID: "IT WOULD NOT BE STRANGE TO FIND THAT THESE ACTIONS HAVE
BEEN THE RESULT OF A PURGE OR A DIVERSIONARY TACTIC BY THE COMMUNISTS
TO ATTRACT POLITICAL ATTENTION AND GAIN THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT, WHICH
EVERYBODY BELIEVES THEY ARE LOSING."

   IT WAS RECALLED, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THAT THE NAME OF ONE OF THE
VICTIMS OF THE FENASTRAS ATTACK, FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, WAS
MENTIONED IN THE INVESTIGATIONS BEING CARRIED OUT BY INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS OVER THE EMBEZZLEMENT OF AID FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
THAT WAS TO BENEFIT THE MOST NEEDY PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT THAT
ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF TERRORIST GROUPS TO BE USED FOR TERRORIST
PURPOSES.

   ELENA FUENTES STATED: "TIME AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL TELL WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED."

   HE SAID THAT THE PURPOSE OF THESE ATTACKS, ESPECIALLY THE ONE ON
THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, FOR WHICH THE FMLN - FDR CLAIMED CREDIT, AS WELL
AS THE ATTACKS ON COMADRES AND FENASTRAS, WAS TO GIVE THE FMLN - FDR
LEADERSHIP JUSTIFICATION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE DIALOGUE.

   ELENA FUENTES SAID THAT THE TERRORIST GUADALUPE MARTINEZ SAID IN
MANAGUA YESTERDAY THAT THE LEFTIST LEADERSHIP IS CONSIDERING NOT GOING
TO THE DIALOGUE MEETINGS BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] IT HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THIS
CAPITAL THAT A DELEGATION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) WILL MEET THIS WEEK IN WASHINGTON WITH UN AND OAS
REPRESENTATIVES TO ANALYZE THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION AND THE FUTURE OF
THE TALKS BETWEEN THE REBELS AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION.

   COMMANDER LEONEL GONZALEZ, ONE OF THE FIVE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND
MEMBERS, ISSUED A STATEMENT THROUGH RADIO VENCEREMOS -- THE OFFICIAL
VOICE OF THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS -- AND SAID THAT THE MEETINGS
WILL START TOMORROW 6 NOVEMBER.

   OTHER FMLN DELEGATES WILL MEET TOMORROW WITH COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT
OSCAR ARIAS, WHO HAS STATED HIS CONCERN REGARDING THE TALKS BETWEEN
THE REBELS AND CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AFTER RIGHT-WING SQUADS
ASSASSINATED 10 LABOR LEADERS.

   COMMANDER GONZALEZ SAID "THAT THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION'S
DOUBLE-FACED CONDUCT IS PRECLUDING THE POSSIBILITIES FOR ACHIEVING A
PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT."

   "THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION AND THE ARMY OPPOSE REAL
NEGOTIATIONS, AND THEIR CONCEPT OF A DIALOGUE IS TO TALK AND TALK --
BUT ONLY TO GAIN TIME AND PROJECT A GOOD IMAGE AT THE NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL," THE REBEL LEADER SAID.

   REFERRING TO THIS, GONZALEZ ASSERTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION
TO SEND ITS DELEGATION TO THE 20-21 NOVEMBER MEETING IN CARACAS,
WHETHER THE GUERRILLA REPRESENTATIVES ATTEND IT OR NOT, IS AIMED AT
"CREATING A SMOKE SCREEN TO COVER THE MASSACRES PERPETRATED THIS WEEK
AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT."

   COMMANDER GONZALEZ ALSO REFERRED TO CRISTIANI'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A
COMMISSION WILL BE CREATED WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF UN AND OAS
DELEGATES TO INVESTIGATE THE 10 LABOR LEADERS' MASSACRE.

   "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN INVESTIGATION WITH A CORRUPT
JUDICIAL SYSTEM LIKE THE ONE IN EL SALVADOR ," GONZALEZ SAID.  HE
RECALLED THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THE MURDER
OF SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO IN 10 YEARS.  THE
GUERRILLA BLAMES MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT
PARTY'S IDEOLOGISTS, FOR ROMERO'S MURDER.

   THE FMLN COMMANDER ALSO WARNED THAT THE ARMY "HAS LAUNCHED A
CAMPAIGN TO CONFUSE NATIONAL AND WORLD OPINION BY ACCUSING THE
GUERRILLAS OF PERPETRATING TERRORIST ACTIONS."

   THE ARMED FORCES ACTUALLY WANT "TO COVER UP THEIR REPRESSIVE POLICY
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHIFTED FROM SELECTIVE ARRESTS TO MASS ARRESTS --
AND FROM GENOCIDE TO INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS," HE ADDED.

   THE GUERRILLA COMMANDER ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE GUERRILLA FORCES
WILL MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF MILITARY ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
AS LONG AS THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING A REAL DIALOGUE -
NEGOTIATION PROCESS WHICH LEADS THE COUNTRY TO AN EVERLASTING PEACE.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 5 OCT 89 (RADIO PEACE AND PROGRESS) -- [COMMENTARY]
[MARINA PETROVSKAYA] [TEXT] THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS
APPROVED BY A MAJORITY VOTE AN ANTI-NICARAGUAN RESOLUTION WHICH GRANTS
$4 MILLION WORTH OF SO-CALLED HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE CONTRAS.
ANALYST MARINA PETROVSKAYA DISCUSSES THE SUBJECT.

   THIS RESOLUTION IN ESSENCE ALLOWS THE CONTINUATION OF THE DIRTY WAR
AGAINST NICARAGUA.  THE SOMOSA FORCES HAVE LATELY INCREASED THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF NICARAGUA BY KILLING CIVILIANS
AND SANDINIST SOLDIERS.  AS WITNESSED BY THE [WORD INDISTINCT], THIS
HAS NOT HAPPENED BY CHANCE.  MANY CONTRAS TURNED THEMSELVES INTO THE
NICARAGUAN AUTHORITIES WHEN AND AMNESTY WAS DECLARED.  THEY ADMITTED
THAT THEY RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THEIR LEADERS IN HONDURAS TO CROSS THE
BORDER AND, BY MEANS OF TERROR AND THREAT, FORCED CIVILIANS TO VOTE
FOR THE OPPOSITION CANDIDATES.

   SUPRISINGLY, THE SOMOSA FORCES HAVE NOT AIMED AT MORE AMBITIOUS
GOALS.  INSTEAD OF BEING CONDEMNED BY WASHINGTON THEY ARE RECEIVING
COMPLEMENTARY AID FROM IT.  CURIOUSLY, THIS NEW [WORD INDISTINCT] FOR
THE CONTRAS COINCIDES WITH THE GRANTING OF $9 MILLION TO FINANCE THE
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN OF THE NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION, JUST WHEN MRS VIOLETA
DE CHAMORRO HAS RECEIVED $3 MILLION FOR HERSELF.

   SUCH US GOVERNMENT AID FOR THE NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST SECTORS ALARMS
THE NICARAGUAN AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES.  ELECTIONS WILL BE
HELD IN NICARAGUA IN A FEW MONTHS FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL
DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS WHICH IS BEING CONDUCTED IN KEEPING WITH THE
COMMITMENTS ASSUMED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS FROM GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.

   THIS DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS CANNOT BE NORMAL SINCE CONFRONTATIONS
BETWEEN CONTRAS AND [WORD INDISTINCT] ARE INCREASING, AND THESE ARE
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UNITED STATES.  AS IS KNOWN, THE SANDINIST
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SUSPEND THE CESSATION OF MILITARY
OPERATION AGAINST THE SOMOSA FORCES, WHICH HAD BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE
MAY 1988.

   MEANWHILE, WASHINGTON HAS ACCUSED THE SANDINISTS OF VIOLATING
DEMOCRACY AND OF HINDERING A [WORD INDISTINCT] POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] SUCH AN EVALUATION OF THE SANDINIST ACTION IS
UNJUST IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE REGION, INCLUDING
NICARAGUA, IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE
CONFLICT MAKE AN EFFORT, NOT JUST ONE.

   LOOK AT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR THESE DAYS.  IT LOOKED LIKE
THE CONDITIONS FOR A CEASE-FIRE HAD IMPROVED AND THIS IS WHY WE
APPLAUDED THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT [WORDS INDISTINCT].
BUT THE PROGRESS MADE WAS REJECTED BY THE RIGHTIST GROUPS WHICH
REFUSED TO HOLD CONSTRUCTIVE NEGOTIATIONS.  THIS IS WHY THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] REFUSES TO HOLD THE THIRD
ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CHANGE THEIR OLD
METHODS OF SOLVING INTERNAL PROBLEMS WITHOUT GUARANTEEING THE SECURITY
OF THE LEFTIST FORCES.

   IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EVENTS TAKING PLACE IN NICARAGUA AND EL
SALVADOR ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THE PEACE EFFORTS IN THE TWO COUNTRIES
ARE BEING OBSTRUCTED BY MILITARY FORCES FINANCED BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT, WHICH CONTINUES TO KEEP A HEATED ENVIRONMENT IN THOSE
COUNTRIES AND TO LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS FROM A POSITION OF FORCE.

TOWN OF QUINCHIA, ABOUT 300 KM WEST OF BOGOTA, IN THE COFFEE-GROWING
DEPARTMENT OF RISARALDA, QUINCHIA MAYOR SAUL BOTERO HAS REPORTED.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE 8TH ARMY BRIGADE SAID THAT THE ATTACK WAS
APPARENTLY THE WORK OF GUERRILLAS OF THE MAOIST POPULAR LIBERATION

LOCATED AT VEREDA LA UNION, A FEW KILOMETERS FROM QUINCHIA.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 7 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] POLICE SOURCES REPORTED TODAY
THAT JORGE CASTILLO GARCIA, NICARAGUAN CONSUL IN COSTA RICA, WHO CAME
HERE TO PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS, WAS SERIOUSLY
INJURED. HE WAS SHOT ON THE EVENING OF 5 NOVEMBER AT A TEGUCIGALPA
RESTAURANT.

   ARNALDO AMADOR, SECURITY GUARD AT THE DOMOS RESTAURANT TOLD POLICE
THAT CASTILLO, VISIBLY DRUNK, TRIED TO TAKE A MOTORCYCLE FROM IN FRONT
OF THE RESTAURANT. AMADOR ORDERED CASTILLO TO SURRENDER, BELIEVING HE
WAS A THIEF.

   ACCORDING TO AMADOR THE NICARAGUAN CONSUL ATTACKED HIM, HITTING HIM
ON THE HEAD. AMADOR SAYS HE THEN SHOT CASTILLO WITH HIS SUBMACHINEGUN,
WOUNDING HIM IN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CHEST, VERY NEAR THE HEART.

   CASTILLO GARCIA WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE IS NOW
"RECOVERING", WHILE AMADOR HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY THE POLICE.

   A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE INCIDENT, WHICH OCCURRED AT 2200 ON 5
NOVEMBER, DONAL OLIVA, SECRETARY OF THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY HERE, CAME
TO THE RESTAURANT TO GET DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT.

   OLIVA SAID THAT CASTILLO GARCIA HAD LEFT THE EMBASSY ABOUT 2 HOURS
BEFORE.  HE SAID THAT CASTILLO HAD ARRIVED IN HONDURAS LAST WEEK TO
PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS, ESTABLISHED ALONG THE
NICARAGUAN BORDER.

   MOSCOW (USSR), NO DATE (RADIO MAGALLANES) -- [STATEMENT] [CHILEAN
COMMUNIST PARTY] [TEXT] THE COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING ONE OF THE WORST
ANTICOMMUNIST AND TERRORIST CAMPAIGNS IN A LONG TIME. THIS CAMPAIGN IS
SIMILAR TO THE ONE UNLEASHED BETWEEN 1964 AND 1970.  THE SITUATION IS
FURTHER AGGRAVATED BECAUSE IT IS TAKING PLACE UNDER A DICTATORSHIP
THAT WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES.

   DURING HIS SPEECH IN COIHAIQUE, PINOCHET THREATENED TO END THE
STATE OF LAW.  THIS HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY OTHER THREATS BY [DEPUTY
OPPONENTS, AND BY EQUALLY THREATENING STATEMENTS AND SYSTEMATIC
AGGRESSION AGAINST ARMY MEMBERS WHO CRITICIZE THE DICTATORIAL REGIME.

   MEANWHILE EL MERCURIO AND THE PROGOVERNMENT NEWS MEDIA HAVE
ORCHESTRATED A CAMPAIGN THAT IS FINANCED BY BUCHI'S ELECTORAL
MANAGERS. THIS CAMPAIGN USES EDITORIALS, ATTRIBUTED ARTICLES, AND PAID
ADS THAT ARE AIMED AT MISINFORMING AND MANIPULATING PUBLIC OPINION.

   THE OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE A MOOD OF AGGRESSION TOWARD THE LEFT AND
TOWARD THE COMMUNIST PARTY, A MOOD THAT WOULD JUSTIFY ANY KIND OF
PROVOCATION.

   THE WORST EXAMPLE WAS A RECENT PAID AD PUBLISHED BY BUCHI'S
ELECTORAL MANAGERS ON AN ALLEGED THREAT OF COMMUNIST STRIKE SQUADS
THAT WERE GOING TO GUN DOWN THE PROGOVERNMENT CANDIDATE. IT IS WELL
KNOWN THAT THIS STATEMENT, REPORTEDLY MADE BY A YOUNG CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER TO LA SEGUNDA ON 31 OCTOBER, WAS LATER FLATLY
DENIED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC LEADER HIMSELF.  DESPITE THIS
DENIAL, BUCHI'S CAMPAIGN MANAGERS ARE STILL HARPING ON THE SUBJECT,
TRYING TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF VIOLENCE AND UNEASE.

   THE BRUTAL MURDER OF JECAR NEGHME, UNSOLVED LIKE SO MANY OTHERS,
HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY OTHER SERIOUS EVENTS INCLUDING THE KIDNAPPING OF
THE DRIVER OF VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY. THIS WAS A THREAT TO COMRADE VOLODIA TEITELBOIM'S
SAFETY AND PHYSICAL INTEGRITY. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN HARASSMENT OF
LEADERS AND CANDIDATES OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND OTHER DEMOCRATIC
PARTIES, AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ARBITRARY ARRESTS OF OPPONENTS
IN GENERAL, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW JOINT COMMAND HEADED BY THE
DEFENSE MINISTER. THE ALLEGED OBJECTIVE OF THIS COMMAND IS TO FIGHT
CRIME, BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE RIGHTLY GUESSED THAT IT IS A COVER FOR
POLITICAL REPRESSION SIMILAR TO THAT CONDUCTED BY A PRIOR ORGANIZATION
THAT BORE THE SAME NAME.

   IN THIS ANTICOMMUNIST AND ANTIDEMOCRATIC ATMOSPHERE, MEETINGS HAVE
BEEN HELD WITH OFFICERS AND RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN. DURING THESE
MEETINGS THE AUDIENCE IS MISINFORMED, THREATENED, AND URGED TO OPPOSE
DEMOCRATIC CHANGES.  THEY ARE ALSO URGED TO HOARD STAPLES AND TO TAKE
SPECIAL MEASURES TO PROVIDE FOR EXTREME CONTINGENCIES.

   THERE IS YET ANOTHER ESPECIALLY SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT ABOUT WHICH WE
WANT TO INFORM THE PEOPLE.  WE HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS
SOURCES TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CROWNING POINT OF THIS ANTICOMMUNIST
CAMPAIGN WILL BE AN ATTACK ON A HIGH-RANKING ARMY OFFICER WHO HAS BEEN
CRITICIZED FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN HUMAN-RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  THE
CHARGES AGAINST THIS OFFICER MADE BY COMMUNIST PARTY CANDIDATES FOR
SENATORS, AND THE DEMONSTRATIONS HELD AGAINST HIM BY THE RELATIVES OF
THE VICTIMS, WILL BE USED TO BLAME THE COMMUNISTS FOR THIS ATTACK.

   WE WANT TO REITERATE OUR ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS AND OUR DEMAND FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE. HOWEVER, WE ALSO WANT
TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING TO HAVE EVERY CRIME AND EVERY
VIOLATION INVESTIGATED AND THE CULPRITS TRIED.

   THE ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE IS AIMED AT
TWISTING THE POPULAR WILL OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE AND DESTABILIZING IN
ADVANCE THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION.

   WE CALL UPON THE CITIZENRY TO BE PREPARED TO DISPLAY UNITY AND
DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION SO AS TO GUARANTEE THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF
THE ONGOING ELECTORAL PROCESS AND TO BE ON GUARD AGAINST ANY
PROVOCATION AIMED AT CREATING A CLIMATE FAVORABLE TO AN INTERRUPTION
OF THE PROCESS.  WE MUST DEPLOY OUR FORCES IF WE ARE TO ENSURE THE
VICTORY OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY IN A LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR PATRICIO
AYLWIN ON 14 DECEMBER AND THE ELECTION OF A CONGRESS CAPABLE OF
GUARANTEEING PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THAT MOST CHILEANS
WANT.

   CLANDESTINE, 7 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
VENANCIO SALVATIERRA, WITH NOM DE GUERRE OF MARIO LOPEZ, A COMMANDER
OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [SALVATIERRA] FROM THIS
STANDPOINT, THE PROPOSAL BROUGHT BY THE CHRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION TO SAN JOSE SOUGHT TO GAIN TIME WHILE KEEPING THE IMAGE
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE.  HOWEVER, THE
GOVERNMENT WAS NOT REALLY SEEKING THE PATH TOWARD A NEGOTIATION.  ON
THE CONTRARY, IT SOUGHT TO CONDUCT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE DIALOGUE
ACTIONS THAT WILL GIVE IT AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE FMLN, INCLUDING
TERRORIST ATTACKS LIKE THIS ONE.  THE OPERATION AGAINST THE FENASTRAS
LEADERSHIP IS PART OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT POLICY, AND SO IS THE
WAVE OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE MASS MOVEMENT FROM THE ONSET OF THIS
GOVERNMENT.

   THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED IN COSTA RICA INCLUDED MASS GROUPS AS PART
OF THE ENEMY.  ALL THESE THINGS ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT POLICY.  WE
CANNOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO HIDE THIS POLICY BEHIND THE DIALOGUE,
AS THIS POLICY ALLOWS ACTIONS LIKE THE ONE AT FENASTRAS TO GO
UNPUNISHED AND DO NOT LEAD TO A TRUE SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT.  THAT
IS WHY THE FMLN SUSPENDED ITS PARTICIPATION IN CARACAS, BUT HAS NOT
SUSPENDED ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE.  IN FACT, THE FMLN HAS
UNDERTAKEN BIDS TO CONDUCT A MEDIATION SO THAT THE ADEQUATE CONDITIONS
FOR A DIALOGUE ARE CREATED AND ACTIONS LIKE THE ONE IN FENASTRAS DO
NOT CONTINUE.  DEEP DOWN, WE FEEL THAT IN ORDER FOR THE DIALOGUE TO
TURN INTO A NEGOTIATION THAT WILL END THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT...[CHANGES THOUGHT] THE PROGRESS OF THE MASS MOVEMENT IN EL
SALVADOR WITH ALL THE EXISTING FORMS OF STRUGGLE IS WHAT WILL COMPEL
THE OTHER SIDE TO REALLY SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATIONS TABLE.

   SO LONG AS THE OTHER SIDE FEELS THAT IT CAN DEFEAT THE PEOPLE, IT
WILL NOT BE TRULY COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATING AN END TO THE CONFLICT.
WHEN IT SEES THAT THE PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT IT, AND THAT IT IS FORCED TO
NEGOTIATE, THEN A NEGOTIATION WILL TRULY TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ, THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS, EVEN
FOLLOWING THE FENASTRAS ATTACK, INDICATE THAT GOVERNMENT POLICY DOES
NOT SEEM TO CHANGE REGARDING THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND THREATS
TO THE MASS MOVEMENT.  IN FACT, THE LUTHERAN CHURCH, OR RATHER ITS
PASTOR LEARDO GOMEZ, HAS RECEIVED DEATH THREATS.  DO YOU THINK AN
INTERNAL PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES IS POSSIBLE?  DO YOU THINK THAT
WITH THAT INTERNAL PURGE IT CAN BE POSSIBLE TO STOP THE EXTREME HUMAN
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE COUNTRY?

   [SALVATIERRA] THE FMLN HAS PROPOSED AN INTERNAL PURGE IN THE ARMED
FORCES AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE OR
NEGOTIATIONS, MEANING THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES MUST GET RID OF
THE CORRUPT AND CRIMINAL ELEMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE CRUX OF THE MATTER IS
THE NEED TO PURGE THE ARMED FORCES.  THE FMLN HAS TOLD THEM: PURGE
YOURSELVES.  HOWEVER, THAT IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.  ON ONE SIDE,
THE NEED TO HAVE A TRUE PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES BECOMES APPARENT,
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE CANNOT MAKE PROGRESS AND HAVE TRUE DEMOCRACY IN
OUR COUNTRY.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ARE PROVING THE FMLN IS RIGHT.  ON
THE OTHER SIDE, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENTS CONTROL THE
MILITARY POWER AND HAVE INFLUENCE OVER THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL POWER.

   THE PRESENCE OF LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATES OF THE
CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY SCHOOL] IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION
CAMERAS, FOLLOWING THE DIALOGUE SESSION IN COSTA RICA, WAS MEANT TO
TELL THE PEOPLE: WE RULE AND CAN DO AS WE PLEASE.  THEN THE ATTACKS
CAME.  I FEEL THAT THE NEED TO END THAT SITUATION IS EVIDENT TO ALL,
AS WELL AS HOW RIGHT THE FMLN STAND IS.  I NOW WANT TO REITERATE THAT
WE CANNOT ACHIEVE THAT GOAL UNLESS WE FORCE THE ARMED FORCES AND THE
GOVERNMENT TO CARRY OUT THAT PURGE.  BY FORCING THEM, I MEAN THAT THE
PEOPLE'S FORCE MUST TELL THEM TO DO THAT IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE.  THE
DEMAND THAT COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF
STAFF] LEAVE, AS HE IS ONE OF THE CHIEF CULPRITS OF THE
ABOVE-MENTIONED POLICY, WILL GROW STRONGER.  THE PEOPLE MUST PRESS AND
ARE PRESSING THIS DEMAND.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ,
FOLLOWING RECENT INCIDENTS AND TERRORIST ACTIONS SUCH AS THE ATTACK ON
FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], THE U.S.
OFFICIAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS
BERNARD ARONSON CAME TO OUR COUNTRY.  HE SAID THAT U.S. ASSISTANCE
WILL DEPEND [WORDS INDISTINCT]. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HIS VISIT TO
OUR COUNTRY?

   [SALVATIERRA] IT IS BASICALLY AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S PRESTIGE
AND IMAGE, AS THIS HAS BEEN A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY NEED A POTABLE IMAGE, AN IMAGE
THAT PORTRAYS LEGITIMACY, AND AN IMAGE OF MODERATION THAT WILL NOT
ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT INTERNATIONALLY. THE FENASTRAS INCIDENT
UNDOUBTEDLY UNMASKED CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. THEREFORE, ARONSON'S
VISIT IS AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S IMAGE AND SUPPORTING CRISTIANI'S
INITIATIVE OF CREATING A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THOSE INCIDENTS, IN
ORDER TO FOSTER HOPES AND CREDIBILITY AMONG SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE
GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST IN CLARIFYING THE INCIDENTS. THAT WAS ARONSON'S
INTENTION.

   AS A MATTER OF FACT, CRISTIANI'S IMAGE IS IMPORTANT FOR THE AID
ITSELF. ASPECTS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN
THE DEBATES AT THE U.S. CONGRESS, WHERE THE AID IS APPROVED.
THEREFORE, THAT AID WOULD BE ENDANGERED IF THE DEBATES ON VIOLATIONS
OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR ARE INTENSIFIED. IT COULD HAVE AN
EFFECT ON THAT. SO WHAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO SAVE IS THE AID TO
CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE WAR.

   IN THAT REGARD, WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THAT WITHIN THE DOCTRINE OF
LOW INTENSITY WARFARE, THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY
PLAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT WILL NOT APPEAR TO
BE IN THE EXTREME RIGHT; A GOVERNMENT THAT APPEARS TO BE MORE IN THE
CENTER THAN IN THE EXTREME RIGHT, IN ORDER TO CREATE EXPECTATIONS
WITHIN SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT'S CREDIBILITY, AND ALSO AT
THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. WHILE TRYING TO DEFEAT THE REBELS MILITARILY
AND THROUGH REPRESSION, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE
IMAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT.

   [REPORTER] YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE FMLN'S POLITICAL-DIPLOMATIC
COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THE FENASTRAS INCIDENTS, OUR FRONT
CANCELLED ITS ATTENDANCE AT THE CARACAS MEETING. WHAT ARE THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR RESTORING THE TALKS AND CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE -
NEGOTIATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT?

   [SALVATIERRA] THE FMLN IS INTERESTED IN A REAL DIALOGUE, A DIALOGUE
THAT WILL LEAD TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT; IN OTHER
WORDS, A DIALOGUE THAT WILL LEAD TO NEGOTIATIONS.  WE DIFFER WITH
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT ON THIS.  FROM THE BEGINNING, ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] HAS EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO
PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE, BUT NOT TO NEGOTIATE.  THEY HAVE A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT CONCEPT.  [CONTINUED]

SALVADORAN LEFTIST SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT (MPSC) HAVE BEEN
KILLED BY ARMY SOLDIERS IN THE CITY OF SONSONATE, APPROXIMATELY 50 KM
WEST OF SAN SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THAT POLITICAL
ORGANIZATION.

   AMONG THE VICTIMS ARE CECILIO RIVERA, WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MPSC
ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN EASTERN SONSONATE DEPARTMENT.  RIVERA WAS
SHOT TO DEATH ALONG WITH TWO OTHER PARTY MILITANTS WHOSE IDENTITIES
WERE NOT REVEALED.  JUAN JOSE MARTEL, A TOP MPSC LEADER, TOLD AFP THAT
AFTER LEAVING THE ORGANIZATION'S OFFICE ON THE NIGHT OF 6 NOVEMBER,
THREE MEMBERS WERE ARRESTED BY "A GROUP OF ARMED SOLDIERS IN CIVILIAN
CLOTHES BELONGING TO SONSONATE'S MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6.

   "WE HAVE LEARNED OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY THESE SAME
INDIVIDUALS AND HAVE APPEARED IN THE GARRISON LATER ON.  THEREFORE, WE
HAVE NO DOUBT THAT ARMY SOLDIERS KILLED THEM," HE ADDED.

   MARTEL EXPLAINED THAT THE THREE BODIES WERE FOUND ON TUESDAY NEAR
THE CITY'S CEMETERY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BURIED BY LOCAL
AUTHORITIES AS UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS.  HE NOTED THAT, BY CHANCE, A
NEIGHBOR IDENTIFIED RIVERA, AND THIS ALLOWED HIM TO SPREAD THE NEWS.

   THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRIPLE CRIME LEFT A PIECE OF PAPER ON THE
BODIES WHICH READ: "BECAUSE THEY BETRAYED THE FATHERLAND."

   CONDEMNING THIS MURDER, MARTEL SAID THAT "THIS NEW ACTION SHOWS,
ONCE MORE, THAT IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY AND NO RESPECT
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE DEATH SQUADS CONTINUE TO OPERATE."

   ON 19 OCTOBER, SUSPECTED DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS STAGED A BOMB ATTACK

   SANTIAGO, 3 NOV 89 (EL MERCURIO) -- [TEXT] THE LAUTARO POPULAR
REBEL FORCES [FRPL] AND THE LAUTARO YOUTH MOVEMENT [MJL] HELD THEIR
CLANDESTINE PLENARY SESSION IN SANTIAGO 5 MONTHS AGO.  ONE OF THE
DECISIONS ADOPTED DURING THE SESSION WAS TO RECRUIT MINORS, SHANTYTOWN
YOUTHS, AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS "TO FIGHT A GUERRILLA WAR IN CHILE,
BECAUSE THEY HAVE PLENTY OF MOTIVATION."

   THIS POLICY IS OUTLINED IN DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS THAT THOSE
TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE CIRCULATED IN SHANTYTOWNS AND AMONG THEIR
MEMBERS.  SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS HAVE BEEN SEIZED FROM
BOYS WHO WERE ARRESTED ON CHARGES OF BEING DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN
LOOTING OF COMMERCIAL PREMISES AND IN THE BLOODY MURDERS OF
CARABINEROS PERSONNEL.

   SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS SAY THAT "SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ARE OUR
STRATEGIC ALLIES," AND THAT THE MOVEMENTS IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH
"THE REVOLUTIONARY FORM OF STRUGGLE AND WITH THE STRUGGLE IN THE
TRENCHES THAT CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND EL SALVADOR HAVE USED" TO REMAIN IN
THE FOREFRONT OF LATIN AMERICAN SOCIALISM.

   THE TWO TERRORIST MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT "SEIZURE" OF LAND,
LOOTINGS, OCCUPATION OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND "THE RECOVERY OF
FIREARMS" ARE THE MAIN TACTICS TO BE UNDERTAKEN BY THE MASSES IN ORDER
TO "GAIN ELBOW ROOM."

   IN THE DOCUMENTS, THE MOVEMENTS ADVOCATE THE DISSEMINATION OF
VIOLENCE WITHIN THE MASSES, THE ADOPTION OF DEFENSIVE MEASURES IN
ORDER TO BEGIN AN OFFENSIVE, AND "A WAR BY EVERYONE" AS AN INEVITABLE
STEP FOR TAKING OVER THE COUNTRY.

   THE MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT "THE FACT THAT THE REBEL ELEMENTS HAVE
DISCOVERED THEIR OWN GEOGRAPHICAL ZONE, THE POWER OF THE MASSES, AND
THE MASSIVE POTENTIAL OF YOUTHS, IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS OF
THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT."

   THE DOCUMENTS EMPHASIZE THE TERRORIST ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE
MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT [FPMR] AND BY THE MOVEMENT OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY LEFT [MIR], STRESSING THAT THE MJL AND THE FRPL ARE THE
TWO OTHER CHILEAN EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS THAT "IMPLEMENT THE POLICY
OF THE VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTION."

   AS FOR THE SO-CALLED "WAR BY EVERYONE," THE DOCUMENTS POINTS OUT
THAT "IN THE CHILEAN VERSION, THERE ARE IRREGULAR FORCES WITH TRAINING
IN SUBVERSIVE TACTICS AND STRATEGY."

   THE MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT THEIR MEMBERS OPERATE IN THE STREETS,
IN EDUCATION AND LABOR CENTERS, IN HIGH SCHOOLS, AND IN SHANTYTOWNS,
ADDING THAT "THE TACTICAL SEQUENCE OF ACTION AMONG THE MASSES SHOULD
BEGIN AND END WITH POPULAR UPRISINGS, WHICH LEAD TO A HIGHER STAGE OF
TRANSITION TOWARD "THE PEOPLE IN FLAMES" OR "THE PEOPLE IN ARMS."

   THE MOVEMENTS ADMIT THAT "THE ART OF REVOLUTION CONSISTS OF
AWAKENING THE AMBITION FOR POWER BY TEACHING THE MASSES TO DREAM OF
SOMETHING ELSE."

   ANOTHER PARAGRAPH OF THE LENGTHY DOCUMENTS STATES THAT: "WE DO NOT
DENY THE NEED TO REACH POLITICAL ACCORDS", WHICH WE -- AS A MATTER OF
PRINCIPLE --COMPLY WITH, BECAUSE "THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ADOPT A POSITION
OF INDEPENDENCE AND OF INITIATIVE IN THE OFFENSIVE, BECAUSE THE
REVOLUTIONS ARE FOUGHT IN THE STREETS AND IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF
THE COUNTRY."

   CONCERNING THE CREATION OF THE TWO MOVEMENTS (BEGINNING IN 1983),
THE DOCUMENTS STATE THAT "OUR POLITICAL-MILITARY PROPOSAL TAKES ROOT
IN THE "WAR BY EVERYONE," A SYSTEM WHICH SOCIALIST COUNTRIES AND
TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTIONS HAVE USED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM
IMPERIALISM.  THE MOST INTENSE EXPRESSION OF THIS POLICY HAS BEEN
REFLECTED BY THE VIETNAMESE REVOLUTION, BY THE SUSTAINED STRUGGLE IN
EL SALVADOR, AND BY THE RESISTANCE TO THE SPANISH INVASION BY THE
MAPUCHE PEOPLE, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF LAUTARO.

HOW TO OBTAIN WEAPONS

   IN A DOCUMENT DEALING WITH THE "REVOLTIONARY PROGRAM FOR CHILE,"
THE MOVEMENTS CLAIM THAT "OUR WEAPONS ARE OBTAINED THROUGH THE
PEOPLE'S INITIATIVE, THROUGH WEAPON SEIZURES FROM THE ENEMY (THIS IS A
CLEAR ALLUSION TO THE MURDER OF CARABINEROS, WHOSE ARMS THEY SEIZE),
AND THROUGH INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY."

   THE DOCUMENTS EMPHASIZE "THE OFFENSIVE WAR WHICH WE ARE NOW WAGING
SEEKS TO ASPHYXIATE THE ENEMY, OVERWHELM IT, AND IMPEDE ITS INITIATIVE
AND THE CONCENTRATION OF ITS FORCES.  WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO CAUSE AS
MUCH DESTRUCTIVE DAMAGE TO THE ENEMY AS POSSIBLE."

   THE TERRORISTS CALL ON "YOUTHS TO WAGE THIS REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE
ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS," ADDING THAT "EVEN THOUGH THE HEAVIEST BURDEN
RESTS ON THE CITIES, THE COUNTRY AND RURAL AREAS ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE
INSTALLATION OF STRATEGIC FACILITIES."

   THE REPORT ON THE FIRST NATIONAL PLENUM (WHICH IS DATED MAY 1989)
HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DEDICATED TO "ALL HIGH SCHOOL AND MID-LEVEL
STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN RECRUITED BY OUR GROUPS."

   AMONG THE SLOGANS INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENTS, WHICH THE LAUTARO
MOVEMENT MEMBERS WILL USE THIS YEAR, ARE PHRASES LIKE "WE ARE A NEW
REVOLUTIONARY GENERATION," "WE ARE HAPPY, WE ARE REBEL, WE ARE ARMED,
AND THIS IS HOW WE WILL CARRY OUT THE REVOLUTION," "THE FATHERLAND FOR
THE PEOPLE," AND "FREE LOVE AND GUERRILLA."

   AFTER OUTLINING THE EIGHT TACTICAL OPERATIONS WHICH MAKE UP "THE
REVOLUTIONARY COURSE FOR THE MASSES WHO WILL FACE THE POLITICAL BREAK"
DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR, THE TWO MOVEMENTS STATE THAT "WE TOTAL
APPROXIMATELY 500,000 ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND SINCE 1983 WE HAVE
FOUGHT IN MORE THAN 30 TERRITORIES AND FRONTS."

   FINALLY, AS PART OF A SERIES OF CLEAR TERRORIST INSTRUCTIONS, THEY
CLAIM THAT THEY WORK "IN COORDINATION WITH THE FPMR AND WITH THE
MIR,"SO THAT "WITH THE YOUTH, THE PEOPLE, THE ARMS, AND THE IDEAS, WE
MAY TAKE OVER CHILE."

   NO CITY (HONDURAS), 8 NOV 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH AZCONA BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] NICARAGUA SAYS
THAT THE HONDURAN ARMY IS MOVING THE CONTRAS TO OLANCHO THIS WEEK SO
THEY WILL ESCAPE INSPECTION BY [WORD INDISTINCT].

   [AZCONA] NO, NO, NO. THE HONDURAN ARMY HAS NO RELATIONSHIP, NO
CONTACTS, WITH THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES.  [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF CARLOS FLORES'
SPEECH IN...[CHANGES THOUGHT] WHICH HAS BEEN SEVERELY CRITICIZED BY
SOME AND PRAISED BY OTHERS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [AZCONA] I THINK IT WAS A GOOD SPEECH. IT IS DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH
WHAT I HAVE SAID; THAT IS, THAT THE IMF'S PRESCRIPTIONS CANNOT BE
ACCEPTED AND APPLIED TO THIS COUNTRY, FOR INSTANCE, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE
WILL NOT PUT UP WITH MEASURES LIKE THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY
THE IMF AND ENDORSED BY HONDURAN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ABOUT FLORES' STATEMENTS SAYING THAT RELATIONS WITH
THE UNITED STATES WILL BE DIFFERENT IN HIS GOVERNMENT?

   [AZCONA] I DO NOT KNOW. THE RELATIONS WITH MY GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN
RELATIONS OF TOTAL UNITY. I THINK HE WAS NOT REFERRING TO THIS
ADMINISTRATION. HE MUST HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO A PREVIOUS

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [AZCONA] NO. I AM NOT BEING PRESSURED. WHAT I SAID THE OTHER DAY
HAS BEEN MISINTERPRETED. WHEN I SAID I NEEDED OXYGEN, IT WAS NOT
OXYGEN THAT NEWSMEN, OR BUSINESSMEN, OR INTELLECTUALS WERE GOING TO
GIVE ME. I WAS GOING TO GIVE MYSELF THE OXYGEN BY NOT VETOING AN
AMENDMENT TO THE LAW ON ELECTIONS THAT INCREASES THE POLITICAL DEBT
AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] PER VOTE, PITTING THE PARTIES AGAINST EACH
OTHER--MY PARTY AND THAT OF OUR ADVERSARY. IN OTHER WORDS, I AM NOT
ASKING FOR FAVORS FROM ANYONE OR ANY SUCH THING. I HAVE MY CHIN HELD
HIGH. NOW, IF ANYBODY THROWS A BLOW AT ME I WILL RETURN IT IF I CAN.
I WILL DO SO WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF NOBLENESS AND PROPRIETY, BUT I WILL
RETURN IT. SO, IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF ME ASKING FOR OXYGEN. I AM
QUITE AT EASE, NOT LIKE A MINI-EDITORIAL WRITER SAID THE OTHER
DAY--EDITORIAL WRITERS CAN BE QUITE MEAN, YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]--WHO
SAID THAT I SLEPT LIKE A LOG THE FIRST 2 YEARS. I ALWAYS SLEEP LIKE A
LOG [LAUGHTER] AND DO NOT [WORD INDISTINCT].

   THOSE WHO THOUGHT THEY WOULD MAKE ME LEAVE HERE A PHYSICAL WRECK OR
SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WILL NOT SUCCEED. I THINK HE IS THE ONE WHO
CANNOT SLEEP LIKE A LOG WITH THE DIRTY CONSCIENCE HE MUST HAVE BECAUSE
OF THE DREADFUL THINGS THAT ARE WRITTEN IN THOSE EDITORIALS.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT AID HAS EVEN CUT
THE AID FOR SMALL PROGRAMS, BECAUSE...[CHANGES THOUGHT] AND THAT
HONDURAS HAS TO PAY OVER 2 MILLION [CURRENCY NOT SPECIFIED]...

   [AZCONA] [INTERRUPTING] THAT IS NOT TRUE, NOT TRUE. ALL AID
PROGRAMS ARE ONGOING. A FEW DAYS AGO, THE PRESS ALSO MADE AN IMPROPER
INTERPRETATION WHEN I SAID THAT MILITARY AID WAS BEING CUT.  NO. WHAT
HAPPENS IS THAT, IN THE CASE OF AID, IF THERE IS A DELAY IN PAYMENTS
OF OVER 1 YEAR ON ANY PROGRAM, THE DISBURSEMENTS OF ALL PROGRAMS ARE
STOPPED. THERE WAS A PAYMENT CORRESPONDING TO MILITARY AID, OR
MILITARY COMMITMENTS, THAT HAD NOT BEEN MADE. SO, WE HAD TO
 MAKE IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE DISBURSEMENTS NOT ONLY OF THE MILITARY
SECTOR BUT OF ALL WOULD BE SUSPENDED. IN OTHER WORDS, ALL THAT IS
COVERED, AND, AS I SAY, ALL THAT IS PROCEEDING QUITE WELL.  [CONTINUED]

SALVADORAN ARMY SAID TODAY THAT TWO "ATTACKERS" HAD LOST THEIR LIVES
WHEN THEY CONFRONTED SOLDIERS AFTER HAVING "ROBBED AND RAPED" THE
OWNER OF A BUSINESS IN A CITY OF WESTERN EL SALVADOR.  OPPOSITION
SOURCES, HOWEVER, REJECTED THIS ACCOUNT AND DESCRIBED THE INCIDENT AS
"MURDER."

   JUAN JOSE MARTELL, LEADER OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT
(MPSC, OPPOSITION), REJECTED THE MILITARY VERSION AND ACCUSED THE ARMY
OF "MURDERING" PARTY LEADER CECILIO RIVERA AND TWO OTHER PARTY
SUPPORTERS.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE SAID THAT RIVERA AND APOLINARIO
ALFARO -- THE THIRD PERSON WAS NOT MENTIONED -- LOST THEIR LIVES WHEN
THEY CONFRONTED, ALONG WITH FOUR OTHER MEN, TROOPS OF MILITARY
DETACHMENT NO.  6, IN SONSONATE, 65 KM WEST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE MILITARY REPORT ADDED THAT THE "CRIMINALS" HAD ROBBED A SMALL
SHOP, WHOSE OWNER, MARIA TERESA LOPEZ, HAD BEEN "RAPED" BY THE
ATTACKERS.

   MARTELL SAID THAT THE BODIES OF THE [MPSC] MEMBERS WERE FOUND LAST
NIGHT AT THE SONSONATE CEMETERY ALONG WITH A SIGN THAT READ: "BECAUSE
THEY BETRAYED THE FATHERLAND."

   "WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR RIVERA'S MURDER AND
THE TWO OTHER [MPSC] SUPPORTERS ARE SOLDIERS OF MILITARY DETACHMENT
NO. 6," MARTELL STRESSED.

   THE [MPSC] IS PART OF THE LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE COALITION,
WHICH TOOK PART IN THE 19 MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   IN ANOTHER TURN OF EVENTS, THE ARMY HAS ACCUSED THE GUERRILLAS OF
KIDNAPPING APPROXIMATELY 30 PEASANTS IN CUSCATLAN AND SANTA ANA
DEPARTMENTS, LOCATED TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF SAN SALVADOR,
RESPECTIVELY.

   MEANWHILE, THE REBELS STEPPED-UP THEIR SABOTAGE AGAINST THE

TODAY THAT THE STRIKE BY JUDICIAL BRANCH EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING JUDGES
AND MAGISTRATES, IS ILLEGAL.  THE STRIKE, WHICH BEGAN ON 3 NOVEMBER,
IS TO DEMAND THE ADOPTION OF SECURITY MEASURES.

   GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS SAID TODAY THAT THE STRIKE BY THE
JUDICIAL BRANCH "IS ILLEGAL BECAUSE ITS EMPLOYEES PROVIDE A PUBLIC
SERVICE."  "THE GOVERNMENT," HE ADDED, "HAS TRIED TO HANDLE THIS
SITUATION VERY CAREFULLY, UNDERSTANDING THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS
UPSET BECAUSE OF TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST ITS MEMBERS."

   THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS BEGAN THEIR TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE
COLOMBIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN 1984 WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF JUSTICE
MINISTER RODRIGO LARA BONILLA.  DURING THE 2 MONTHS OF THE "TOTAL WAR"
COLOMBIA HAS BEEN WAGING AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SOME 20 MAGISTRATES
AND JUDGES HAVE BEEN KILLED BY "NARCO-TERRORISTS."

   THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF JUDICIAL BRANCH EMPLOYEES

STRIKE IS "TOTALLY ILLEGAL."  THEREFORE, HE ADDED, "IT WILL BE
NECESSARY TO TAKE DISCIPLINARY MEASURES."  "JUSTICE MUST WORK SO THAT
VIOLENCE DOES NOT SUCCEED IN COLOMBIA," HE SAID.

BY REITERATING U.S.  GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
THE CONTINUATION OF OUR COUNTRY'S MILITARY STRUGGLE IS ENCOURAGED.
HOWEVER, THE GROUP NOTED THAT ARONSON'S PRESENCE ALSO SERVES TO REVEAL

   LIMA, 9 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] WITH JUST THREE DAYS TO GO BEFORE
THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 12 NOVEMBER, TERRORISTS HAVE
STEPPED UP THEIR VIOLENCE AND SECURITY FORCES HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR
ANTISUBVERSIVE OPERATIONS IN SEVERAL PERUVIAN REGIONS.

   SHINING PATH MEMBERS LAST NIGHT BOMBED AN OFFICE OF THE RULING
AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA) PARTY IN LIMA, INJURING
FOUR PEOPLE, ONE OF THEM SERIOUSLY.

   DURING THE ATTACK THE OFFICE WAS SET ON FIRE. AN EYEWITNESS SAID
THAT SOME 150 ELECTORAL CARDS WERE BURNED. THE CARDS, WHICH ARE THE
ONLY VALID DOCUMENT FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE ELECTIONS, HAD BEEN TAKEN
TO THE PARTY OFFICE SO THAT THE VOTING STATION COULD BE DEFINED.

   POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED AT LEAST SIX BOMBINGS LAST NIGHT IN
THE ANDEAN CITY OF AYACUCHO, 575 KM SOUTHEAST OF THE LIMA.  THE
SOURCES, HOWEVER, DID NOT MENTION THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE ATTACKED.

   ON 7 NOVEMBER, SHINING PATH TERRORISTS BLEW UP 4 PYLONS IN THE
VICINITY OF AYACUCHO, RAZING TO 17 THE NUMBER OF PYLONS THAT HAVE BEEN
BLOWN UP BY THIS MAOIST ORGANIZATION IN AYACUCHO AND IN ZONES OF
HUANCAVELICA DEPARTMENT IN THE PAST FEW DAYS.

   A SHINING PATH "ELIMINATION COMMANDO" MURDERED A NATIONAL POLICE
COMMANDER ON 7 NOVEMBER IN THE RESIDENTIAL LIMA DISTRICT OF
MIRAFLORES.  THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED A POWER OUTAGE IN TOWNS OF THE
HUAYLAS VALLEY, IN THE MOUNTAINOUS REGION OF THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
OF ANCASH, FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF TWO PYLONS.

   IN ONE OF THE TOWNS -- RANRAHIRCA -- THE SOURCES SAID THAT THE
SHINING PATH MEMBERS SET THE CITY HALL FACILITY ON FIRE, DESTROYING
VALUABLE DOCUMENTS.  IN LA OROYA, JUNIN DEPARTMENT, IN THE CENTRAL
PERUVIAN MOUNTAIN RANGE, PUBLIC BUILDINGS WERE BOMBED AND A CAR-BOMB
WAS DETONATED.

   REPORTS RECEIVED FROM AYACUCHO AND FROM OTHER RURAL AREAS SAY THAT
TERRORISTS ARE STOPPING VEHICLES IN HIGHWAYS AND THAT THEY ARE
STRIPPING PASSENGERS OF THEIR ELECTORAL CARDS, WHICH THEY THEN
DESTROY.

   IN VIEW OF THIS ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, THE GOVERNMENT ON 7
NOVEMBER DECREED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE 10 PROVINCES OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF LIMA, PLACING THEM UNDER MILITARY CONTROL.  THIS IS THE
PERUVIAN DEPARTMENT WITH THE LARGEST POPULATION AND WITH THE LARGEST
NUMBER OF VOTERS.  IT HAS MORE THAN 6,000,000 PEOPLE, AND INCLUDES THE
PORT OF CALLAO.

   ON 6 NOVEMBER, THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES IMPOSED A CURFEW BETWEEN
1000 AND 0500 IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF JUNIN AND PASCO IN THE CENTRAL
MOUNTAIN RANGE.  THE SAME MEASURE HAS ALREADY BEEN ENFORCED IN
AYACUCHO, APURIMAC, AND HUANCAVELICA.

   THE POLITICAL-MILITARY COMMAND OF THE AYACUCHO EMERGENCY ZONE LAST
NIGHT ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE ENFORCING STRICT MEASURES THAT WILL BE
OBSERVED BY THE PEOPLE DURING THE ELECTIONS.

   THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT AS OF 13 NOVEMBER, THOSE ELECTORAL CARD
THAT DO NOT BEAR THE SEAL THAT IS STAMPED AT THE VOTING STATIONS AND
WHICH PROVES THAT THE BEARER HAS CAST HIS VOTE WILL BE ARRESTED AND
"PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE COURTS."

   IT ADDS THAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO TRAVEL,TO MAKE ADMINISTRATIVE
ARRANGEMENTS, TO OBTAIN DOCUMENTS, OR TO PERFORM COMMERCIAL
TRANSACTIONS, THEY WILL HAVE TO SHOW THEIR ELECTORAL CARD WITH THE
CORRESPONDING SEAL, UNDER PENALTY OF BEING FORBIDDEN TO PROCEED.

   DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY, THE TECHNICAL POLICE PRESENTED
27 ALLEGED SHINING PATH MEMBERS WHO WERE CAPTURED IN SOUTHERN LIMA
PROVINCES AND IN ICA. THEY ARE CHARGED WITH BEING INVOLVED IN AT LEAST
40 ATTACKS AND MURDERS OF AUTHORITIES, AND WITH PLANNING FUTURE
ATTACKS AGAINST ELECTORAL OFFICES AND CANDIDATES IN THE UPCOMING
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.

   COMBINED MILITARY AND POLICE FORCES YESTERDAY RAIDED THE SAN
FERNANDO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE OF THE LIMA UNIVERSITY OF SAN MARCOS,
ARRESTING 600 PERSONS AND SEIZING EXPLOSIVES AND PROPAGANDA MATERIAL.

   BUENOS AIRES, 9 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [EXCERPTS] THE MOTOR
TRANSPORT WORKERS UNION [UTA] BEGAN AN INDEFINITE STRIKE AT MIDNIGHT,
CONTRADICTING GOVERNMENT ORDERS WHICH STATED THAT THE UTA AND THE
ARGENTINE FEDERATION OF AUTOMOTIVE PASSENGER CARRIERS [FATAP] MUST
SOLVE THE SALARY PROBLEM THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS.

   THE SITUATION ON THE THIRD DAY OF THE STOPPAGE IS SLIGHTLY BETTER,
ALTHOUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE STILL WAITING ON THE STREETS
TRYING TO GET ON THE FEW BUSES BEING DRIVEN BY THEIR OWNERS.

   A FEW MINUTES AGO, DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR TRANSPORTATION NESTOR
FERNANDEZ ANNOUNCED THAT AT MIDDAY ONLY 30 PERCENT OF THE USUAL NUMBER
OF BUSES IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL WERE WORKING NORMALLY; BECAUSE OF
THIS, MEASURES WILL BE ADOPTED TO ENSURE THAT AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF
THE BUSES WILL RUN TODAY.

   REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FEDERAL POLICE, THE BUENOS AIRES PROVINCIAL
POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GENDERMERIE ARE MEETING AT TRANSPORTATION
SECRETARIAT OFFICES TO STUDY WAYS OF RESTORING NORMAL BUS SERVICE.

   SUBWAY CHAIRMAN JOSE BARBERO REPORTS THAT HIS SECTOR'S SERVICES
HAVE ALSO IMPROVED, AND FIVE SUBWAY LINES ARE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.
ALTHOUGH THE SUBWAY PERSONNEL ARE MEMBERS OF THE UTA, THEY HAVE
DECIDED TO SUSPEND THEIR STRIKE.

   THE RAILROAD SERVICE IS NORMAL.  MORE COACHES WILL BE PUT INTO
SERVICE, AND THE NUMBER OF TRAINS IN SERVICE WILL BE INCREASED, BUT
TRAINS OF THE ROCA LINE CONNECTING CONSTITUCION TO LA PLATA THROUGH
THE TEMPERLEY STRETCH ARE DELAYED BECAUSE OF A DERAILMENT.

   UTA SECRETARY GENERAL JUAN MANUEL PALACIOS HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE
INDEFINITE STRIKE WILL CONTINUE AND THAT THE UTA WILL NOT ACCEPT
COMPULSORY NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A LEGAL SOLUTION TO THE
CONFLICT.  HE SAYS THAT THIS WOULD MERELY PUT OFF THE PROBLEM FOR A
MONTH OR SO.  PALACIOS ADDED THAT IT WOULD ONLY CREATE MORE
DIFFICULTIES FOR THE WORKERS.

   FATAP DIRECTOR LUIS CARRAL ASSERTED THAT THE BUSINESS SECTOR WILL
DOUBLE ITS EFFORTS TO PUT THE BUSES BACK INTO SERVICE.  CARRAL SAID
THAT IN VIEW OF COMPULSORY NEGOTIATIONS FATAP WILL URGE WORKERS TO
RETURN TO THEIR JOBS UNLESS THEY WANT TO BE DISMISSED.

   TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BUSINESSMEN HAVE INFORMED THE TRANSPORTATION
SECRETARIAT THAT A FEW DRIVERS ARE RETURNING TO WORK.  BUSINESSMEN
BELIEVE THAT IN A FEW MORE HOURS 40-50 PERCENT OF THE BUSES WILL BE
FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.

   PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM COMMENTED THIS MORNING ON THE UTA ATTITUDE:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MENEM] THIS IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  WE CANNOT
PAY MORE THAN WE HAVE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE BUSINESSMEN HAVE OFFERED A
BASIC SALARY OF AROUND 75,000 AUSTRALES PER MONTH.  UNTIL YESTERDAY
THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTED NEARLY $100, AND THIS IS A GOOD INCREASE.

   EVIDENTLY, THERE IS A POLITICAL INFILTRATION OF IDEAS THAT ARE NOT
SHARED BY ALL ARGENTINE PEOPLE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE INFILTRATION
COMES FROM PERONIST OR RADICAL MOVEMENTS.  THIS IS THE
 WORK OF THE ULTRA-LEFT.  [END RECORDING]

   MENEM ASSERTED THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK AND WHO ARE SACRIFICING
THEMSELVES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE WILL BE REWARDED.  HE URGED
THEM NOT TO LEAVE THEIR POSTS.  MENEM ADDED THAT YESTERDAY MANY
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ASKED HIM NOT TO GIVE IN.  THE PRESIDENT SAID HE
HAS DECIDED NOT GIVE IN, NOT BECAUSE HE IS STUBBORN, BUT BECAUSE
PEOPLE WHO NEED THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SERVICES CANNOT BE DEFRAUDED.

   ASKED IF THE RAILROADS THAT JOIN THE STRIKE WILL BE CLOSED DOWN,
MENEM SAID:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MENEM] THE RAILROAD LINES THAT STRIKE WILL BE
CLOSED.

   [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] BUT MANY PEOPLE WILL BE LEFT WITHOUT
TRANSPORTATION.

   [MENEM] WE WILL FIND A WAY OF GETTING THESE PEOPLE TO THEIR JOBS.
WE CANNOT ACCEPT THIS TYPE OF ATTITUDE.  OR WOULD YOU PREFER TO SEE
THE COUNTRY EXPLODE?  [END RECORDING]

   AT 1700 THIS AFTERNOON THE CABINET MEETING THAT STARTED LAST NIGHT
WILL BE RECONVENED.  THE CABINET MEMBERS ATTENDING THE MEETING WILL
ANALYZE THE DIFFICULTIES CREATED BY THE UTA DECISION TO CONTINUE THE
STRIKE.  THE MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] ROOM UNDER
THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF INTERIOR MINISTER EDUARDO BAUZA.  JUSTICIALIST
LEADER ANTONIO CAFFIERO WILL ATTEND THE MEETING.  PRES MENEM WILL NOT
ATTEND.

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT 50 BUS COMPANIES HAVE BEEN URGED TO
RETURN TO NORMAL WORK; OTHERWISE DECREE 429, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE
TEMPORARY CONFISCATION OF BUSES, WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.  THIS DECREE,
WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY PRESIDENT MENEM, ESTABLISHES THAT BUSES
WILL BE CONFISCATED AND DRIVEN BY NATIONAL GENDARMERIE PERSONNEL.

   IN A JUSTICIALIST PARTY COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ANTONIO CAFFIERO, THE
PARTY EXPRESSES ITS SUPPORT FOR THE DECISIONS MADE BY PRESIDENT MENEM.

   COMMANDER ADALINO BARBERI, THE NATIONAL GENDARMERIE DIRECTOR
GENERAL, HAS REPORTED THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARIAT OFFICIALS
ARE STILL STUDYING THE MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO CONFISCATE THE BUSES
FROM THE OWNERS WHO FAIL TO FOLLOW GOVERNMENT INSTRUCTIONS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 NOV 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT
OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI YESTERDAY REAFFIRMED ITS WILLINGNESS TO
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN
WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION].  IT ALSO MADE AN APPEAL SO THAT NO
ACCUSATIONS LACKING SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT ARE MADE IN ORDER NOT TO
GENERATE SPECULATIONS THAT POLITICIZE THIS CASE.

   IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, THE GOVERNMENT MADE THE PRECEDING
STATEMENT BECAUSE OF THE "BIASED PROPAGANDISTIC CAMPAIGN BEING
DEVELOPED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] AND
OTHER POLITICAL AND LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS, SEEKING TO CREATE A
DISTORTED VIEW OF THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE COUNTRY."

   THE COMMUNIQUE RECALLS THAT ON THE SAME DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK
AGAINST FENASTRAS, THE GOVERNMENT CONDEMNED SUCH CRIMINAL ACTION.  THE
COMMUNIQUE ALSO EXPRESSES THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO CONDUCT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WITHIN A FRAMEWORK WORTHY OF CONFIDENCE.  THE
GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO CREATE A COMMISSION THAT WILL BE COMPOSED OF
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, CEDES [SALVADORAN
EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE], POLITICAL PARTIES, LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS --
INCLUDING ONE FROM FENASTRAS -- DR IGNACIO ELLACURIA, THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER.

   HOWEVER, FENASTRAS LEADERS HAVE CONTINUED HINDERING THE
INVESTIGATION AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS.

   THE GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE FENASTRAS REFUSAL TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMISSION COULD BE INTERPRETED AS "AN INTENTIONAL
PLAN BY FENASTRAS LEADERS TO PREVENT THE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TERRORIST ATTACK."  THEREFORE, THE
GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE REQUESTS THE ABANDONMENT OF SUCH AN ATTITUDE.

   THE GOVERNMENT, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS, BELIEVES THAT THE
INVESTIGATION IS LEGAL AND THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE MORAL DUTY TO HELP
IN THE INVESTIGATION TO CLARIFY THIS CASE.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI REITERATED ITS APPEAL TO
CITIZENS TO ABSTAIN FROM MAKING ACCUSATIONS LACKING SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE, IN ORDER TO PREVENT SPECULATION THAT HAMPERS THE NORMAL
DEVELOPMENT OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS THAT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.  THE
GOVERNMENT REITERATED THAT "ITS TRUE OBJECTIVE IS TO CLARIFY THIS
BARBARIC ACTION AND TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE, NO MATTER WHO THEY
ARE."

   "WE REQUEST ALL CITIZENS TO ABSTAIN FROM ISSUING SPECULATIVE
OPINIONS, AND, SHOULD THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT THAT WOULD HELP
CLARIFY THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT, THEY SHOULD DO IT WITHIN THE
JUDICIAL PROCESS," THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE STATES.

   THE GOVERNMENT REAFFIRMED ITS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE SEARCHING
FOR PEACE THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS AND DIALOGUE.  ACCORDING TO THE
MEXICO AGREEMENTS, THE FLMN IS ALSO OBLIGED TO CONTINUE WITH THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS AND "CANNOT UNILATERALLY WITHDRAW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
VIOLATING NOT ONLY THOSE AGREEMENTS, BUT ALSO THE ASPIRATION OF OUR
PEOPLE, WHICH IS TO ATTAIN PEACE," THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS.

FORMER SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY [PCCH], HAS
REQUESTED A NUREMBERG-STYLE TRIAL FOR MEMBERS OF THE CURRENT
ADMINISTRATION IF PATRICIO AYLWIN WINS THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS.

   CORVALAN'S STATEMENTS WERE PUBLISHED IN THE LATEST ISSUE OF COSAS

FRONT [FPMR] AND THE COMMUNISTS' RIGHT TO HAVE MILITARY TRAINING.

   THE FORMER PCCH SECRETARY GENERAL SAID THAT HIS PARTY IS WORKING

IF AYLWIN WINS THE ELECTIONS, THE PCCH IS READY TO PARALYZE THE

   THE PCCH LEADER POINTED OUT THE NEED TO MODIFY THE CHILEAN JUDICIAL
BRANCH SUBSTANTIALLY. HE REQUESTED SPECIAL COURTS, LIKE THE ONES THAT
EXISTED IN NUREMBERG, TO TRY THE MEMBERS OF THE CURRENT
ADMINISTRATION.

   CORVALAN REQUESTED THE FREEDOM OF THE SO-CALLED POLITICAL
PRISONERS, INCLUDING FPMR AND LAUTARO MOVEMENT TERRORISTS. HE SAID HE
DOES NOT CARE WHETHER LEFTIST SYMPATHIZERS ARE INVOLVED IN ANY CRIME,
INCLUDING IN THE MURDER OF CARABINEROS.

EVERYTHING BECAME VERY CLEAR.  ALL THE PAST ACTIONS ARE PART OF THE
GOVERNMENT'S AND THE ARMY'S WAR ACTIONS AGAINST ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS
AND DEMONSTRATIONS BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION]
MASSACRE WAS PART OF THIS PLAN.  THE KILLING OF 3 MEMBERS OF THE MPSC
[SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT] IN SONSONATE CARRIED OUT BY THE
6TH MILITARY DETACHMENT IN FRONT OF WITNESSES -- THEY LEFT MESSAGES ON
THE BODIES STATING THAT THEY WERE TRAITORS TO THE HOMELAND -- WAS
CARRIED OUT WITH THE CLEAR INTENTION OF SENDING ANOTHER MESSAGE.  THE
MESSAGE IS: NOT ONLY IN THEORY DO WE CONSIDER YOU COMPONENTS OF THE
ENEMY SIDE.  YOU ARE THE ENEMY AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE KILLING YOU.
[END RECORDING]

   REGARDING THE VISIT TO EL SALVADOR OF BERNARD ARONSON, ASSISTANT
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, COMMANDER JORGE SHAFIK
HANDAL SAID:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HANDAL] THE HEADS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND
MILITARY UNITS WHO CARRIED OUT THESE CRIMES REMAIN IN OFFICE.  THOSE
WHO GAVE THE ORDERS REMAIN IN OFFICE.  THEN HOW CAN AN INVESTIGATION
BE CARRIED OUT?  A CHAIN OF COMMAND MUST BE FOLLOWED IN THE MILITARY.
IF A SUBORDINATE IS GOING TO BE INTERROGATED, ONE MUST FIRST ASK
PERMISSION FROM HIS SUPERIOR, AND THEY ARE THE SUPERIORS.  BESIDES, NO
ONE KNOWS WHO THE SUBORDINATES WHO PARTICIPATED ARE.  THAT INFORMATION
MUST COME FROM THE ARMY.  THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SAID THAT THE LEAST THEY
CAN DO BEFORE THEY BEGIN INVESTIGATING THIS INCIDENT IS REMOVE COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE.  THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.  I WOULD EVEN
ADD THAT THERE ARE A FEW OTHERS WHO SHOULD BE REMOVED.

   IF WE WERE LIVING IN A COUNTRY WITH A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM
AND WITH LABOR UNIONS, THAT WOULD BE COMMON PRACTICE.  IT WOULD NOT
EVEN BE NECESSARY TO BRING THIS UP AT A PUBLIC DEBATE.  THE FIRST
THING THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE DONE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE
ARMED FORCES -- HE IS INVOLVED IN THESE CRIMES BECAUSE HE IS COMMANDER
IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES -- IS REMOVE THEM AND NOT SAY THAT HE WAS
NOT CONSULTED ON THIS MATTER.  HE CLAIMS HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS,
BUT WE HAVE OUR OWN SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND WE KNOW THAT HE KNEW.
BUT IF HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE DID NOT KNOW,
THEN THE FIRST THING HE SHOULD DO IS WHAT ANY MAN WITH ANY
SELF-RESPECT WOULD DO: ASK FOR AN INVESTIGATION.  HOWEVER, HE IS
HINDERING THE INVESTIGATION, WHICH IS WHAT IS ALWAYS DONE WHEN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS.  WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN, A FEW --
THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE MATTERS CLARIFIED -- RESIGN, WHILE OTHERS ARE
REMOVED. [CONTINUED]

SOME LINKS BETWEEN THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION

DR MANUEL PACAS CASTRO SAID IN SANTIAGO DE CHILE.  DURING HIS OFFICIAL
VISIT TO CHILE, THE SALVADORAN MINISTER MET WITH PRESIDENT AUGUSTO
PINOCHET AND OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

   PACAS CASTRO AND HIS CHILEAN COUNTERPART HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ
SIGNED A JOINT DECLARATION EXPRESSING "THEIR CONCERN OVER TERRORIST
ACTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE FOREIGN SUPPORT TO SUBVERSIVE
GROUPS."

   THE TWO MINISTERS STATED THAT THE "GUERRILLA" ACTIONS HINDER
DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND BASICALLY AFFECT THE MOST
NEEDY SECTORS."

   IN THE DOCUMENT, CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER ERRAZURIZ EXPRESSES "THE
SUPPORT OF THE CHILEAN GOVERMENT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS PROMOTED BY
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND FOR THE PEACE EFFORTS IN CENTRAL
AMERICA."

   FOLLOWING THE SIGNING OF THE DECLARATION, FOREIGN MINISTER PACAS
TOLD NEWSMEN THAT "GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS IN LATIN AMERICA ARE OF
CASTRO-COMMUNIST INSPIRATION."  HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE PRESIDENTS OF
CUBA AND NICARAGUA.

   "THE MAIN INSTIGATOR IS FIDEL CASTRO," HE ADDED.  "ALL THOSE GROUPS
HAVE A COMMON DENOMINATOR AND ADOPT THEIR OWN METHODS IN EACH
COUNTRY."

   PACAS DID NOT RULE OUT THERE MAY BE SOME LINKS BETWEEN THE FMLN AND
CHILEAN GUERRILLAS.  "I AM NOT AWARE OF A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP," HE
CLARIFIED.  "HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT RULED OUT THAT POSSIBILITY BECAUSE
CITIZENS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ARRIVED IN EL SALVADOR TO FIGHT."

   IN CONCLUSION, HE ADDED: "WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS HAVE HAD THEIR TRAINING CENTERS IN NICARAGUA."

POLICE HAVE ARRESTED COLOMBIAN CITIZEN JORGE HUMBERTO CHALARIA, KNOWN
AS "EL NEGRO," THE REPRESENTATIVE IN MEXICO OF COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKER GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS "EL MEXICANO,"
THE TOP CHIEF OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
(PGR) MADE KNOWN TODAY.

   CHALARIA, 30 YEARS OLD, 5 OTHER COLOMBIANS, 1 VENEZUELAN, AND 12
MEXICANS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED "IN THE LAST 2 DAYS" AND 550 KG OF PURE
COCAINE HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED IN OPERATIONS CONDUCTED IN THIS CITY AND
IN THE STATES OF SONORA AND TAMAULIPAS, A PGR SPOKESMAN SAID.

   THE GANG OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS LED BY CHALARIA WERE ABLE TO DELIVER
OVER 50 TONS OF PURE COCAINE TO THE STATES OF CALIFORNIA AND FLORIDA
IN THE LAST 4 YEARS, THE PGR SPOKESMAN ADDED.

   "EL NEGRO" CONFESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN IN MEXICO SINCE 1988 UNDER
THE ORDERS OF GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCE.

   THE INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING GANG HAD THE PROTECTION OF
ARTURO CUELLAR TIJERINA, COMMANDER OF THE TAMAULIPAS JUDICIAL POLICE,
WHO WAS ALSO ARRESTED.

   CUELLAR AND A GROUP OF POLICEMEN UNDER HIS ORDERS SUPPLIED FUEL TO
THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WHO BROUGHT THE DRUG INTO MEXICO BY MEANS OF
LIGHT AIRCRAFT, WHICH LANDED ON CLANDESTINE RUNWAYS NEAR THE BORDER
WITH THE UNITED STATES.

   THOSE ARRESTED CONFESSED THAT AMERICAN JULIO CHAGY DE LA ROSA, A
MIAMI RESIDENT, DISTRIBUTED THE DRUG AND "LAUNDERED" THE MONEY
OBTAINED IN THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BUSINESS THROUGH A COMPANY CALLED
"ITAL BAGNO," WHICH SUPPOSEDLY MANUFACTURED STOVES.

   THEY SAID THAT ON 29 OCTOBER THEY RECEIVED A LOAD OF 550 KG OF PURE
COCAINE FROM COLOMBIA, BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY FROM A RANCH LOCATED
IN SONORA. THE NARCOTICS POLICE DETECTED THE ILLEGAL OPERATION AT THE
RANCH AND ARRESTED ALFONSO CASTILLO ARMENTA AND HIS DAUGHTER, WHO HAD
MODERN RADIO COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE
COLOMBIAN PLANES AND WITH "EL NEGRO."

   THE INVESTIGATIONS LED THE POLICE TO A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN
THIS CAPITAL, WHERE "EL NEGRO" HAD RENTED A HOME IN WHICH HE LIVED
WITH A VENEZUELAN WOMAN BY THE NAME OF CRIATINA ROSAS RODRIGUEZ, WHO
COVERED UP THE ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY HER COMPANION.

   THE ARREST IS THE THIRD HEAVY BLOW DEALT ON THE INTERNATIONAL DRUG
TRAFFICKING BUSINESS BY THE MEXICAN POLICE IN THE LAST 3 WEEKS.

   ON 19 OCTOBER, THE POLICE ARRESTED COLOMBIANS RODRIGO DIZUNZA
OCHOA, NEPHEW OF DRUG TRAFFICKER FABIO OCHOA, AND ALFREDO AGUILAR
CASTRO, NEPHEW OF COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER RODRIGUEZ GACHA, WHO HAD
10 KG OF PURE COCAINE IN THEIR POSSESSION.

   EARLY THIS MONTH, MEXICAN RAFAEL MUNOZ TALAVERA WAS ARRESTED.  HE
ALLEGEDLY OWNS THE 20 TONS OF PURE COCAINE DISCOVERED IN A WAREHOUSE
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, IN SEPTEMBER.

   SINCE PRESIDENT CARLOS SALINAS DE GORTARI TOOK OFFICE LAST
DECEMBER, THE MEXICAN NARCOTICS POLICE HAVE CONFISCATED 23 TONS OF
PURE COCAINE AND HAVE ARRESTED NEARLY 10,000 DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

FRONT 1827 [EJERCITO DE RESISTENCIA PATRIOTICA 1827], (ERP-27), A
HERETOFORE UNKNOWN LEFTIST GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION, ANNOUNCED ITS
PRESENCE TODAY IN HONDURAS WITH A PROPAGANDA ACTION.

   TWO DEVICES DESIGNED TO DISTRIBUTE PROPAGANDA EXPLODED IN THIS
CAPITAL, ISSUING THE FIRST ERP-27 PUBLIC COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THE
ORGANIZATION DEMANDS THAT THE NICARAGUAN "CONTRAS" AND "THE U.S.
TROOPS" LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

   THE ERP-27 CLAIMED "THE HONDURAN PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO FIGHT WITH
WEAPONS AND EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS UNTIL THE U.S. MILITARY OCCUPATION
AND ALL FORMS OF FOREIGN SUBJUGATION END."

   THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION'S COMMUNIQUE ALSO DEMANDS RESPECT FOR
THE PRESIDENTIAL AGREEMENTS WHICH SEEK TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN CENTRAL
AMERICA AND "THE END OF THE CRIMINAL WAR AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE."

   THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE ERP-27 IN HONDURAS BUT ITS
PUBLIC APPEARANCE COINCIDES WITH A NEW ANNIVERSARY OF THE LA TRINIDAD
BATTLE, WHICH OCCURRED ON 11 NOVEMBER 1827, THE FIRST MILITARY VICTORY
OF NATIONAL HERO FRANCISCO MORAZAN. MORAZAN, A HONDURAN BY BIRTH, IS
THE MOST IMPORTANT HISTORICAL FIGURE AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN LEVEL.
HE FOUGHT AGAINST CONSERVATIVE SECTORS TO CREATE A SINGLE REPUBLIC
UNDER LIBERAL IDEAS, AND HE WAS EXECUTED BY HIS ADVERSARIES IN 1842 IN
SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.

   MORAZAN IS EXTOLLED BY THE POPULAR AND POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN THE
COUNTRY, AND THERE IS EVEN ONE GUERRRILLA ORGANIZATION CALLED THE
"MORAZANISTA FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF HONDURAS.

   THE ERP-27 IS THE SIXTH LEFTIST ORGANIZATION WHICH HAS DECLARED

THIS OCCASION TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION WHICH HAS ARISEN, A
REPREHENSIBLE SITUATION CAUSED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] WHICH ONCE AGAIN IS ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION IN EL SALVADOR.

   WE BELIEVE IT IS UNJUSTIFIABLE, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR THE
FMLN TO CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF ACTION, WHICH IS NOT A MILITARY ACTION,
KNOWING THAT A PEACE PROCESS IS UNDERWAY.  THESE ARE ACTIONS THAT
GO....[CHANGES THOUGHT] THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THE ONES WHO
PAY MOST DEARLY FOR THE F M L N'S IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE.  THIS IS PROVED
BY THE DEPLORABLE INCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY MORNING, WHEN TWO
SMALL CHILDREN -- 4- YEARS OLD AND 1- YEAR OLD -- DIED AS A RESULT OF
THE F M L N'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS.

   WE BELIEVE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THAT THE PEACE PROCESS IS
IRREVERSIBLE AND IT SHOULD OCCUR; AND IT HAS BEEN SUPPORTED -- NOT
ONLY BY YOU, AS PEOPLE WHO DEMAND PEACE AND TRANQUILITY, BUT ALSO BY
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- THROUGHOUT THESE MONTHS.  YOU HAVE BEEN
THE BEST WITNESSES OF THE EFFORTS EXERTED BY YOUR GOVERNMENT AT THE
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AND OF THE SUPPORT....[CORRECTS HIMSELF] THE
UNDENIABLE SUPPORT RECEIVED FROM ALL THE NATIONS WHO ARE FRIENDS OF EL
SALVADOR.  ACTIONS LIKE THE ONES WHICH THE FMLN IS TRYING TO CARRY OUT
ARE NO LONGER JUSTIFIABLE.

   WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU THIS MORNING FOR THE WAY IN WHICH YOU,
WHO ARE PART OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE [AS HEARD], HAVE BEHAVED.  WE
CANNOT BUT STATE OUR GRATITUDE FOR THE MANY STATEMENTS WE HAVE BEEN
HEARING THROUGH THE NATIONAL NETWORK WHICH BEGAN LAST NIGHT,
PARTICULARLY THE SUPPORT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO YOUR ARMED FORCES.

   THE ARMED FORCES ARE BENT ON STOPPING THE TERRORISTS AND
PROTECTING YOU, MEANING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THE ARMED
 FORCES ARE A PROFESSIONAL CORPS; AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE
PREPARED TO COUNTER ANY IRRATIONAL   FMLN ACTION -- EVEN THIS
ONE, WHICH IS ONLY BEING CARRIED OUT FOR PUBLICITY PURPOSES
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS
ISSUING FALSE STATEMENTS THROUGH A NETWORK THAT HAS BEEN
ESTABLISHED BETWEEN RADIO SANDINO AND RADIO VENCEREMOS.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, OUR ARMED FORCES CONTROL THE SITUATION.  THE
ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS THANKS TO YOUR SUPPORT AND
COOPERATION; AND THE TERRORISTS WILL BE FORCED TO GATHER IN
INCREASINGLY SMALLER PLACES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL
DEFINITELY CONTROL THE SITUATION IN A SHORT TIME.  HOWEVER, IT IS
NECESSARY TO CONTINUE RECEIVING YOUR SUPPORT.  THE ARMED FORCES DO NOT
WANT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TO ENDANGER THE LIFE OF EVEN ONE SINGLE
CIVILIAN; BUT THEY WILL SEE TO IT THAT THE TERRORISTS RECEIVE WHAT
THEY DESERVE ON THIS OCCASION, WHEN THEY HAVE CAUSED SO MUCH DAMAGE TO
THE POPULATION, ITSELF.

   WE BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY FOR YOU TO HEED THE CALL NOT TO GO OUT
ON TO THE STREETS; TO STAY AT HOME OR AT THE RESIDENCE IN WHICH YOU
ARE RIGHT NOW -- EVEN IF IT IS NOT YOUR OWN -- BECAUSE IT IS NOW A
MATTER OF TIME.  I REPEAT, WE DO NOT WANT ANY MORE CASUALTIES AS A
RESULT OF THE F M L N'S IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE. [CONTINUED]

ARMED FORCES WITHIN OUR COUNTRY'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK.  I BELIEVE THAT

FIGHT THEIR IRRATIONAL ACTIONS.  WE ARE STUDYING WHETHER IT WILL BE
NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT A STATE OF SIEGE AND A CURFEW. LATER WE WILL
ADVISE YOU OF THE DECISION THAT THE MINISTERS MAY REACH SO THAT YOU
WILL BE INFORMED.  I BELIEVE THAT IF A STATE OF SIEGE AND A CURFEW ARE
DISCUSSED, IT IS PRECISELY TO PROTECT YOU, TO PROTECT THE CIVILIANS
FROM THE IRRATIONAL FMLN TERRORISTS.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON FOR
THIS.  THESE MEASURES ARE THE TOOLS THAT OUR STATE OF LAW OFFERS FOR
THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES TO PROTECT YOUR LIVES SO THAT WE WILL
NO LONGER HAVE TO REGRET INCIDENTS SUCH AS THE ONES WE HAVE SEEN THE
PAST 2 DAYS.

   WE BELIEVE THAT YOUR ATTITUDE DESERVES OUR RECOGNITION AND THE
RECOGNITION OF ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD. EVERYONE HAS SEEN THAT
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE LOVE DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM AND DO NOT WANT MORE
VIOLENCE, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO THEY SUPPORT THESE IRRATIONAL
ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE ARMED FORCES AND THE PEOPLE WILL AGAIN WIN.
THEY WILL TRIUMPH OVER THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  WE ASK YOU TO CONTINUE
SUPPORTING US, THAT YOU CONTINUE TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACT
EFFECTIVELY , WITHOUT ENDANGERING MORE CIVILIAN LIVES.  THROUGHOUT THE
DAY WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT ON THE SITUATION, AND WE REPEAT, THE
ARMED FORCES WILL CONTROL THE SITUATION SHORTLY.

   THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND YOUR EFFECTIVE COOPERATION.

THE BOMBING OF SALVADORAN CITIES.  WHEN THOSE AIRPLANES BOMB CITIES
THEY ARE REALLY BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  HOW CAN THEY KNOW
WHO THE BOMBS, ROCKETS, OR SHOTS WILL HIT?  IT IS A TRULY DANGEROUS

   I URGE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- JUST AS IT BECOMES
CONCERNED, CARRIES OUT CAMPAIGNS, AND MAKES STATEMENTS WHEN THE
NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT ADOPTS HARSH MEASURES -- WHEN THESE EVENTS ARE
TAKING PLACE IN EL SALVADOR TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE SITUATION.  THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST SPEAK OUT AND PREVENT THE BOMBING OF

PERFECTLY WELL THAT THE BATTLE WE ARE WAGING IN THE ELECTORAL FIELD IS
THE SAME BATTLE WE HAVE WAGED IN THE MILITARY FIELD WITH THE CONTRAS,
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THIS BATTLE IS IN THE ELECTORAL FIELD.
THE ELECTIONS WILL BE BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND THE UNITED STATES, BETWEEN
NICARAGUA'S INDEPENDENCE AND THE UNITED STATES, WHICH DOES NOT WANT
NICARAGUA TO BE INDEPENDENT.

   WHO, THEN, WILL WE VOTE FOR ON 25 NOVEMBER?  [CROWD RESPONSE
UNMONITORABLE] WE MUST VOTE FOR NICARAGUA, AND WE MUST INVITE ALL
NICARAGUANS TO VOTE FOR NICARAGUA, EVEN IF THOSE NICARAGUANS ARE NOT
MEMBERS OF THE FSLN [SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT -], EVEN IF
THOSE NICARAGUANS WERE MEMBERS OF OTHER PARTIES, EVEN IF THOSE
NICARAGUANS WERE INVOLVED WITH SOMOZISM IN THE PAST.  IT IS A MATTER
OF VOTING FOR NICARAGUA, AGAINST THE IMPERIALIST POLICY; IT IS A
MATTER OF CHOOSING BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND THE IMPERIALIST POWER; AND
NICARAGUA IS REPRESENTED BY THE FSLN.  NO ONE MUST BE MISTAKEN ABOUT
THIS.  [APPLAUSE].

   THE FSLN IS THE ONLY FORCE THAT CAN GUARANTEE STABILITY FOR ALL THE
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SECTORS OF THIS COUNTRY: LARGE- SMALL- AND
MEDIUM-SCALE PRODUCERS, MERCHANTS, INDUSTRIALISTS, EVERYONE.  ONLY THE

SIMPLY A MESS OF PEOPLE, A BADLY MADE AND WRAPPED TAMALE.  THAT IS
WHAT UNO IS, AND NO ONE CAN EAT IT.  [APPLAUSE, SHOUTS]

   YOU LIKE BASEBALL, RIGHT?  YOU LIKE BASEBALL.  WHEN THE BATTER IS
UP, THE PITCHER THROWS AND THE BATTER HITS THE BALL, BUT THE BALL
VEERS LEFT, WHAT IS THAT?  [CROWD RESPONDS: FOUL TO THE LEFT].  IF HE
BATS AGAIN AND THE BALL GOES THE OTHER WAY, WHAT IS THAT?  [CROWD
RESPONDS: FOUL TO THE RIGHT].  AND HE HITS IT THROUGH THE CENTER, WAY
UP THERE ....  [CROWD RESPONDS: HOME RUN] IT IS A HOMERUN.  THEREFORE,
ONE SHOULD BAT NEITHER TO THE LEFT NOR TO THE RIGHT BUT THROUGH THE
CENTER; 25 IN THE FIFTH [AS HEARD].  YOU MUST HIT A HOME RUN, 25 IN

CONTROL OF THE MUNICIPAL MAYORS' OFFICES IN SEVERAL PLACES THROUGHTOUT
THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY.  ALSO, IN SAN SALVADOR WE
HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL PRISONERS OF WAR.  THEY ARE PART OF THE REPRESSIVE
FORCES OF THE NATIONAL POLICE AND THE BELLOSO BATTALION.  WE HAVE ALSO
CONFISCATED A LARGE SUPPLY OF WAR MATERIEL FROM THE FASCISTS ENEMY
FORCES.  THESE WEAPONS ARE NOW IN THE HANDS OF OUR PEOPLE AND ARE NOW
GOING TO BE USED TO SHOOT THE FASCISTS.  THESE WEAPONS ARE IN THE
HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO USE THEM TO ATTAIN JUSTICE FOR THE
MURDERS OF FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, OTHER COOPERATIVISTS, THE TEN
UNION LEADERS, AND MSGR ARNULFO ROMERO.  THESE WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF
THE PEOPLE ARE A GUARANTEE FOR JUSTICE, DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

   ATTENTION, ATTENTION, THIS IS LAST MINUTE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN
RECEIVED BY RADIO VENCEREMOS.  ATTENTION SALVADORANS AND PRESS
AGENCIES THAT ARE MONITORING OUR GUERRILLA RADIO STATION.  WE HAVE
RECEIVED REPORTS THAT BOMBINGS CONTINUE IN SAN SALVADOR.
INDISCRMINATE BOMBING CONTINUES IN SAN SALVADOR.  WE HAVE RECEIVED
REPORTS OF INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING IN ZACAMIL, SOYAPANGO, AND SAN
MARCOS NEIGHBORHOODS.  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THESE AREAS.  THESE
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE DENSELY POPULATED.  WE ALSO RECEIVED THE REPORT THAT
A DEATH SQUAD HEADED BY COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES HAS AGAIN
TAKEN ACTIONS AGAINST A CIVILIAN POPULATION JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE
UNABLE TO COMBAT OUR PERSONNEL.  THIS SQUAD ENTERED THE SALVADORAN
UNIVERSITY FROM THE AREA WHERE THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS LOCATED.
WE MUST NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS NEAR THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE
HEADQUARTERS.  THEY CAPTURED 13 CIVILIANS, BLINDFOLDED, TIED, AND TOOK
THEM INTO THAT MILITARY HEADQUARTERS.  ELENA FUENTES -- THAT
REPUDIABLE MURDERER, THAT ASSASSIN GORRILLA -- COWARDLY ATTACKS THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION AS HE IS UNABLE TO COMBAT THE PEOPLE'S ARMED
PERSONNEL.  FUENTES IS UNABLE TO STRIKE BACK SO HE ATTACKS MOTHERS AND
UNION MEMBERS.  THIS IS WHAT THIS TWO-BIT COLONEL IS ACCUSTOMED TO
DOING.  HE STRIKES OUT AT THE PEOPLE.  LET HIM COME OUT AND FIGHT THE
REBELS IN SAN SALVADOR.  OUR PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF DEATH
SQUADS, POVERTY, REPRESSION, AND FASCIST TOTALITARIANISM.  WE ARE
TOTALLY DECIDED AND FIRMLY DETERMINED TO OVERCOME THE FASCIST
LATANDONA OFFICERS [NAME GIVEN TO 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN GERARDO
BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].  SALVADORAN PEOPLE: AS ONE STRONG FIST, LET
US ALL JOIN TOGETHER AND STRIKE THE FASCISTS.  LET'S TAKE IT TO THE
HILT.

VENCEREMOS NOW ANNOUNCES TO OUR PEOPLE, AS WELL AS TO THE NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL PRESS, WAR REPORT NO.  1 ON OUR NATIONAL MILITARY
MANUEVER.

   AT 2000 ON 11 NOVEMBER [0200 GMT ON 12 NOVEMBER], THE
 FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL FRONT] LAUNCHED THE MILITARY -
POLITICAL PLAN DRAFTED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND CONSISTING OF A NATIONAL
MILITARY MANEUVER CALLED: "OUT WITH THE FASCISTS!  FEBE ELIZABETH
LIVES!"  THE PLAN BEGAN WITH AN ATTACK FROM AT LEAST 50 DIRECTIONS ON
THE ENEMY POSITIONS IN THE CITY OF SAN SALVADOR.  SINCE THAT TIME, OUR
UNITS HAVE BEEN WAGING FIERCE COMBAT WITH THE ENEMY FORCES, OCCUPYING
POSITIONS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CITY THAT WE ARE STILL HOLDING.

   OTHER GROUPS LATER JOINED THE MANEUVER AND ATTACKED IN THE CITIES
OF SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, SANTA ANA, CHALATENANGO, AND
THE COMALAPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.  THERE WERE ALSO DOZENS OF ATTACKS
AGAINST POSITIONS IN TOWNS AND HIGHWAYS OF THE COUNTRY.

   AFTER 18 HOURS OF COMBAT, THE FOLLOWING ARE THE ESTIMATED RESULTS:
OVER 400 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMED FORCES, INCLUDING KILLED AND WOUNDED;
12 ARMORED VEHICLES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED; 3 HELICOPTERS AND 1 OR 2
SMALL SMALL AIRPLANES WERE DESTROYED ON THE GROUND; AND 2 HELICOPTERS
WERE DOWNED; TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CARTRIDGES, OVER 50 RIFLES,
MACHINEGUNS, AND OTHER TYPES OF WEAPONS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.

   THESE RESULTS GREATLY EXCEED THE EXPECTATIONS OF THIS MANEUVER DUE
TO THE IMPACT AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIGHTING.  OUR FIGHTERS HAVE
FULFILLED THIS PART OF THE PLAN IN A DARING, COURAGEOUS, AND EFFECTIVE
MANNER, PROVING THEIR HIGH COMBAT MORALE.  NOW THEY MUST HOLD THE
POSITIONS THEY HAVE TAKEN, THUS GUARANTEEING THAT THE GOALS OF THE
PLAN ARE ACHIEVED.

   WE DENOUNCE THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING BY THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE.
WE CALL ON THE PEOPLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE BOMBING.  TO DO
THIS, THE PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FROM OUR
FIGHTERS.  WE ALSO CALL ON THE COUNTRY'S CIVILIAN POPULATION TO JOIN
THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY JOINED THE COMBAT OR ARE HELPING OUR FORCES.
WE CALL ON THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS FORCED TO FIGHT AGAINST THEIR OWN
PEOPLE TO SUSPEND THE BOMBING, TO REFUSE TO CARRY OUT A GENOCIDAL
ACTION, AND TO DESERT AND JOIN OUR FORCES.  WE URGE INTERNATIONAL
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND RELIEF GROUPS TO HELP PROTECT CIVILIANS
WHO ARE BEING HARASSED BY THE ARMY OR WHO ARE IN ANY OTHER EMERGENCY
SITUATION.

   OUT WITH THE FASCISTS!  FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ LIVES!

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 OCT 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, TODAY
REFUTED THE CHARGES RAISED BY THE NONGOVERNMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS
COMMISSION THAT HIS BRIGADE HAS DEATH SQUADS AND CLANDESTINE JAILS.

   THE CHARGE, WHICH WAS RAISED ON 13 OCTOBER BY THE NONGOVERNMENTAL
HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, LINKS THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE WITH THE DEATH
SQUADS.  THE COMMISSION PRESENTED THE TESTIMONY OF CESAR VIELMAN JOYA
MARTINEZ, A FORMER SOLDIER IN THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, WHO DESCRIBED
IN A VIDEO REPORT FILMED IN MEXICO HOW THE CLANDESTINE STRUCTURES IN
THAT MILITARY GARRISON OPERATE.  ACCORDING TO JOYA, THESE CLANDESTINE
STRUCTURES ARE DIRECTED BY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS WHO KIDNAP, MURDER
AND CAUSE THE DISAPPERANCE OF LABOR UNION MEMBERS.  AFTER DENYING ALL
CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND HIS GARRISON, COL ELENA SAID THAT JOYA INDEED
SERVED IN THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE; THAT HE DESERTED WHEN HE WAS
PLACED UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR OVERRIDING HIS AUTHORITY; AND THAT IT
WAS PROVED LATER THAT ON 5 JULY, AT TRES CEIBAS CANTON, IN APOPA, HE
MURDERED A PEASANT AND TORTURED ANOTHER ONE WHO DIED LATER AT ROSALES
HOSPITAL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ELENA] THIS MAN IS A MURDERER, DESERTER, AND
THIEF.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE LEARNED ABOUT THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY HE
COMMITTED AT THE 1ST BRIGADE, WE PLACED HIM UNDER INVESTIGATION.  HE
FLED FROM THE GARRISON WHEN HE REALIZED THAT THE HIGH COMMAND HAD
ORDERED THE INVESTIGATION.

   I WISH TO STATE THAT THERE IS NO GROUP OF DEATH SQUADS AS WAS
STATED IN A CERTAIN NEWSCAST BECAUSE WE ARE PROFESSIONALS AND DO NOT
HAVE THESE KINDS OF FORCES, WHICH WE MIGHT CALL OBSCURE.  WE ACT
ACCORDING TO LAW.  THIS IS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU.

   I ALSO WISH TO STATE THAT I HAVE HERE IN MY HANDS A RECORD THAT WAS
BUILT SINCE THE FIRST DAY THIS INDIVIDUAL COMMITTED THE ABUSES OF
AUTHORITY.  HE WAS TAKEN TO AN OPERATION IN THE NEJAPA AREA WHERE HE
CAPTURED EIGHT PEOPLE AND MURDERED ONE.  HE THEN TOOK THEM TO THE 1ST
BRIGADE AND ONE OF THEM WAS SEVERLY BEATEN.  [END RECORDING]

   THE NATIONAL GUARD IS IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING THESE MURDERS AND
THE CASE IS AT THE 1ST PEACE COURT, ACCORDING TO COL ELENA.  THE
DESERTER WAS RECRUITED DURING FEBRUARY 1989, COMMITTED THE MURDERS ON
5 JULY, AND DESERTED FROM THE 1ST BRIGADE IN AUGUST.  BASED ON THE
VIDEO REPORT, HE MAY BE LIVING IN MEXICO, FROM WHICH -- IT WAS HINTED
-- THE FORMER SOLDIER'S EXTRADITION MAY BE REQUESTED.

   FINALLY, COL ELENA DENIED THAT ANY CLANDESTINE JAILS HAVE EVER
EXISTED IN HIS MILITARY GARRISON.  HE ALSO DENIED THAT A FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION] WOMAN LEADER BY THE
LAST NAME OF CHAN CHANG IS BEING HELD PRISONER THERE.
