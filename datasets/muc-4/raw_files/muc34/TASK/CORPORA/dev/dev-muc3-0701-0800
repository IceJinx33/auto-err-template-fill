   CLANDESTINE, 12 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE
RECEIVED A LAST MINUTE REPORT FROM SAN MIGUEL.  WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED
THAT, PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION, DURING CLASHES WITH THE ENEMY IN LA
ESMERALDA NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN MIGUEL, OUR REBEL ARMY CONFISCATED THREE
22-MM RIFLES, TWO .38-CAL PISTOLS, ONE 22-MM PISTOL, AND ONE CZECH
PISTOL.  ON 6TH EAST STREET OF THE CITY, AN ENEMY OFFICER AND A
SERGEANT WERE KILLED AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED.  WE REPEAT, TWO
SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED AT 6TH EAST STREET IN SAN MIGUEL.  ONE OF THE
SOLDIERS SURRENDERED TO THE PEOPLE BECAUSE HE WAS WOUNDED.  THERE IS A
MARKED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ENEMY AND OUR GUERRILLA ARMY.  WHEN
FASCIST TROOPS CAPTURE WOUNDED REBELS IN SAN SALVADOR, THEY QUESTION
THEM FIRST AT THE NATIONAL GUARD AND 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS
AND THEN MURDER THEM.  OUR ARMY RESPECTS THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS.

   WE CONTINUE OUR SAN MIGUEL REPORTING.  AT 1030 TODAY, WE DESTROYED
A LIGHT TANK ON 6TH NORTH AVENUE THEREBY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF
LIGHT TANKS THAT WE HAVE DESTROYED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.  OTHER
REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY RADIO VENCEREMOS INDICATE THAT THE
TOTAL NUMBER OF CASUALTIES IN ZACATECOLUCA AS OF 1618, IS 45,
INCLUDING TWO SECTION CHIEFS.  HEAVY FIGHTING CONTINUES IN
ZACATECOLUCA NEIBORHOODS.  IN SOYAPANGO, WHERE WE HAD RECEIVED A
REPORT OF 50 CASUALTIES, WE HAVE NOW BEEN INFORMED THAT THE NUMBER OF
CASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE ENEMY HAS INCREASED TO 70.  WE HAVE
INFLICTED 70 CASUALTIES ON AIR FORCE COMMANDER GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL
BUSTILLO'S CRIMINAL AIR FORCE.  THIS NUMBER INCLUDES AN OFFICER.  WE
HAVE INFLICTED 10 CASUALTIES ON THE TREASURY POLICE FORCES. WE HAVE
RECEIVED REPORTS THAT 3 HELICOPTERS WERE DAMAGED IN SOYAPANGO WHERE
CLASHES HAVE ENSUED AND CONTINUE AT 1619.  REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR
AND SAN MIGUEL INDICATE THAT AT THIS TIME CLASHES ARE INCREASING IN
INTENSITY IN BOTH PLACES.  A FEW MINUTES AGO, WE RECEIVED A REPORT
FROM SAN MIGUEL THAT OUR COMRADES WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS AND FORCING THE
3D INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS TO WITHDRAW.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] A GUERRILLA MEMBER DIED
ON SATURDAY 11 NOVEMBER WHILE ATTACKING THE RESIDENCE OF LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY VICE PRESIDENT ROBERTO ANGULO, WHO ESCAPED THE ATTACK
UNHARMED.

   ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, URBAN GUERRILLA MEMBERS ENTERED THE
RIGHT-WING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) LEADER'S RESIDENCE
WHERE SEVERAL SHOTS WERE FIRED, BUT THERE ARE NO OFFICIAL REPORTS ON
THE CASUALTIES.

   THE RESIDENCE IS LOCATED IN CAMPESTRE NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS
LOCATED IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR, CLOSE TO SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE AND THE PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE, WHICH WERE
ALSO ATTACKED LAST EVENING.

   ARMED FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE CONFIRMED THE
ATTACK ON CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE, BUT THE PRESIDENT ESCAPED UNHARMED
AND IS IN A SAFE PLACE.

   ANGULO'S NEIGHBORS SAID THAT THE DEPUTY WAS NOT INJURED BECAUSE HE
MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE, FROM WHERE SEVERAL PEOPLE
OPENED FIRE AGAINST THE REBELS.

   ONE OF THE ATTACKING GUERRILLAS DIED IN FRONT OF ANGULO'S RESIDENCE
AND HIS BODY WAS FOUND THIS MORNING.

   CONGRESS PRESIDENT RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO'S HOUSE WHICH IS
LOCATED IN MIRAMONTE NEIGHBORHOOD IN WESTERN SAN SALVADOR WAS ALSO
ATTACKED.

   THE REBELS ALSO ATTACKED THE "GENERAL ARCE" NEIGHBORHOOD, A
MILITARY HOUSING COMPLEX, AS WELL AS THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE
HEADQUARTERS AND THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS IN "ZACAMIL," ONE OF
THE MOST DENSELY-POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.


DEV-MUC3-0703 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] GOOD AFTERNOON, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  ON 19
MARCH, OUR GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO
DEMANDED POLITICAL STABILITY, PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE, AS WELL AS
JUDICIAL AND SOCIAL SECURITY IN OUR COUNTRY.  THESE IRRATIONAL ACTIONS
THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS
UNLEASHED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, AND PARTICULARLY AS OF YESTERDAY, MAKE
IT NECESSARY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC TO TAKE ACTION, TO
TAKE FIRM ACTION WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF OUR COUNTRY.

   WE MUST ACCEPT THE PEOPLE'S MANDATE OF 19 MARCH, AND THE GOVERNMENT
MUST NOW RESPOND WITH FIRM ACTION, WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK.  WE
MUST RESPOND BECAUSE THE FMLN IS ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION --
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE -- IN A BRUTAL AND SAVAGE MANNER.  THE ARMED
FORCES OF EL SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AND THEY HAVE
CONTROLLED THE SITUATION.

   HOWEVER, THESE FMLN TERRORISTS, WHO ALREADY FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN
DEFEATED BY THE ARMED FORCES, ARE NOW BEGINNING TO CARRY OUT
INDISCRIMINATE ACTS OF TERRORISM.  THEY ARE EVEN GOING AS FAR AS
ENTERING INNOCENT HOMES TO PRESSURE FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE
THROUGH THESE HARSH TIMES THAT ALL SALVADORANS HAVE EXPERIENCED.

   THAT IS WHY WE MUST ACT FIRMLY BUT WITHIN THE LAW.  TO THIS EFFECT,
SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MET AT 1400 IN THE
PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE TO TRY TO SOLVE SOMETHING WE ARE COMPLETELY SURE IS
WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT.  WHEN WE SAT DOWN TO TALK WITH THE
MEMBERS OF THE CABINET, WE RECALLED ARTICLE 2 OF OUR CONSTITUTION,
WHICH SAYS: ALL PERSONS HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE, PHYSICAL AND MORAL
INTEGRITY, FREEDOM, SECURITY, WORK, PROPERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO BE
PROTECTED AND HAVE THEIR LIVES AND POSSESSIONS DEFENDED.

   THAT IS WHY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS THIS AFTERNOON MADE A
DECISION, BASED ON THE LEGAL MECHANISMS GRANTED TO IT BY THE
CONSTITUTION.  FIRST, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, I WILL READ ARTICLE 29 OF THE
CONSTITUTION, WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS:

   ARTICLE 29.  IN CASES OF WAR, INVASION OF THE TERRITORY, REBELLION,
SEDITION, CATASTROPHE, EPIDEMIC, OR OTHER GENERAL CALAMITY, OR IN
CASES OF GRAVE DISRUPTION OF THE PUBLIC ORDER, THE GUARANTEES
ESTALISHED IN ARTICLES 5, ARTICLE 6, SUBPARAGRAPH 1, ARTICLE 7,
SUBPARAGRAPH 1, AND ARTICLE 24 CAN BE SUSPENDED, EXCEPT WHEN REFERRING
TO MEETINGS OR GROUPS FOR RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, AND SPORTS
PURPOSES.  THE SUSPENSION CAN AFFECT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OR PART OF IT
AND WILL BE DONE THROUGH A DECREE ISSUED BY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OR
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS APPROPRIATE.  THE GUARANTEES CONTAINED IN
ARTICLE 12, SUBPARAGRAPH 2, AND IN ARTICLE 13, SUBPARAGRAPH 2, OF THE
CONSTITUTION CAN BE SUSPENDED, WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SO DECIDES
BY A THREE-FOURTHS MAJORITY VOTE OF THE ELECTED DEPUTIES, BUT THE
ADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSION DETENCION ADMINISTRATIVA SHOULD NOT BE
LONGER THAN 15 DAYS.

   THE SUSPENSION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES WILL NOT EXCEED 30
DAYS.  ONCE THIS PERIOD EXPIRES, THE SUSPENSION CAN BE EXTENDED FOR A
SIMILAR PERIOD OF TIME, THROUGH A NEW DECREE, IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT LED TO IT CONTINUE.  IF THAT DECREE IS NOT ISSUED, THE SUSPENDED
GUARANTEES WILL BE FULLY RESTORED.

   AS YOU WILL SEE, THIS ARTICLE STATES THAT IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE
BRANCH OR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS APPROPRIATE...  [CHANGES THOUGHT] FOR
THAT PURPOSE WE ACT BASED ON ARTICLE 167, NO.  6, WHICH READS: IT IS
UP TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS TO SUSPEND AND RESTORE THE
CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES MENTIONED IN ARTICLE 29 OF THIS CONSTITUTION
IF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS NOT IN SESSION.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0704 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] IN THE FIRST CASE, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS WILL IMMEDIATELY
NOTIFY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY'S DIRECTORATE BOARD OF THE REASONS FOR SUCH
A MEASURE AND THE ACTIONS THAT WERE CARRIED OUT IN REGARD TO THE MEASURE.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE JUDICIAL NORMS STATED IN
OUR CONSTITUTION, TODAY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS HAS DECIDED TO
DECLARE A STATE OF SEIGE AS A MEASURE TO PROTECT THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, WHO ARE BEING UNJUSTLY ATTACKED BY THE IRRATIONALITY AND
SAVAGERY OF THE FMLN'S TERRORISM, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC
CANNOT AND MUST NOT ALLOW.  TOMORROW WE WILL SUBMIT TO THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY'S DIRECTORATE BOARD THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING IN WHICH THE
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS TODAY DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS STATED IN ARTICLE 29 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC.

   IN THIS REGARD, WE WISH TO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE POLITICAL
PARTIES.  THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO REMAIN DOUBTFUL.  NOW IS THE TIME
FOR ALL THOSE WHO INTEND TO WORK WITHIN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM TO STATE
-- IN A CATEGORICAL MANNER -- THAT THEY ABIDE BY AND SUPPORT THE
REPUBLIC'S INSTITUTIONS AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO
WORK AND PEACEFULLY WAGE A STRUGGLE TO ATTAIN POWER.  WE CAN NO LONGER
ALLOW POLITICAL PARTIES TO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE FMLN IS OR IS
NOT TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH THE RIGHTS THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE
DEMANDED TIME AND AGAIN IN A DEMOCRATIC WAY.

   WE ALSO URGE THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS TO TELL THEIR RESPECTIVE PEOPLES
AND GOVERNMENTS OF THE TRUE NATURE OF THE FMLN AND HOW IT WANTS TO
SUBJUGATE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THEY MUST ALSO LISTEN AND CONDEMN DANIEL ORTEGA FOR WHAT HE HAS
BEEN SAYING THESE DAYS.  HE SHOULD BE CONDEMNED BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN
TRYING TO CONFUSE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BY SAYING THAT IN EL
SALVADOR THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS.
HOWEVER, EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THAT THE FMLN HAS BEEN PLANTING BOMBS,
AND SO FAR 8 CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND MORE THAN 100 HAVE BEEN
WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THAT INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM.

   IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDEMN ORTEGA AND MAKE HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR
SENDING THE WEAPONS USED TO KILL AND TO BLEED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO
DEATH.  HE SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THESE ACTIONS WHILE
TRYING TO HIDE THEM AND TO DECEIVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

   IT IS ALSO TIME TO OPENLY CONDEMN THE FMLN FOR ITS IRRATIONAL
ACTIONS.  EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT SINCE THE 1ST DAY OF THIS
ADMINISTRATION, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OFFERED TO BEGIN A
DIALOGUE PROCESS.  IT OFFERED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THROUGH RATIONAL
AND PEACEFUL MEANS, SINCE THAT IS WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANTED
AND THAT IS WHAT THEY DEMANDED ON 19 MARCH ELECTION DAY.

   WE CAN NO LONGER ALLOW THE FMLN LEADERS TO TRAVEL FREELY THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISINFORM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,
WHICH INSTEAD OF FALLING INTO THE TRAP OF DISINFORMATION SHOULD
CATEGORICALLY CONDEMN THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   WE ARE NOT ISSUING THIS CALL TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON BEHALF OF
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  WE ARE MAKING THIS CALL ON BEHALF OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAVAGERY OF INDISCRIMINATE
TERRORISM.  WE ISSUE THIS CALL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE AND WE ARE CONVINCED
THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE THIS FATE.  THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE TO BE ATTACKED WITH TERRORIST BOMBS. THEY SHOULD
NOT BE FACING THE THREATS THE FMLN IS TRYING TO CARRY OUT.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD DURING THESE LONG 10 YEARS THAT
THEY WANT PEACE, DEMOCRACY, PROGRESS, AND DO NOT WANT TO LIVE UNDER
SYSTEMS THAT ARE ALREADY OBSOLETE IN HISTORY, THAT ARE NO LONGER
JUSTIFIED OR ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME WHEN THE WORLD IS EVOLVING TOWARD
PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.

   ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE, WE ARE ASKING YOU TO CONDEMN THE FMLN'S
IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE.

   WE ALSO WANT TO TELL THE FMLN THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE SUPPORTING
THEIR PEOPLE AND WILL NEVER PERMIT TERRORIST ACTIONS TO LEAD TO
ANYTHING ELSE BUT THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT MOVEMENT THAT HAS TAINTED
OUR HISTORY.  WE WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THE WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN
EL SALVADOR IS THROUGH REASONING AND PEACEFUL MEANS AND THAT THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL CONTINUE TRYING TO ACHIEVE PEACE AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE AND WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK: THROUGH REASONING AND
PEACEFUL MEANS.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AGAIN WE URGE YOU TO REMAIN CALM. THE ARMED
FORCES ARE CONTROLLING THE SITUATION.  WE WILL SOON LIVE NORMAL LIVES
AGAIN.  HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME WE ASK ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT THE PEACE
PROCESS, TO JOIN FORCES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  THE FMLN SHOULD
FEEL THE PEOPLE'S PRESSURE AGAINST ITS IRRATIONAL ACTIONS.

   WE ARE SURE THAT WITH YOU -- THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ARMED FORCES,
AND GOVERNMENT -- WE WILL ACHIEVE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  GOD BLESS YOU
ALL.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE] [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES INFORM THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR THAT FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN LOOTING AND
ACTS OF VANDALISM IN AREAS AROUND SAN SALVADOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN
UNABLE TO FACE THE ARMY, WHICH DISMANTLED ITS PLAN TO CREATE A STATE
OF REBELLION.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, GROUPS OF VANDALS HAVE SACKED SOME SHOPPING
CENTERS, SPECIFICALLY IN SOYAPANGO, SAN SALVADOR DEPARTMENT, AS PART
OF THEIR STRATEGY TO COVER THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FMLN TERRORISTS.

   IN THIS RESPECT, THE ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS ARE COMMITTED TO
RIDDING THE ZONE OF THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS WHO SEEK INTERNATIONAL
PUBLICITY FOR THEIR CAUSE.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE MUST BE ASSURED THAT
THEIR ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONDING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER TO THE
TERRORISTS' PROVOCATION, SINCE THE SOLDIERS DEFEND THE INTERESTS OF
THE PEOPLE AND SOCIETY.  FOR THAT REASON, PEOPLE MUST REMAIN CALM.
THE ARMED FORCES REITERATE THEIR CALL ON PEOPLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES
SO THEY WILL NOT FALL PREY TO FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS AND TO HEED THE
CURFEW ORDER, WHICH WILL GO INTO EFFECT BEGINNING TODAY FROM 0800

   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 12 NOV (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN WORKERS
NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION (FENASTRAS) TODAY ACCUSED ITS COUNTRY'S ARMY
OF "UNLEASHING VIOLENCE AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY DROPPING
ROCKETS AND BOMBS FROM SALVADORAN AIR FORCE AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS
AND LEAVING A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF VICTIMS."

   IN A COMMUNIQUE DELIVERED TO MEXICAN NEWS AGENCY "NOTIMEX,"
FENASTRAS CALLED ON "INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND HUMANITARIAN
GROUPS TO DECLARE THE PLACES ATTACKED BY THE ARMY ZONES UNDER
PROTECTION TO AVOID FURTHER BLOODSHED."

   MEMBERS OF THE ARMY AND THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT HAVE
CALLED FENASTRAS A FRONT ORGANIZATION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT, (FMLN).

   ON 31 OCTOBER, TERRORISTS ATTACKED THE FENASTRAS BUILDING IN SAN
SALVADOR KILLING SEVERAL UNION LEADERS AND DESTROYING THE BUILDING.
FENASTRAS MEMBERS IN MEXICO HAVE ACCUSED DEATH SQUADS RUN BY THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES THROUGH THE NATIONAL INFORMATION DEPARTMENT OF
THE ATTACK. ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS
LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 13 NOV 89 (MOSCOW TASS) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO
REPORTS, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI DECLARED A STATE OF
SIEGE IN THE COUNTRY ON SUNDAY.  A CURFEW WAS INTRODUCED THROUGHOUT EL
SALVADOR AND CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF CIVIL RIGHTS WERE ABROGATED
AT 8 P.M.  ON SUNDAY.

   THESE MEASURES ARE EXPECTED TO STOP THE LARGE-SCALE REBEL
OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN ON SATURDAY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   OVER THE FIRST EIGHT HOURS OF COMBAT MORE THAN 400 SOLDIERS AND
OFFICERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED, AND SIX
HELICOPTERS, ONE PLANE AND TENS OF MOTOR-VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED, THE
VANCEREMOS RADIO STATION REPORTED.

   UNITS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ARE
MAINTAINING POSITIONS IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR, USULUTAN,
SACATECOLUQUE AND OTHER STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT TOWNS.

   RESIDENTS OF SAN SALVADOR SUPPORT THE REBELS DESPITE THE SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE BOMBING RESIDENTIAL AREAS.  


DEV-MUC3-0710 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] FIGHTING HAS
CONTINUED IN SAN MIGUEL.  FORCES FROM THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE HAVE
BEEN DISLODGED FROM THE URBINA BRIDGE AND MANY CASUALTIES WERE
INFLICTED ON THEM THERE.

   IN ADDITION, AS WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, A HELICOPTER WAS HIT AT THE
15 SEPTEMBER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.  IT WAS SHOT DOWN BY OUR ANTIAIRCRAFT
FIRE AT THE 15 SEPTEMBER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN SAN MIGUEL AND FELL ON THE
PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY.  LATER, ANOTHER HELICOPTER WAS DAMAGED IN SAN
MIGUEL, WHERE HELICOPTER PILOTS DO NOT WANT TO LAND BECAUSE THEY ARE
AFRAID OF OUR ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, NATIONAL POLICE POSITIONS IN NUEVA CONCEPCION,
CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, HAVE BEEN ATTACKED.  AT 0645, FIGHTING
CONTINUES.  THE MESS HALL, THE AMMUNITION WAREHOUSE, AND THE TRAINING
FIELD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.  THE GARRISON OF THE NATIONAL POLICE HAS
SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.

   FURTHER FIGHTING WAS REPORTED AT 0646 IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ
DEPARTMENT.  OUR COMRADES IN ZACATECOLUCA REPORT THAT THE FIGHTING IS
HEAVY.  WE URGE THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE TO OBTAIN WATER AND FOOD.  WE URGE
THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE AND JOIN THE RANKS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY.

   REPORTS ARE THAT THERE IS FIGHTING AT THIS MOMENT IN THE MONTSERRAT
DISTRICT, NEAR CUSCATLAN STADIUM IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE CAPITAL HAS NO
POWER AND WATER IS BECOMING SCARCE.

   WITH REGARD TO ELECTRICAL POWER, THE SITUATION IS THE SAME THROUGHOUT
THE NATION'S TERRITORY.  IN A NUTSHELL, THE HIGH COMMAND HAS COMPLETELY
LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.  THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY IN MOST OF EL
SALVADOR'S TERRITORY AND THERE IS NO TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE IT IS 100
PERCENT PARALYZED.  FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE IN DEPARTMENT CAPITALS AT
THIS MOMENT, WHILE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL FOR 30
CONSECUTIVE HOURS.  HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE IMPORTANT FACTOR NOW.  OUR
COMRADES' COMMAND ECHELONS, WHO ARE COMMUNICATING WITH US FROM THE
CAPITAL'S DISTRICTS, ARE TELLING US THAT YOUTHS ARE MASSIVELY JOINING THE
FORTIFICATION WORK -- DIGGING DITCHES, CARRYING FOOD AND AMMUNITION, AND
HANDLING LIGHT ARTILLERY PIECES AND MACHINEGUNS; IN OTHER WORDS, ALL THAT
IS NECESSARY TO FIGHT INSIDE THE CITIES AND IN THE SUBURBS.  THEIR
INCORPORATION IN ALL CITIES IS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR.

   FOR THIS REASON, WE CALL ON YOUNG PEOPLE IN ALL DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS
TO LOOK FOR OUR FORCES, TO LOOK FOR OUR COMRADES, TO ORGANIZE IN EACH
DISTRICT AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THE BRIGADES THAT WILL BE IN CHARGE OF
THE FOOD SUPPLY, TO DIG MORE DITCHES, TO BUILD ANTIAIRCRAFT SHELTERS, AND
TO SUPPLY INFORMATION, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT AT THIS MOMENT.  WE
MUST ORGANIZE THE INFORMATION NETWORK.  WE MUST HAVE VIGILANCE IN EVERY
CORNER IN EVERY DISTRICT AND NEIGHBORHOOD.

   WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT EARLY TODAY THE ARMED FORCES CARRIED OUT A
NUMBER OF SEARCHES AND ARRESTS IN THE CAPITAL.  WELL, WE CALL ON THE
POPULATION TO ORGANIZE AGAINST THE SEARCHES AND ARRESTS. ESTABLISH
VIGILANCE.  DO NOT LET THEM TAKE AWAY ANYBODY.  ARM YOURSELVES -- TAKE OUT
YOUR PISTOLS, MAKE MOLOTOV COCKTAILS WITH BOTTLES AND GASOLINE -- IN OTHER
WORDS, DEFEND YOURSELVES.

   AT 0704, IT WAS REPORTED TO US FROM SAN SALVADOR THAT FIGHTING IS
TAKING PLACE IN EL CARMEN AGAINST THE NATIONAL POLICE.  A NEW PLACE HAS
BEEN ADDED TO THOSE IN WHICH MILITARY ACTIVITY IS TAKING PLACE.

   MEANWHILE, OTHER REPORTS INDICATE THAT FMLN SNIPERS ARE HARASSING THE
ARMY'S MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CAPITAL.  THE REPORT SAYS THAT
OUR SNIPERS POSTED IN THE TALLEST BUILDINGS ARE EFFECTIVELY KEEPING THE
ARMY PATROLS AND MOVEMENTS AT BAY.  THE ARMY IS BEGINNING TO HAVE TROUBLE
EVACUATING ITS WOUNDED, BECAUSE IN THE CAPITAL EPISODES ARE NOW TAKING
PLACE WHICH HAD BEEN ONLY SEEN IN MORAZAN BEFORE; THAT IS, HELICOPTERS
FLYING IN TO PICK UP THE WOUNDED, AS THEY DID IN THE VALLEYS AND THE
PLAINS.  THIS IS HAPPENING NOW IN THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THE ARMY TROOPS
CANNOT ADVANCE INTO CERTAIN AREAS TO PICK UP THEIR DEAD AND WOUNDED, WHO
ARE VERY, VERY NUMEROUS.  THE HELICOPTERS NOW HAVE TO LAND IN SOCCER
FIELDS AND IN OTHER PLACES TO EVACUATE THE WOUNDED.  SUCH IS THE SITUATION
IN SAN SALVADOR.  AS WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, FIGHTING CONTINUES IN
VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CAPITAL, WHERE THERE ARE FMLN-CONTROLLED AREAS.


DEV-MUC3-0711 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO CIVILIAN
EYEWITNESSES, SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS BOMBED THE UNIVERSITY'S SCHOOL OF
MEDICINE.

   THE SAME SOURCES REPORTED THAT SOLDIERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE
CAPTURED AND BLINDFOLDED 10 UNIVERSITY GUARDS YESTERDAY AND THEN TOOK THEM
OFF THE CAMPUS.

   ACCORDING TO THESE EYEWITNESSES, ARMY TROOPS ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY OF
EL SALVADOR USING AN ARMORED VEHICLE AND A 105-MM CANNON.  THEY SAID THAT
THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS BOMBED LATER ON.  HOWEVER, OFFICIAL SOURCES
HAVE NEITHER CONFIRMED NOR DENIED THIS REPORT.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE ACCUSED THE UNIVERSITY
OF EL SALVADOR OF BEING A GUERRILLA "SANCTUARY" AND HAVE SAID THAT THE 1ST
INFANTRY BRIGADE WAS ATTACKED FROM THE CAMPUS.

   IN ADDITION, THESE EYEWITNESSES SAID THAT 10 UNIVERSITY "GUARDS" WERE
CAPTURED ON CAMPUS, WHICH IS LOCATED NEAR THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, ONE OF
THE GARRISONS ATTACKED BY THE GUERRILLAS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE REBEL
OFFENSIVE BEGUN ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER.

   ACCORDING TO THESE SOURCES, THE SOLDIERS SEIZED PROPAGANDA MATERIAL.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) BEGAN AN OFFENSIVE
ON 11 NOVEMBER, WHICH HAS INCLUDED AN ATTACK ON THE HOMES OF IMPORTANT
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THAT OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI.

   ON THE SAME NIGHT, THE REBELS ALSO ATTACKED THE NATIONAL POLICE
HEADQUARTERS IN ZACAMIL, ONE OF THE MOST POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS MILITARY POSITIONS IN A DOZEN
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS LOCATED IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF THIS CAPITAL. THE
FIGHTING THEN SPREAD TO SANTA ANA, CABANAS, LA PAZ, SAN VICENTE, SAN
MIGUEL, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTH, CENTRAL, AND
EASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE REBEL OFFENSIVE HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES --
APPROXIMATELY 300 ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, AND 400 ACCORDING TO THE
GUERRILLAS.  THIS COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE A STATE OF SIEGE AND
A CURFEW THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.


DEV-MUC3-0712 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] THIS IS A LAST
MINUTE REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL.  ATTENTION, OUR PEOPLE, AND ALSO OTHER
FRATERNAL PEOPLES WHO ARE LISTENING TO US IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE
WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN LATIN AMERICA.  ATTENTION.  AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS
ARE NOW BOMBING AND FIRING ROCKETS AT VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL.

   A HELICOPTER IS BOMBING A STRETCH OF THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY NEAR
CIUDAD DELGADO, AND THERE ARE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AS A RESULT OF THIS
CRIMINAL ACTION BY THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE.  AT 0933 TODAY A HELICOPTER
BOMBED HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS IN CIUDAD DELGADO.  

   AT 0900, MORE THAN 30 MINUTES AGO, A C-47 PLANE FITTED WITH
.50-CALIBER MACHINEGUNS STRAFED DOWNTOWN MEJICANOS.  MEANWHILE, AN
A-37 PLANE, WHICH IS A FIGHTER-BOMBER PLANE KNOWN AS DRAGONFLY, FITTED
WITH ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND 7.62-MM MACHINEGUNS AND CAPABLE OF DROPPING
BOMBS OF 200, 500, AND EVEN 750 POUNDS, ALONG WITH A PUSH- PULL PLANE,
ALSO FITTED WITH ROCKETS, BOMBED THE AREA NEAR THE MARIONA JAIL TO THE
NORTH OF THE CAPITAL.

   WE ARE DENOUNCING THESE CRIMINAL ACTIONS OF THE FASCIST REGIME HEADED
BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND ROBERTO D'AUBUISSION IN THE CAPITAL.  THESE
BOMBINGS ARE UNPRECEDENTED IN SAN SALVADOR.  IN PREVIOUS YEARS, WE HAVE
DENOUNCED BOMBINGS IN RURAL AREAS.  THE AERIAL DEATH SQUAD, HEADED BY THE
GENOCIDAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLOS SINCE THE WAR BEGAN, HAS CAUSED HUNDREDS
OF DEATHS, INCLUDING MUTILATIONS AND INJURIES.

   NOW, BEFORE THE VERY EYES OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS AND DIPLOMATS
ACCREDITED IN SAN SALVADOR, AND A MILLION INHABITANTS IN THE CAPITAL, THE
AIR FORCE IS BOMBING POOR NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CAPITAL.  WE ARE TOLD THAT
A HELICOPTER HAS BEEN BOMBING THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY IN CIUDAD
DELGADO.  THESE HELICOPTERS FITTED WITH ROCKETS ARE KNOWN AS UH-1H.  THEY
HAVE BEEN MODIFIED AND ARE FITTED WITH 7.62-MM MACHINEGUNS AND
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES.  THIS U.S.-MADE HELICOPTER HAS BEEN DROPPING

   IN SUM, A C-47 PLANE MACHINEGUNNED DOWNTOWN MEJICANOS, AND AN A- 37
PLANE AND A PUSH-AND-PULL PLANE, WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS 0-2 PLANE, BOMBED
THE MARIONA AREA.  

   A LAST MINUTE REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL AT 1541 GMT:  OUR FORCES CONTINUE
TO ADVANCE IN SAN SALVADOR.  FMLN UNITS HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF A PART OF
THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, THE TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE OLIGARCHY
WITH THE MOST WELL-KNOWN SURNAMES LIVES, A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE MOST
LUXURIOUS MANSIONS AND THE LATEST MODEL CARS.  OUR MEN HAVE TAKEN UP
POSITIONS IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, EXACTLY ATOP THE SAN SALVADOR
ARCHBISHOPRIC.  OUR MEN REPORTED THAT AT 1530 THEY TOOK CONTROL OF A PART
OF THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE CAPITAL.  THEY ARE
ALSO MOVING IN TO TAKE UP POSITIONS AT THE PABLO ARNOLDO GUZMAN NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE IN MEJICANOS.  POSITIONS HAVE BECOME CONSOLIDATED
IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CITY, AND CLASHES CONTINUE AROUND THE NATIONAL
POLICE GARRISONS IN ZACAMIL AND CUSCATANCINGO.

   CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE REAFFIRM OUR
APPEAL TO HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, THE OAS, AND DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENTS, AND WE MAKE A SPECIAL CALL TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR
ARIAS, NOBEL PEACE PRIZE LAUREATE, TO CONTACT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
AND THE HIGH COMMAND OF THE FASCIST ARMED FORCES TO PRESSURE THEM TO
STOP THEIR BOMBINGS.

   INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS HAVE ALREADY CONFIRMED THAT THESE BOMBINGS
ARE TAKING PLACE IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS OF THE CAPITAL.  WE LEARNED
THAT VIDEO REPORTS ARE ALREADY GOING AROUND THE WORLD SHOWING IMAGES OF
THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.  THE BOMBINGS DESTROYED SOME BUILDINGS THERE AND
SOME HOUSES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE CAPITAL.  THERE ARE DOZENS OF CIVILIAN
CASUALTIES.

   THERE WERE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS THIS MORNING IN SAN MIGUEL'S
ESMERALDA NEIGHORHOOD AND IN OTHER NEIGHORHOODS.  AT ABOUT 0900, A PLANE
DROPPED A BOMB THAT HIT A CIVILIAN HOME IN SAN MIGUEL.  A 12- YEAR-OLD
GIRL WAS INJURED IN SOYAPANGO.

   WE CALL ON DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS, THE UNITED NATIONS, AND THE OAS TO
PRESSURE THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT TO STOP ITS BOMBINGS AGAINST THE PEOPLE,
TO STOP THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS.

MAURICIO VARGAS, COMMANDER OF THE 3RD INFANTRY BRIGADE] [TEXT]
[VARGAS, IN PROGRESS] ...CARRY OUT THE PERTINENT AND NECESSARY ACTIONS
AND THUS CONTRIBUTE TO THE STABILIZATION OF THE SITUATION SO THAT WE
MAY AGAIN ENJOY THE SAFETY AND CALM CURRENTLY BEING AFFECTED BY
TERRORIST RAIDS IN SOME AREAS AROUND SAN MIGUEL.  WE AS AN INSTITUTION
WILL GUARANTEE THAT IN THE NEXT 8 OR 10 HOURS THE PEACE YOU NEED WILL
BE REGAINED.  THIS IS A PROMISE WE ARE MAKING, AND WE WILL KEEP IT SO
THAT YOU WILL REALLY HAVE THAT TRANQUILITY YOU NEED.  HOWEVER, I MUST
ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT ON THE STREET TO PLEASE REFRAIN FROM DOING
THIS.  IF YOU ARE OUT ON THE STREET, PLEASE DO NOT RUN IF YOU SEE
SOLDIERS.  WALK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.  YOU WILL NOT HAVE
TROUBLE.  WE DO NOT USE VIOLENCE.  WE USE MILITARY CONTROL TECHNIQUES.
WE DO NOT USE IRRATIONAL TERROR.  WE USE STRICTLY MILITARY TECHNIQUES
AND TACTICS.

   WE ASK THAT YOU REFRAIN FROM GOING OUT IN THE NEXT 8 HOURS, OR AT LEAST
STAY OFF THE STREETS.  IF YOU MUST GO OUT, DO IT, BUT WALK IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE STREET.  DO NOT RUN, AND DO NOT FEAR THE AUTHORITIES.  THE
AUTHORITIES ARE THERE TO PROTECT YOUR SAFETY WHICH IS BEING AFFECTED.  THE
AUTHORITIES WISH TO GIVE YOU BACK YOUR TRANQUILITY.  I WANT YOU TO REST
ASSURED THAT WE WILL NOT FAIL YOU.  BEFORE A MARXIST-LENINIST PLAN TAKES
OVER ONE OF OUR CITIES OR TOWNS, THEY WILL HAVE TO WALK OVER THE BODIES OF
EACH AND EVERY SOLDIER. THE SOLDIERS ARE WILLING TO DEFEND EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF YOU.

   THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU.  I JUST WANTED TO SEND YOU THIS
MESSAGE OF FAITH, HOPE, AND TRUST IN YOUR GOVERNMENT AND YOUR
INSTITUTION.  THAT IS ESSENTIAL.  WE MUST NOT YIELD WHEN CONFRONTED BY
MARXIST OR COMMUNIST PLANS.  OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR ARMED FORCES NEED YOUR
SUPPORT TODAY MORE THAN EVER.  SUPPORT OUR STRUGGLE IN DEFENSE OF THE
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.  REST ASSURED THAT ALONG THIS PATH THERE IS NO RETURN.
WE EITHER ACHIEVE OUR FINAL GOAL OF CONSOLIDATION, OR WE FALL ALONG THE
PATH.  WE MUST GIVE OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC
HOMELAND.  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I WILL BE MORE THAN GLAD TO ANSWER
THEM; HOWEVER, THIS WAS THE MESSAGE I WANTED TO LEAVE WITH YOU.

BARRICADES THROUGHOUT THE CITY.  WE HAVE THE MAP OF SAN SALVADOR
SHOWING THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CITY COVERED WITH LITTLE RED FLAGS.
THESE ARE POINTS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  THESE ARE AREAS WHERE OUR FORCES ARE
ATTACKING ARMY POSITIONS AND WHERE AMBUSHES HAVE BEEN SET.  THERE ARE
FLAGS POINTING TO AREAS WHERE AMBUSHES HAVE BEEN SET, AREAS FROM WHICH
SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN DISLODGED, AND AREAS UNDER FMLN CONTROL.

HOW OUR REVOLUTIONARY FORCES ARE ADVANCING.  WE SEE THESE RED AND WHITE
FLAGS IN ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN.  LIKEWISE, IN SANTA TECLA OUR FORCES ARE
MOBILIZING AND STRENGTHENING THEIR POSITIONS.

TELEVISION NEWSMAN EPIGMENIO IBARRA WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED BY A POWERFUL
BOMB TODAY, BUT IBARRA WAS NOT HURT.  

   IT IS NOT YET KNOWN WHO PLACED THE BOMB IN THE VEHICLE WHILE IBARRA WAS
AWAY.

   THE BOMB IN IBARRA'S VEHICLE EXPLODED TODAY IN AN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR
WHERE HEAVY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS IS CURRENTLY
UNDER WAY.  ON SATURDAY THE GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED THE MOST POWERFUL
OFFENSIVE IN THE PAST 8 YEARS.

   THE BLOODY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS CONTINUES TODAY
FOR THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE DAY, AND THERE HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 400
CASUALTIES INCLUDING SOLDIERS, REBELS, AND CIVILIANS.

   TODAY, MONDAY, SAN SALVADOR IS PRACTICALLY AT A STANDSTILL DUE TO THE
FIGHTING AND THE "TRANSPORTATION STRIKE" CALLED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, WHICH ON SATURDAY LAUNCHED ITS LARGEST MILITARY
OFFENSIVE SINCE 1981.

   ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES, 127 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 240
WOUNDED SINCE THE FIGHTING BEGAN.  FOR THEIR PART, THE GUERRILLAS CLAIM
THAT THEY HAVE INFLICTED MORE THAN 400 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY, BUT HAVE
PROVIDED NO FIGURES ON LOSSES OR ON THE DEAD AND INJURED AMONG ITS RANKS.

CIVILIANS, MORE THAN 200 SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN
FIERCE CLASHES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT NIGHT SINCE 11 NOVEMBER IN THE
CAPITAL AND SEVERAL KEY SALVADORAN CITIES.  

   THE SOURCE ADDED THAT THERE COULD BE MORE THAN 300 WOUNDED CIVILIANS
AND MILITARY MEN.

   COPREFA STATED THAT 127 GUERRILLAS AND ABOUT 50 ARMY TROOPS WERE
REPORTED DEAD EARLY THIS MORNING, BUT THE FIGURES ARE GROWING BECAUSE
STRONG FIGHTING CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NORTHERN AREA OF THE
CAPITAL AND THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN AREA.

   THE ROSALES HOSPITAL, THE MAIN ONE IN THE CAPITAL, WAS ASSISTING MORE
THAN 100 CIVILIANS WOUNDED IN THE INTENSE CLASHES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE
SINCE 11 NOVEMBER WHILE MEDICAL AUTHORITIES ARE CALLING ON DOCTORS AND
NURSES TO HELP THE WOUNDED.

   ANOTHER 100 WOUNDED WERE TAKEN TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY HOSPITAL AND
ABOUT 100 MORE WERE TAKEN TO OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE CAPITAL AND
COUNTRYSIDE.

   MEANWHILE, THE SANTA TERESA HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA, 56 KM EAST OF THE
CAPITAL, WAS OCCUPIED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) GUERRILLAS THIS MORNING.  FIGHTING INTENSIFIED IN THE IMMEDIATE
AREA THIS MORNING.

   THERE WAS FIERCE FIGHTING IN ZACATECOLUCA TODAY AND ACCORDING TO PRESS
REPORTS, 13 BODIES WERE SEEN ON THE STREETS; EIGHT GUERRILLAS, FOUR
SOLDIERS, AND A CIVILIAN.

   THE GUERRILLAS, WHO, CARRYING AK-47 RIFLES AND PISTOLS, HAVE ASKED FOR
WATER AND FOOD IN SOME HOUSES, HAVE OCCUPIED FIVE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN
MIGUEL, THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT CITY IN THE COUNTRY, 140 KM FROM THE
CAPITAL.  SAN MIGUEL AND ZACATECOLUCA HAVE NO ELECTRICITY OR WATER TODAY.

   ACCORDING TO GUERRILLA SOURCES, SAN VICENTE AND USULUTAN, IN THE
COUNTRY'S EAST-CENTRAL AREA, WERE SITES OF FIERCE FIGHTING THIS MORNING.

BROADCASTING TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY.  THIS LAST MINUTE REPORT STATES
THAT THE AIR FORCE HAS BOMBED AND STRAFED THE AREA ACROSS FROM THE
INCA FACTORY AND PRADOS DE VENECIA IN SOYAPANGO.  AS A RESULT OF THIS
BOMBING AND STRAFING ACTION 3 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 12 INJURED.
IN PRADOS DE VENECIA HOUSES HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED.

   ATTENTION, WE CALL THIS INFORMATION TO THE ATTENTION OF THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, AND INTERNATIONAL
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS.  THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS AS A RESULT OF THE
BOMBINGS IN SAN SALVADOR IS INCREASING.  ACROSS FROM THE INCA FACTORY AND
PRADOS DE VENECIA IN SOYAPANGO, THE AIR FORCE IS INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING
AND STRAFING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  ATTENTION, THE REPORT WE HAVE
RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR ADVISES US THAT 3 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND
12 INJURED AND HOUSES DESTROYED IN PRADOS DE VENECIA AS A RESULT OF THE
INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING BY THE AIR FORCE.  

   THE GENOCIDAL AND COWARDLY ATTITUDE OF THE AIR FORCE, BOMBING AREAS
JUST LIKE ANASTASIO SOMOZA DID DURING THE LAST DAYS OF HIS DICTATORSHIP,
IS SHOWING THE WORLD:

   1.  THE FASCIST NATURE OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S REGIME.  THE FASCIST
NATURE OF LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN
GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMNY] HAS REMOVED THE CIVILIAN MASK OFF
THE GOVERNMENT'S FACE AND SHOWN ITS REAL MILITARY AND FASCIST FACE.

   2.  THESE BOMBINGS PROVE THAT AS THE HOURS GO BY THEY BECOME MORE
DESPERATE AND HAVE LOST TOTAL CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.  THE PROMISES
MADE BY CRISTIANI AND THE DEFENSE MINISTER THAT THEY WOULD GET THE
SITUATION UNDER CONTROL ON SATURDAY HAS FAILED.  ON SATURDAY NIGHT
COLONEL [RENE] PONCE PROMISED TO BRING THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL ON
SATURDAY NIGHT, HOWEVER, MORE THAN 32 HOURS HAVE GONE BY AND THE ARMED
FORCES AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP THE
REVOLUTIONARY ADVANCE IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, AND THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] MILITARY
POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR ARE BEING CONSOLIDATED AFTER MORE THAT 32 HOURS
OF UNINTERRUPTED FIGHTING.  THE PLAN FOR THE DEFENSE OF SAN SALVADOR HAS
FAILED.  THE U.S. ADVISERS AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE BEEN PREPARING THIS
PLAN FOR MONTHS.  WE HEREBY ADVISE THE PEOPLE THAT THE PLAN FOR THE
DEFENSE OF SAN SALVADOR HAS FAILED.  THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PREVENT OUR
FORCES FROM ARMING AND GETTING SUPPLIES; THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO STOP OUR
FMLN FORCES FROM ENTERING SAN SALVADOR, AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
STOP OUR ADVANCE OR RECOVER A SINGLE INCH OF THE CITY OCCUPIED BY THE
FMLN.  WE CAN STATE THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WIN BACK A
SINGLE INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER OUR CONTROL IN MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE,
CUSCATANCINGO, ZACAMIL, UNIVERSITARIA NORTE, OR SOYAPANGA.  THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADVANCE A SINGLE INCH.  EVERY SINGLE STEP IN
AN ATTEMPT TO WIN BACK THE NEIGHBORHOODS WE OCCUPY HAS COST THEM DEARLY IN
DEAD AND WOUNDED.

THE 27 SEPTEMBER NEIGHBORHOOD IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT.  DMIFA
SOLDIERS CONTINUE TO INFLICT CASUALTIES AMONG THE CIVILIANS, AS A RESULT
OF THEIR DESPERATION.

IN SOYAPANGA AND PRADOS DE VENECIA, WHERE IT HAS KILLED 3 AND WOUNDED 12

RESULT OF THE INDISCRIMINATE STRAFFING BY THE ARMED FORCES.

RESORTED TO THE STRATEGY OF DISINFORMATION SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN

THIS IS TOTALLY FALSE.

   THE ARMED FORCES CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE CIVILIAN RESIDENTS OF SAN

COOPERATE WITH THE ARMED FORCES AND THE VARIOUS SECURITY CORPS WHEN
NECESSARY -- MAKING SURE THIS COOPERATION INVOLVES ARMY MEMBERS OR
DULY AUTHORIZED JUDICIAL OFFICIALS.

   2. UPON LEARNING THAT ARMED TERRORISTS ARE OPERATING NEAR YOUR AREAS OF
RESIDENCE, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY CALL TELEPHONE NUMBER 123 OR NOTIFY THE
NEAREST MILITARY POST.

   3. THE POPULATION MUST REMAIN CALM AND GO TO WORK, WHILE AT THE SAME
TIME MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE IN YOUR RESPECTIVE RESIDENCES WHEN THE
CURFEW GOES INTO EFFECT AT 1800.

   4. THE SALVADORAN POPULATION MUST REMAIN IN THEIR RESIDENCES AND STAY
OFF THE STREETS, EVEN UPON HEARING THAT AN ANTISUBVERSIVE OPERATION IS
TAKING PLACE NEARBY -- THIS IS PARTICULARLY NECESSARY FOR MINORS.

   5.  THE SALVADORAN POPULATION ENGAGED IN COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES,
PARTICULARLY THE SALE OF STAPLES, MUST REMEMBER THAT THERE IS A DECREE
THAT FORBIDS MARKING UP PRICES, SINCE THIS WOULD BE AN ANTIPATRIOTIC
ACTION DURING THESE CRUCIAL TIMES FOR THE COUNTRY.

   6.  THE SALVADORAN POPULATION MUST REMAIN ALERT TO THE INFORMATION
BEING ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, BECAUSE IT WILL
BE PROVIDED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND ACCORDING TO THE TRUTH.  THE

DEV-MUC3-0724 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT DENOUNCES BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THE MEDDLING
OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT IN THE ACT OF AGGRESSION AGAINST THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE AT THE HANDS OF FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORIST GROUPS.  IN A SPEECH ON 12 NOVEMBER,
NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA OPENLY MADE IRRESPONSIBLE
STATEMENTS REGARDING DEVELOPMENTS IN EL SALVADOR WHICH ARE TOTALLY
REMOVED FROM REALITY.  PRESIDENT ORTEGA SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT IS ATTACKING THE PEOPLE WHEN THE TRUTH IS THAT THE FMLN
UNLEASHED THIS TERRORIST ESCALATION BY USING WEAPONS AND AMMUNITIONS
SUPPLIED BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT.

   THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE SANDINIST
GOVERNMENT'S MEDDLING IN THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
MORE CLOSELY.  THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT MAJOR CRIMES HAVE BEEN PLANNED ON
NICARAGUAN TERRITORY, EVEN AGAINST FMLN LEADERS.  THE LATE TOP FMLN
LEADER, CAYETANO CARPIO, ORDERED THE MURDER OF MELIDA ANAYA MONTES, WHOM
THE REBELS CALLED COMMANDER ANA MARIA FROM NICARAGUA.  FMLN COMMANDER
JOAQUIN VILLALBOS, WHO ORDERED THE MURDER OF MARXIST POET ROQUE DALTON
GARCIA, CONTINUES TO LIVE IN NICARAGUA.  THE MARXIST - LENINIST CONSPIRACY
WHICH WANTS TO SUBJECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO A TOTALITARIAN
DICTATORSHIP IS PLANNED, LED, AND IMPLEMENTED ON NICARAGUAN TERRITORY.

   HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE SUFFERED FOR MANY YEARS FROM
THE BLOODTHIRSTY FMLN ATTACKS, KNOW THAT FMLN IS THE ONE WHO HAS CRUELLY
MURDERED CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND THE ELDERLY, AND HAS NOT RESPECTED SEX OR
AGE.  THIS IS THE FMLN THAT IS MERCILESSLY ATTACKING THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.  AT PRESENT, THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE FULFILLING THEIR
CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE TO PROTECT AND DEFEND LIVES AND THE PROPERTIES OF
SALVADORAN SOCIETY.  THE FMLN HAS FAILED IN ITS TERRORIST OFFENSIVE.  IT
ENTERED THE CITY, THE WAY ALL COWARDS ENTER TO KILL BY SURPRISE AND IN
COLD BLOOD DEFENSELESS PEOPLE.

   HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE'S ARMED WING, NAMELY, THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES,
HAVE REPELLED THE AGGRESSORS WHO ARE BEING DIRECTED FROM NICARAGUA WITH
PROFESSIONALISM. SO FAR, NOT ONE OF THE COWARDLY FMLN LEADERS HAS SHOWN UP
IN SALVADORAN TERRITORY.  THESE CRIMINALS HAVE PUSHED THEIR MURDEROUS
HOARDES TO INDISCRIMINATELY FIRE AT THE ENTIRE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE CONDEMNED, REJECTED, AND REPUDIDATED THE FMLN'S
TERRORIST ATTACK.  

   THE MURDEROUS LEADERS BELIEVED THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD RALLY BEHIND AND
ACCOMPANY THEM IN THEIR FAILED REBELLIOUS OFFENSIVE; THEY TRIED TO HAND
OUT WEAPONS IN SOME TOWNS. JUST AS THE PEOPLE TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THE
TERRORISTS AT THE POLLS, THEY REJECT THEM NOW ONCE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY KNOW
THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR HUNGER, POVERTY, AND SUFFERING.
TO THE FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD WHO RESPECT THE PRINCIPLE OF
NONINTERVENTION IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF STATES, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
AND GOVERNMENT DEMAND THE CONDEMNATION OF THE MEDDLING BY THE SANDINIST
GOVERNMENT WITH ITS LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE FMLN AND THAT NICARAGUA
STOPS LENDING ITS TERRITORY FOR THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THIS NATION THAT
WANTS TO LIVE PEACEFULLY IN DEMOCRACY BASED ON A RESPECT FOR THE LAW AND
FULL LIBERTY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER]
COLONEL PONCE, WHAT IS THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR
AND IN THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS?

   [PONCE] GOOD EVENING, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE ARMED FORCES WANT TO
PUBLICLY RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR COOPERATION DURING
THIS TIME WHEN THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
TERRORIST HORDES ARE CARRYING OUT AN ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST ALL OF
OUR PEOPLE.

   THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:  FIGHTING
IS ONGOING IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR -- IN MEJICANOS,
CUSCATANCINGO, AND THE ZACAMIL AREAS.  THERE ARE ALSO SOME CLASHES IN THE
NORTHWESTERN AREA OF SOYAPANGO, IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF BOSQUES DEL
RIO, MONTE FRESCO, EL PETETE, AND SAN JOSE.

   THERE IS SOME SPORADIC FIGHTING IN CIUDAD CREDISA, AS WELL AS IN SANTA
MARTA.  THAT IS WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU AT THIS MOMENT ABOUT THE FIGHTING IN
THE AREA OF SAN SALVADOR.  

   IN THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS, ON SATURDAY, 11 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS FIGHTING
IN SAN MIGUEL, SANTA ANA, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND SOME SPORADIC
FIGHTING IN CHALATENANGO.  OF ALL THESE PLACES, THE TERRORISTS INCREASED
THEIR AGGRESSION TODAY ONLY IN ZACATECOLUCA.  THE TERRORISTS,
UNFORTUNATELY, TOOK OVER THE HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA, KILLING ONE SOLDIER
WHO WAS RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT.  THE ARMED FORCES HAVE REGAINED
CONTROL OF THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOORS OF THE HOSPITAL.  APPROXIMATELY 10
TO 15 TERRORISTS ARE ON THE THIRD AND FOURTH FLOORS, AND THE TROUBLE IS
THAT THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE ON THOSE FLOORS.

   SO, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED AGGRESSION, THE INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM
THAT THE FMLN HAS LAUNCHED AT THIS TIME IN AN IRRATIONAL MANNER AGAINST
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, HAS BEEN CONTROLLED.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE FIGHTING
IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER AGAINST THESE TERRORISTS.  

   [REPORTER] TO SUM UP, WE COULD THEN SAY THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW
GUERRILLA RESISTANCE POCKETS IN THE AREAS THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED.  THIS
CONTRADICTS THE REPORTS FROM THE CLANDESTINE RADIO STATIONS TO THE EFFECT
THAT THEY CONTROL CERTAIN AREAS.

   [PONCE] I MUST ALSO ADD THAT THERE IS ALSO SOME FIGHTING IN CIUDAD
DELGADO.  I CAN CATEGORICALLY STATE THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT CONTROL ANY
POINT IN OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY.  THEY ARE SHOUTING ABROAD THAT THEY
CONTROL CERTAIN POINTS IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, THE
MEDIA, AND THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ARE WITNESSES TO THE FACT THE FMLN
DOES NOT CONTROL ANY PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR OR IN THE OTHER
DEPARTMENTS.  THERE ARE STILL SOME FMLN REDOUBTS, WHICH WE ARE
CURRENTLY CONTROLLING IN ORDER TO EXPEL FROM THE URBAN AREAS THE
TERRORISTS WHO ARE ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   NATURALLY, WE HAVE SOME COMBAT LIMITATIONS IN THE URBAN AREAS, BECAUSE
THE TERRORISTS ARE SHIELDING THEMSELVES BEHIND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND
ARE HOLDING MANY FAMILIES HOSTAGES IN THEIR OWN HOMES. THE TERRORISTS HAVE
ALSO PLACED SNIPERS ON SOME TALL BUILDINGS. THAT IS WHY THE ARMED FORCES
ARE ASKING FOR THE PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING.  IF WE WERE TO USE OUR MILITARY
POWER, AS WE COULD DO IN A COMBAT ZONE, WE WOULD KILL MANY INNOCENT
PEOPLE.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0726 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [PONCE] AND WE NOT WANT TO
DO THAT. WE WANT TO RESOLVE THIS SITUATION IN A CAUTIOUS WAY, ALWAYS
RESPECTING AND PROTECTING OUR CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THAT IS WHY WE ASK
THOSE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED OR ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY
TERRORISTS TO BE PATIENT.  THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE MAKING AN
EFFORT TO REACH ALL THE AREAS WHERE THIS SITUATION PREVAILS SO THAT WE CAN
RESCUE ALL OF OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS.  

   [REPORTER] THESE REMARKS ARE INTENDED TO REVEAL THE PROFESSIONAL NATURE
OF THE ARMED FORCES AND REAFFIRM SOMETHING MANY SALVADORANS HAVE IN MIND.
REGARDING THIS MILITARY OFFENSIVE, HAS THE FMLN RECEIVED MILITARY AND
PERSONNEL AID FROM ABROAD?

   [PONCE] SURE, NICARAGUA HAS ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE FMLN. PRESIDENT
ORTEGA IS DOING THIS [3-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION]. THE NICARAGUAN
FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO IS CURRENTLY IN MEXICO, IS GIVING HIS FULL
SUPPORT TO THE FMLN.  HE SAYS THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES HAVE
ALREADY ACHIEVED THEIR VICTORY IN EL SALVADOR.  THE FMLN ARE LIARS.
THEY FOLLOW THE SAME COMMUNISTS' SLOGANS: LIE, LIE, AND LIE.  HERE NO
ONE BELIEVES THAT.  A TRUCK LOADED WITH WEAPONS IN SANTA ANA WAS
DRIVEN BY AN EAST GERMAN.  SOME OF THE CAPTURED PEOPLE ARE FOREIGNERS.
I CANNOT TELL YOU WHERE THEY COME FROM.

   [REPORTER] YOUR REMARKS CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF MERCENARIES IN THE
CURRENT ARMED STRUGGLE, WHICH WOULD BE....

   [PONCE, INTERRUPTING] I CAN ALSO ADD THAT WE RECEIVED INFORMATION
BEFORE 10 NOVEMBER THAT A GROUP OF TERRORIST FIGHTERS HAD COME TO THE
COUNTRY'S EASTERN ZONE FROM NICARAGUA.  THEY MAY BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS
TERRORIST ACTION.  

   [REPORTER] AS FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE FMLN
NOW, CAN YOU TELL HOW MANY FMLN REBELS HAVE DIED IN THIS OFFENSIVE?

   [PONCE] NATIONWIDE, WE COUNTED 230 TERRORISTS KILLED, AND 136 TERRORIST
WOUNDED; 72 TERRORIST WERE CAPTURED.  ONE TERRORIST WAS PRESENTED TO THE
PRESS.

   [REPORTER] CAN THE NUMBER OF CIVILIANS KILLED AND WOUNDED BE TOTALLED
NOW?

   [PONCE] THAT IS THE MOST REGRETTABLE ASPECT OF THIS IRRATIONAL FMLN
ACTION.  THIS ACTION HAS IMPERILED THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE
ARMED UPRISING.  WE REGRET THAT 17 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND 86 HAVE BEEN
WOUNDED.

   [REPORTER] THIS FIGURE IS REALLY REGRETTABLE.  MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
TUNED INTO THIS NATIONAL NETWORK.  WE HAVE HEARD MANY TELEPHONE CALLS
REITERATING SUPPORT FOR THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES'
ACTIONS.  IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY IN AREAS WHERE THE CURFEW WAS ORDERED.
WHAT SUGGESTIONS CAN YOU OFFER PEOPLE IN THE CAPITAL CITY?

   [PONCE] TO REPORT AN EMERGENCY THEY CAN DIAL 3 IF THEY HAVE A TELEPHONE
AVAILABLE.  OTHERWISE, OR IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A TELEPHONE, IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT THEY LEAVE THEIR HOMES WITH THEIR ARMS UP CARRYING SOME WHITE FLAG OR
CLOTH AND GO TO A NEARBY UNIT TO GET AID. PEOPLE MUST KEEP IN MIND THE
ARMED FORCES ARE THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE AND WILL SERVE THE PEOPLE.
TRUST AND GO TO YOUR ARMED FORCES.

   [REPORTER] THESE WERE THE REMARKS OF COL RENE EMILIO PONCE.  HE IS NOW
LEAVING THIS NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK.

   [PONCE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS HAVE BEEN
SEIZED.  WE CAN CONFIRM THE MEDDLING OF SOME COMMUNIST BLOC COUNTRIES IN
THIS. WE SEIZED RUSSIAN AND NORTH KOREAN WEAPONS WHICH PROBABLY ENTERED
THROUGH CUBA AND NICARAGUA.  I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT SINCE THE FMLN FIRED
MORTARS FROM THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY MORNING, WE
HAD TO REMOVE THE TERRORISTS FROM SEVERAL POINTS.  WE FOUND WEAPONS,
EXPLOSIVES, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF MEDICINE INSIDE THE NATIONAL
UNIVERSITY.  SOME MEN WERE KILLED WITH THEIR RIFLES IN THEIR HANDS; WE
ALSO CAPTURED OTHERS WHO WERE INSIDE THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.

   I ALSO WANT TO ASK THE CIVILIAN POPULATION FOR ITS UNDERSTANDING AND TO
TRUST THEIR ARMED FORCES.  THESE ARMED FORCES BELONG TO THE PEOPLE AND
SERVE THEM.  WE ARE ACTING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER.  BE PATIENT, REMAIN
CALM, AND WE WILL MOVE AHEAD WITH GOD'S BLESSING AND HELP.  ALSO, I WANT
TO PUBLICLY RECOGNIZE THE MILITARY CHIEFS, OFFICERS, ENLISTED MEN,
SECURITY CORPS OFFICIALS, AND ALL THE ARMED FORCES' ACTIVE PERSONNEL FOR
THEIR HEROIC WORK IN DEFENDING OUR PEOPLE, DEMOCRACY, LIBERTY, AND PEACE.
YOUR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN HEROIC, AND ALL OF US RECOGNIZE THIS.  MAY HISTORY
DO YOU JUSTICE TOMORROW.  YOU MUST FEEL PROUD BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING WHAT
EVERY PATRIOT MUST DO, DEFEND THE FATHERLAND.  


DEV-MUC3-0727 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY'S
COUNTERATTACK AGAINST REBEL POSITIONS IN MEJICANOS, ON THE NORTHERN SIDE
OF THE CAPITAL CITY, WAS SUSPENDED AT 1745 (2345 GMT), 1 HOUR AFTER IT
BEGAN AND SO FAR THERE ARE NO REPORTS ON THE RESULTS OF IT.

   TWO COLUMNS OF SOME 100 SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS, ARMED WITH RIFLES AND
ARTILLERY WEAPONS, STARTED TO ATTACK ABOUT 150 GUERRILLAS WHO CONTROL
AMPLE POSITIONS IN MEJICANOS WHERE SOME 125,000 PEOPLE LIVE.  DURING THAT
HOUR, STRONG EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD NEAR MEJICANOS; THEY LATER STOPPED WHEN
A HEAVY RAIN FELL FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

   THERE ARE NO TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE AREA; THEREFORE, IT HAS
BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE BALANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S COUNTERATTACK.

   MEANWHILE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN THE CONACASTE NEIGHBORHOOD OF
SOYAPANGO, ALSO IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, FIVE PRIVATE HOMES WERE STRAFFED
BY ARMY HELICOPTERS. THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED YET.

   ACCORDING TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR, THE NATIONAL OFFENSIVE
LAUNCHED ON 12 NOVEMBER BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) AGAINST ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT HAS RESULTED IN 305
DEAD AND 373 WOUNDED, INCLUDING GUERRILLAS, SOLDIERS, AND CIVILIANS.

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) --
[STATEMENT] [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] SINCE
1981 THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS BEEN
INSISTING ON THE NEED FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR.  ITS
EFFORTS MET WITH THE STUBBORN OPPOSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE
COUNTRY'S ULTRARIGHTIST SECTORS, WHO ARE THE ONES WHO IN REALITY HAVE
WIELDED TOTAL POWER.

   WE PRESENTED DOZENS OF NEGOTIATING PROPOSALS IN WHICH WE INCREASINGLY
MADE OUR POSITIONS MORE FLEXIBLE, EVEN THOUGH THE MILITARY REALITY
DEMONSTRATED THAT WE WERE INVINCIBLE.  WE PRESENTED TO THE CURRENT
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] GOVERNMENT A PROPOSAL THAT HAD
REAL POSSIBILITIES OF BRINGING ABOUT PEACE.  HOWEVER, THE RESPONSE WE
RECEIVED WAS AN ESCALATION OF REPRESSION BY MEANS OF TORTURE AND MURDER,
WHICH CULMINATED WITH THE MASSACRE OF THE WORKERS OF THE SALVADORAN
WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION [FENASTRAS].

   THE GOVERNMENT REJECTED OUR FORMULAS FOR NEGOTIATION IN WORD AND IN
DEED, AND INSTEAD DEEPENED THE CAUSES BEHIND THE WAR BY WORSENING THE
SOCIAL CRISIS AND REDUCING THE RANGE OF ACTIVITY OF THE POPULAR SECTORS.
FACED WITH A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT THREATENED NOT ONLY TO SHUT OFF A
PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE WAR, BUT INSTEAD TO INCREASE THE KILLINGS AND
OTHER FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF OUR PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS, THE FMLN
DECIDED TO LAUNCH A FORCEFUL AND STRATEGIC MILITARY OFFENSIVE THAT WOULD
PUT A HALT TO THE FASCISTS AND OPEN UP A POSSIBILITY TO BRING AN END TO
THE WAR.

   CONSEQUENTLY, AT 2000 ON 11 NOVEMBER OUR FORCES ENTERED INTO COMBAT
AGAINST ALL THE TARGETS DESIGNATED IN OUR OFFENSIVE PLAN, DESPITE ALL THE
PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND ARRANGEMENTS SET UP BY THE ARMY TO TRY TO HALT
US.  OUR EXPERIENCED FIGHTERS, IN SPITE OF THE DISADVANTAGE IN FORCES AND
ARMS, HAVE FULFILLED OUR GOALS BEYOND OUR EXPECTATIONS, CARRYING OUT ONE
OF THE MOST GLORIOUS MILITARY BATTLES IN THE HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S WAR.
IN UNDER 15 HOURS, WE GAINED CONTROL OVER STRATEGIC TERRITORIES, WIPED OUT
DOZENS OF ENEMY TROOPS, TOOK PRISONERS, RECOVERED WEAPONS, AND DESTROYED
ARMORED VEHICLES AND AIRPLANES.

   AFTER 4 CONTINUOUS DAYS OF FIGHTING, OUR FORCES HAVE REJECTED ALL
COUNTERATTACKS BY THE ENEMY AND HAVE GAINED NEW POSITIONS.  THOUSANDS OF
RESIDENTS OF THE CITIES HAVE STAGED POPULAR UPRISINGS TO SUPPORT OUR
FORCES, WHICH HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED BY NEW FIGHTERS.  FACED WITH THIS
SITUATION, THE ARENA GOVERNMENT AND THE CLIQUE OF CORRUPT MILITARY
OFFICERS KNOWN AS LA TANDONA WHO COMMAND THE ARMED FORCES, HAVE ORDERED
CRIMINAL BOMBINGS OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION WITH THE PURPOSE OF PUTTING
DOWN THE POPULAR UPRISINGS.  THIS HAS BROUGHT ABOUT MORE SUPPORT FOR OUR
FORCES AND REDOUBLED THE PEOPLE'S RAGE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT LED BY
CRISTIANI AND THE ARMY.  A SITUATION HAS THUS COME ABOUT WHICH DEMANDS
THAT OUR FORCES CARRY OUT THE DECISION TO CONTINUE THE OFFENSIVE THAT OUR
FORCES AND THE PEOPLE HAVE UNLEASHED UNTIL ITS FINAL CONSEQUENCES.

[STATEMENT] [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] PEACE
IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF WE EVICT FROM POWER THOSE WHO HAVE PROFITED FROM
WAR.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND:

   1.  ORDERS THAT ALL OUR UNITS MUST HOLD THE POSITIONS CONQUERED,
ORGANIZE THE GENERAL UPRISING OF OUR PEOPLE, AND CARRY OUT ALL THE TASKS
DEALING WITH THE POPULATION'S SECURITY AND DEFENSE AND THE COLLECTION OF
FOOD AND ITS DISTRIBUTION TO THE NEEDY.

   2.  CALLS THE PEOPLE TO A GENERAL UPRISING SO THEY CAN JOIN US IN
BATTLE IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY WITH ALL TYPES OF WEAPONS TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES AND STRIKE THE ENEMY.

   3.  ANNOUNCES THAT, EFFECTIVE AS SOON AS THIS MANIFESTO IS ANNOUNCED,
WE DECLARE AS TERRITORIES LIBERATED BY THE PEOPLE ALL THE AREAS UNDER OUR
CONTROL IN MORAZAN, SAN MIGUEL, LA UNION, USULUTAN, CUSCATLAN,
CHALATENANGO, SAN VICENTE, AND CABANAS DEPARTMENTS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THIS, OUR FORCES AND THE PEOPLE WILL ORGANIZE POPULAR GOVERNMENTS IN EVERY
MUNICIPALITY IN THESE DEPARTMENTS.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, OUR FORCES THAT
CONTROL TERRITORIES IN THE CITIES MUST INTENSIFY THE STRUGGLE TO ENSURE
TOTAL CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY.

   4.  URGES ALL THE WORKERS TO STOP WORKING AS PART OF THE GENERALIZED
STRUGGLE, WHICH WILL HELP WEAKEN THE JANUARY GOVERNMENT AND WILL ENABLE
ALL TO JOIN US IN COMBAT.  THEREFORE, WE HEREBY ANNOUNCE THAT THE CURRENT
TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, THE SABOTAGING OF THE ENERGY SUPPLY, AND THE
CLOSING OF GASOLINE STATIONS WILL CONTINUE FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME.  FOR
THIS REASON, THE PEOPLE MUST PREPARE FOR THIS SITUATION.  WE STERNLY WARN
THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO FORCE THEIR WORKERS TO GO TO WORK THAT OUR FORCES HAVE
BEEN INSTRUCTED TO IMPOSE OBEDIENCE TO THIS MEASURE.

   5.  ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO
SEND HELP TO THE CIVILIAN VICTIMS OF BOMBINGS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE
CREATION OF REFUGES AND CENTERS TO PROTECT THE POPULATION FROM THE
CRIMINAL ACTIONS UNLEASHED BY CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES
HIGH COMMAND.

   6.  URGENTLY CALLS ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES, POPULAR
ORGANIZATIONS, AND PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN IN OUR COUNTRY TO ASSUME AT THIS
TIME THE HISTORIC ROLE OF MAKERS AND BUILDERS OF A NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC
SOLUTION THAT CAN BRING LASTING PEACE TO OUR COUNTRY.

   7.  MAKES A PATRIOTIC EXHORTATION TO OFFICERS AND THE RANK AND FILE
OF THE ARMY NOT TO LET THE BIG BATCH [LA TANDONA, THE GRADUATING CLASS
OF THE MAJORITY OF THE CURRENT ARMY STAFF MEMBERS], ARENA, AND THE
U.S.  INTERESTS LEAD THEM TO CONFRONT THE PEOPLE, THUS STAINING THEIR
HANDS WITH BLOOD.  THE FMLN DOES NOT REGARD THEM AS ENEMIES AND IS
READY TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE ARMY SECTORS WHO DESIRE JUSTICE,
SOVEREIGNTY, AND TRUE DEMOCRACY FOR OUR PEOPLE.  THE ENEMY OF THE
PEOPLE AND ALL OF OUR COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES IS LA
TANDONA, WHO HAVE ENRICHED THEMSELVES WITH WAR, AND THE ARENA DEATH
SQUADS.  THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  THEY ARE THE
ONES WHO DO NOT WANT A REGIME OF JUSTICE.  WE CALL ALL THE NATION TO
FIGHT THEM SO WE CAN SING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, WHICH THE TYRANNY HAS
TRIED TO BURY, AND WHICH SAYS: FREEDOM IS ITS DOGMA AND GUIDELINE,
WHICH IT HAS SWORN TO DEFEND A THOUSAND TIMES, AND JUST AS MANY TIMES,
HAS SWORN TO REJECT THE HATEFUL POWER OF A BOLD TYRANNY.

SALVADOR: A GOVERNMENT THAT BOMBS THE PEOPLE IS AN ILLEGITIMATE
GOVERNMENT; A GOVERNMENT FACING THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS IN ARMS IS AN
ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT; AND A GOVERNMENT THAT MASSACRES THE PEOPLE IS
AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT; AND AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT MUST BE
TOPPLED BY OUR FORCES.

   NOW, WE HAVE A LAST-MINUTE REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR.  AT THIS VERY
MOMENT, AN O-2 AIRPLANE IS THROWING ROCKETS AT THE AREA OF ZACAMIL,
WHERE HEAVY FIGHTING IS UNDER WAY.  IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THERE
HAVE BEEN CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THIS ATTACK.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN
CONFIRMED THAT THE THREE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS THAT WERE
DESTROYED IN ZACAMIL WERE DESTROYED ON THE STREET THAT JOINS THE
ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE METROPOLI NEIGHBORHOOD.

   IN ANOTHER REPORT FROM OUR COMPANEROS IN SOYAPANGO, THEY HAVE
INFORMED US THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A U.S. ADVISER LEADING THE TROOPS IN
THE SECTOR OF SOYAPANGO.  IT IS PRESUMED THAT THIS NORTH AMERICAN IS
THE ONE WHO IS DIRECTING THE AIR ATTACK IN THE SECTOR OF SOYAPANGO.
C-47 AIRPLANES AS WELL AS UH-1M, HUEY 500, AND UH-1H HELICOPTERS, ALL
U.S. MADE, HAVE BEEN THROWING ROCKETS ON AND MACHINEGUNNING THE
SECTORS OF SOYAPANGO AND CIUDAD DELGADO.  THE FASCIST REGIME OF LA
TANDONA [NAME GIVEN TO 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY], CRISTIANI, AND D'AUBUISSON HAVE DECREED A
CURFEW IN ALL OF THE AREAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF OUR FORCES IN THE
NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO WITNESSES OF
THEIR INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING.  WE ISSUE AN URGENT CALL TO THE RED
CROSS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO GO TO SOYAPANGO, WHERE
THERE HAVE BEEN DOZENS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.  WE ALSO ISSUE AN
URGENT APPEAL TO THE DEMOCRATIC LATIN AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS SO THAT
THEY CAN [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO
CRISTIANI, TO GET HIM TO STOP THIS INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING ONCE AND FOR
ALL.

   A REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL STATES THAT FMLN FORCES THIS AFTERNOON
ARE ATTACKING ZACAMIL BATTALION POSITIONS AND HARRASSING THE ARMED
FORCES' JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.  ON THIS 4TH DAY OF FIGHTING IN THE
CAPITAL, ROADBLOCKS CONTINUE TO MULTIPLY THROUGHOUT.  THIS IS THE
SECOND ATTACK ON THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.

   AS REPORTED ON THE EVENING OF 13 NOVEMBER, WE ATTACKED THE SAN
BENITO BATTALION AT THE NATIONAL FAIR GROUNDS AND THE FORCES GUARDING
THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.  THIS IS THE SECOND HARRASSMENT ATTACK ON
THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.  THIS COMPLICATES THE ARMED FORCES'
SITUATION IN THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THE ENEMY ARMED FORCES' TOP
LEADERSHIP IS BEING ATTACKED AND HARRASSED.  FMLN FORCES ARE
BESIEGING THE ENEMY.

   AIR FORCE AIRCRAFTS CONTINUE TO OVERFLY THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE
CAPITAL THIS AFTERNOON.  THEY CONTINUE TO MACHINEGUN AND BOMB THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION.  MOMENTS AGO, WE REPORTED THAT THERE WAS HEAVY
BOMBING IN ZACAMIL AGAINST THE POPULATION.  WE CALL ON THE
INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS COMMITTEE TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO ZACAMIL TO
EVACUATE CIVILIANS WHO MIGHT HAVE SURVIVED THESE COWARDLY AND BLOODY
AIR FORCE BOMBINGS.

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE A REPORT FROM
OUR COMMANDING POST IN SAN SALVADOR.  WE HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH COMMANDER
CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO.  BECAUSE OF CERTAIN PROBLEMS WITH THE
COMMUNICATIONS, THE QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE CLEAR, BUT THE ANSWERS WILL BE.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO, WE ARE
INTERVIEWING YOU FROM RADIO VENCEREMOS HERE IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.  WE
HAVE HEARD REPORTS FROM CENTRAL AMERICAN RADIO STATIONS SPEAKING ABOUT
ROCKET FIRE AND BOMBINGS IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.  COULD YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE CURRENT SITUATION?

   [ARMIJO] WE HAVE BEEN HOLDING OUR POSITION FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  CURRENTLY, THERE IS ROCKET AND MACHINEGUN FIRE BEING
LAUNCED AGAINST OUR POSITIONS.  THE ENEMY IS DESPERATE.  THIS MORNING
WE REPELLED AN ATTACK.  THEY FLED IN DISARRAY BECAUSE NO ONE CAME TO
SUPPORT THEM.

   [REPORTER] THE FASCIST DISINFORMATION NETWORK HAS BEEN SAYING THAT
THE PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN].  WHAT IS THE PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE FMLN FIGHTERS
IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD?

   [ARMIJO] THEIR CONDUCT HAS BEEN POSITIVE.  THEY HAVE BEEN HELPING
US TREAT THE WOUNDED.  THEY HAVE HELPED US WITH FOOD PROBLEMS.  THEY
HAVE SUPPORTED US COMPLETELY BY PLACING BARRICADES ON THE STREETS.
THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT IN THIS AREA IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT
THE ENEMY'S PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.

   [REPORTER] WE HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM OUR COMRADES IN
SOYAPANGO WHO SAY THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A U.S. ADVISER LEADING ENEMY
TROOPS IN SAN SALVADOR.  HAVE ANY OF YOUR MEN SEEN ANY U.S.  ADVISERS?
[ARMIJO] [WORD INDISTINCT] NOT SEEN THEM, BUT [PASSAGE INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE MORALE OF THE FMLN TROOPS PARTICULARLY IN
THE ZACAMIL AREA?  THE FASCIST INFORMATION NETWORK HAS BEEN SAYING
THAT FMLN TROOPS ARE LEAVING THEIR POSTS.

   [ARMIJO] THEIR MORALE IS HIGH.  WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE PEOPLE'S
SUPPORT.  WE ARE VERY DETERMINED.  THE ENEMY'S ATTACKS HAVE BEEN
REPELLED.

   [REPORTER] COULD YOU SEND A MESSAGE TO FMLN TROOPS IN ZACAMIL
NEIGHBORHOOD AND TO THOSE IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE
CAPITAL AS WELL AS TO FMLN FIGHTERS HOLDING THEIR POSITIONS IN OTHER
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY?

   [ARMIJO] THE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTING US.  WE ARE WAGING ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BATTLES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.  THE OUTLOOK FOR
VICTORY DEPENDS ON WHAT EACH OF US DOES.  WE MUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD.

   THIS HAS BEEN A RECORDED INTERVIEW.  WE INTERVIEWED COMMANDER
CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO A FEW MINUTES AGO.  HE IS CURRENTLY AT A
COMMAND POST IN SAN SALVADOR.

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION,
ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THIS IS CADENA NACIONAL, THE NETWORK OF
FREEDOM, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S NETWORK.  ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE:

   THE TERRORIST HORDES OF THE FARBUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN) HAVE BEEN DEFEATED BY OUR BRAVE ARMED FORCES, WHO HAVE
GONE OUT TO DEFEND OUR SOVEREIGNTY, INTEGRITY, AND THE LIVES AND
PROPERTIES OF ALL SALVADORANS.

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING THEIR ARMED FORCES AND
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   AT THIS TIME, THE FMLN CRIMINALS ARE RECEIVING THE PUNISHEMENT THEY
DESERVE THROUGH THE GLORIOUS WEAPONS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.

   THE COWARDLY FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN HIDING SINCE 11
NOVEMBER IN THE HOMES OF DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS.  THEY ARE COWARDS.
THEY ARE LIKE THOSE COWARD CRIMINALS WHO AFTER COMMITTING MURDER RUN
TO HIDE BEHIND A WOMAN'S SKIRT.  THAT IS WHAT THOSE TERRORISTS ARE
DOING.  THEY ARE HIDING UNDER THE BEDS OF THE POPULATION, WHICH IS
SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE TERRORISTS' ATTACKS.  THEY ARE COWARDS WHO
HAVE TREACHEROUSLY ATTACKED AND BOMBED THE PEOPLE.

   A FEW HOURS AGO, THE LIAR TERRORIST JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, FROM HIS
HOTEL ROOM IN MANAGUA -- WHERE HE HAS AIR CONDITIONING AND LOTS OF
FOOD -- SAID THAT THE FMLN HAS SEIZED POSITIONS, WHICH IS NOT TRUE.
ALL TOWNS IN THE COUNTRY ARE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL CONTROL
AND UNDER THE ARMED FORCES' MILITARY CONTROL.

   WE MUST INFORM YOU THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW AREAS WHERE TERRORISTS
HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN HOUSES AND ARE ACTING AS SNIPERS.  HOWEVER, THE
ARMED FORCES ARE TRYING TO DISLODGE THEM IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER IN
ORDER NOT TO HARM CIVILIANS.

   THE COWARDS ARE HIDING IN A FEW AREAS.  WE MUST TELL YOU THAT THE
AREAS WHERE THERE IS SOME RESISTANCE ARE ILOPANGO, COLONIA SANTA
LUCIA, SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, ZACAMIL, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND CIUDAD
DELGADO.

   SALVADORANS WHO ARE IN THOSE AREAS, VICTIMS OF THE TERRORISTS: FROM
HERE YOUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS, YOUR BROTHERS IN THE ARMED FORCES, TELL
YOU THAT WE ARE AT YOUR SIDE AT THIS TIME OF STRUGGLE, DURING THIS SAD
TIME WHEN YOU ARE FACED WITH HUNGER AND DEATH THREATS BY THE FMLN
TERRORIST HORDES.  WE ARE AT YOUR SIDE, COMPATRIOT!  WE ARE WITH YOU
SALVADORAN PEOPLE!  YOUR ARMED FORCES WILL NOT ABANDON YOU.  YOU CAN
BE SURE THAT ALL THIS WILL SOON BE OVER.  WE WILL SOON DISLODGE THESE
MANGY DOGS WHO HAVE COME WITH [NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL]
ORTEGA'S WEAPONS AND TERRORIST HORDES, WHO HAVE COME HERE TO MASSACRE
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE ARE WITH YOU COMPATRIOT!  STAY WHERE YOU
ARE.  REMAIN CALM, AS YOU WILL SOON BE FREED FROM THE TERRORIST
HORDES.

   ILOPANGO, COLONIA SANTA LUCIA, SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, ZACAMIL,
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND CIUDAD DELGADO: REMEMBER THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND
CRISTIANI ARE AT THE HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT YOUR ARMED
FORCES ARE UNITEDLY, PROFESSIONALLY, AND PATRIOTICALLY STRUGGLING TO
DEFEND YOU FROM THIS BRUTAL AND BESTIAL ATTACK THAT WE DENOUNCE BEFORE
THE WORLD.

   WHY IS IT THAT NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING?  WHY DO JOURNALISTS IN EUROPE
SAY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING?  WHY DO THEY NOT TELL THE TRUTH?
THEY ONLY REPEAT THE LIES OF RADIO VENCEREMOS AND THE LIAR RADIO
FARABUNDO MARTI.  THE PEOPLE'S TRUTH IS HERE.  HERE IS THE TRUTH OF
OUR PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ENDURED THE TERRORIST ATTACKS FOR 10 YEARS!

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: BE BRAVE AND UNITED, FULL OF PATRIOTISM, AND
SURE OF OUR VICTORY.  OUR FATHERLAND IS FREE!  OUR ARMED FORCES ARE
GLORIOUSLY FIGHTING!  FORWARD, ARMED FORCES!  FORWARD, SALVADORAN
PEOPLE!  


DEV-MUC3-0741 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION, THIS IS A
LAST-MINUTE REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR: OUR FORCES HAVE OCCUPIED POSITIONS
HELD BY THE NATIONAL POLICE IN CUSCATANCINGO.  THE POLICEMEN WERE FORCED TO
FLEE IN DISARRARY FROM A POSITION THAT THEY HAD HELD IN CUSCATANCINGO,
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.

   MEANWHILE, THE ENEMY IS USING M-79 ROCKET LAUNCHERS IN DOWNTOWN
MEJICANOS.  THE MARKET AREA AND THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.

   WE REPEAT: A NATIONAL POLICE POSITION WAS ATTACKED BETWEEN 1310 AND
1350 [1910 AND 1950 GMT].  THE POLICEMEN, WHO ARE EXCELLENT AT
REPRESSING THE PEOPLE AND THE COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS, FLED
CUSCATANCINGO IN DISARRAY AFTER BEING ATTACKED BY FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT FORCES.

   AT 1407 [2007 GMT], AN A-37 DRAGONFLY PLANE OVERFLEW AYUTUXTEPEQUE,
MEJICANOS, AND ZACAMIL.  OUR FIGHTERS ARE TRAINED TO FIRE AT THESE
PLANES.  THIRTY MINUTES AGO, A PUSH-AND-PULL 0-2 PLANE DROPPED BOMBS
ON ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD AND A C-47 MACHINEGUNNED THE AREA.

   AN A-37 PLANE IS NOW OVERFLYING NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AFTER OUR
COMRADES OCCUPIED A POSITION THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE HAD HELD IN
CUSCATANCINGO.  


DEV-MUC3-0742 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] POLITICAL AND
DIPLOMATIC SOURCES TODAY REVEALED THAT THE GUERRILLAS TRIED TO KIDNAP
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND OTHER OFFICIALS OF THE
RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT ON 11 NOVEMBER WHEN THEY LAUNCHED THE LARGEST
MILITARY OFFENSIVE OF THE PAST 10 YEARS.

   A NEIGHBOR OF THE PRESIDENT IN THE LUXURIOUS RESIDENTIAL AREA OF
"MAQUILISHUAT," IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, SAID THAT "THE GUERRILLAS
MANAGED TO ENTER PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S HOME, BUT COULD NOT KIDNAP HIM
BECAUSE HE WAS NOT THERE."

   LEADERS OF THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) HAVE
CONFIRMED THAT GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) HAD PLANNED TO KIDNAP PRESIDENT CRISTIANI "BUT WE DO NOT
KNOW FOR WHAT PURPOSE."

   A RANKING OFFICIAL TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT "WE HAVE AGREED THAT IN THE
EVENT OF A KIDNAPPING THERE WOULD BE NO RESCUE."

   "EVER SINCE WE WERE INSTALLED IN GOVERNMENT WE KNEW THAT WE COULD
END UP ON THE FLOOR (DEAD)," SAID AN OFFICIAL WHO ASKED TO REMAIN
ANONYMOUS.

   DIPLOMATIC CIRCLES ARE ALSO COMMENTING ON REPORTS REGARDING THE
KIDNAPPING OF CRISTIANI AND TOP GOVERNMENT LEADERS.  THEY CONFIRMED TO
ACAN - EFE THAT THE GUERRILLAS WHO ATTACKED CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE WERE
WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.

   SOME SOURCES MAINTAIN THAT THE DISGUISED GUERRILLAS SUBDUED
PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE GUARDS AND ENTERED CRISTIANI'S HOME, BUT
NEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR ANY OF HIS RELATIVES WERE THERE.

   SOURCES CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT ASSURE THAT CRISTIANI, HIS WIFE
MARGARITA, AND OTHER RELATIVES WERE AT A COUNTRYSIDE HOME IN
"COATEPEQUE LAKE," HOWEVER, THIS CLAIM COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED.

   MOST MINISTERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE RESTING AT COUNTRYSIDE
HOMES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, BUT CONGRESS PRESIDENT
RICARDO VALDIVIESO AND VICE PRESIDENT ROBERTO ANGULO WERE IN THEIR
RESPECTIVE HOMES WHEN THE GUERRILLAS ATTACKED AND BOTH OF THEM FOUGHT
BACK WITH THEIR WEAPONS.

   THE FMLN ON 11 NOVEMBER BEGAN A LARGE-SCALE MILITARY OFFENSIVE
WHICH INCLUDED ATTACKS AT MORE THAN 50 POINTS NATIONWIDE, ESPECIALLY
ARMY POSITIONS.  THESE ATTACKS HAVE YIELDED ABOUT 1,000 CASUALTIES
AMONG CIVILIANS, REBELS, AND SOLDIERS.

   SOME SOURCES CLAIM THAT THE RESIDENCE OF JULIO ADOLFO REY PRENDES,
LEADER OF THE AUTHENTIC CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT (MAC), WAS ALSO ATTACKED BY
THE GUERRILLAS, BUT THIS REPORT HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED.

   FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS, ESPECIALLY IN
DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHEAST SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE
REBELS ARE ENTRENCHED, CONTINUES THREE DAYS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE BEGAN.

   COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, ONE OF THE FIVE TOP FMLN LEADERS,
ANNOUNCED THAT 7 OF THE COUNTRY'S 14 DEPARTMENTS WERE DECLARED "FREED
ZONES."

   THE REBELS MAINTAIN THAT THE OFFENSIVE IS DESIGNED TO BRING THE
GOVERNMENT AND FMLN "TO AN EQUAL FOOTING" IN SEEKING A NEGOTIATED
POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR CONFLICT.

   A GUERRILLA WHO WAS INTERVIEWED BY ACAN - EFE IN A SAN SALVADOR
NEIGHBORHOOD SAID THAT "THE OFFENSIVE AIMS TO TOPPLE PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI AND DESTROY THE FASCIST REPRESSIVE PLAN."

   SOME DIPLOMATS MAINTAIN THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMY HAD BEEN
EXPECTING THIS OFFENSIVE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT UNDERESTIMATED IT,
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD BE TWO OR THREE VIOLENT
OUTBREAKS AND NOT A NATIONWIDE LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE SUCH AS THE ONE
THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   "WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW THE GUERRILLAS MANAGED TO REACH
CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE," A SOURCE SAID.  


DEV-MUC3-0743 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI DENIED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE
"LIBERATED TERRITORIES" IN THE COUNTRY, AS WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE
CLANDESTINE "RADIO VENCEREMOS."  HE ALSO DENIED THE REPORT THAT THE
ARMY IS BOMBING CIVILIAN TOWNSHIPS.

   CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED AT A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THERE IS "A TRIANGLE"
CONSISTING OF PANAMANIAN GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA, NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERSATION
FRONT (FMLN) INVOLVED IN THE REBEL OFFENSIVE, BUT SAID HE COULD NOT
SUPPLY ANY MORE DETAILS.

   THE PRESIDENT STATED THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS
CONTROLLED, BUT ADMITTED THAT THERE ARE STILL REBEL "REDOUBTS" IN
DENSELY POPULATED ZONES.

   ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, WHO HELD HIS FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE SINCE
THE OFFENSIVE BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER, THE ARMED FORCES ARE ADVANCING
SLOWLY BUT SURELY "SO AS NOT TO AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) --
[INTERVIEW WITH MERCEDES DEL CARMEN LETONA, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT COMMANDER, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT]
[REPORTER] U.S.  PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HYPOCRITICALLY REGRETTED TODAY
THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS TURNED
THE REGION'S PEACE AGREEMENTS INTO A SENSELESS BLOODBATH WITH THE
OFFENSIVE IT LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER.  WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THIS?

   [LETONA] I WOULD SAY THAT PRESIDENT BUSH'S REMARKS ARE VERY
CYNICAL.  HE SAID THAT A POLITICAL SOLUTION WAS BEING SOUGHT IN
CENTRAL AMERICA AND WITH THIS ACTION, WE HAD BROKEN THE POLITICAL PATH
AND SOUGHT OTHER OPTIONS.  I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO BROKE THE PATH ARE
THE UNITED STATES.  WE MUST RECALL THAT WHILE WE WERE HOLDING TALKS IN
SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA AND DEMANDING THE REMOVAL OF LA TANDONA [NAME
GIVEN TO 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY
ACADEMY] AND DEMANDING JUSTICE AGAINST THE DEATH SQUADS IN
ORDER TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS, THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT APPROVED MORE AID FOR THE FASCIST SECTORS, THE VERY
SECTORS THAT WERE IN FACT REPRESSING THE PEOPLE AND CARRYING OUT SUCH
DRAMATIC AND HORRIBLE ACTIONS AS THE ONE PERPETRATED AGAINST THE
FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION]
BUILDING.  THESE ACTIONS CONTINUE AND HAVE BEEN REPEATED EVERY DAY IN
EL SALVADOR.

   THEREFORE, THE FIRST ONES TO BURY THE POLITICAL POSSIBILITY WERE
THE UNITED STATES.  THE FIRST ONES TO GIVE WEAPONS TO THE FASCISTS TO
CONTINUE KILLING PEOPLE WERE THE UNITED STATES.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
CANNOT WAIT FOR THE FASCISTS TO KILL THEM ALL.  THAT IS NO WAY TO
ATTAIN PEACE, MUCH LESS DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.  THAT IS WHAT THE
UNITED STATES DID.  RIGHT NOW WHEN WE ARE INVOLVED IN AN OFFENSIVE,
WHO ARE THE ONES GUILTY OF GENOCIDE AGAINST THE PEOPLE?  THE UNITED
STATES.  THOSE BOMBS AND THOSE ROCKETS THAT ARE FALLING ON CIVILIANS
ARE BOMBS AND ROCKETS PROVIDED BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMY.

   THE ONES WHO HAVE BLOCKED THE POSSIBILITY OF PEACE AND NEGOTIATION
IN EL SALVADOR ARE THE UNITED STATES.  WE WANTED TO REMOVE LA TANDONA
AND THE GOVERNMENT'S DEATH SQUADS THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS BUT THAT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE.  SO, WE ARE DOING IT THROUGH THE COMBAT OF OUR FORCES AND
WITH THE COOPERATION OF ALL THE PEOPLE.  


DEV-MUC3-0745 (U NEBRASKA)

   MANAGUA, 14 NOV (DPA) -- [TEXT] A LEADER OF THE INSURRECTIONAL
MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR TODAY SAID IN MANAGUA THAT THE MILITARY
CAMPAIGN THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAVE LAUNCHED AGAINST ARMY
TROOPS ON VARIOUS FRONTS AIMS TO CREATE THE APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR
A "GENUINE DIALOGUE" WITH GUARANTEES FOR THE PEOPLE.

   COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT'S (FMLN) POLITICAL COMMISSION, SAID THAT THE REBELS
HAVE ORDERS TO "ADVANCE" AND CONTROL THE "FREED ZONES" AS PART OF ITS
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ARMY OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S "FASCIST GOVERNMENT,
WHICH IS MAINTAINING A SOCIALLY UNJUST REGIME.

   LOPEZ, WHO IS ALSO KNOWN AS "COMMANDER VENANCIO SALVATIERRA," SAID
THAT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HAS USED MORE THAN 15 AIRCRAFTS TO BOMB
CIVILIANS IN SOYAPANGO, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, AND
NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN MIGUEL, CAUSING SERIOUS STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND
KILLING CIVILIANS.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA LEADER POINTED OUT THAT THE FMLN MILITARY
CAMPAIGN, WHICH BEGAN WITH NATIONWIDE ATTACKS ON 11 NOVEMBER, HAS
ENJOYED "POPULAR SUPPORT" WHICH MAKES IT "AN INSURRECTION WHOSE SCOPE
IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE."

   HE ADDED THAT THIS REACTION MEANS THAT THE FMLN "CANNOT ALLOW BLOWS
AGAINST THE PEOPLE TO TAKE PLACE WITH IMPUNITY."

   "WE ARE SEEKING A CHANGE IN THE CORRELATION OF FORCES THAT WOULD
BRING ABOUT APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR A GENUINE DIALOGUE," MARIO
LOPEZ POINTED OUT.  HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI
MUST "QUIT HOPING FOR A MILITARY VICTORY OVER THE FMLN."

   AS FOR EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, LOPEZ SAID THAT EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE BY
VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT THE GENOCIDAL ACTIONS OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMY.  HE SAID THAT THE FMLN IS MAKING SUCH EFFORTS AT THE UNITED
NATIONS AND OAS WHERE NICARAGUA HAS PROPOSED A RESUMPTION OF
NEGOTIATIONS.

   HE ADDED THAT FOR THE TIME BEING, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ARE
ORGANIZING "POPULAR GOVERNMENTS" IN THE "FREED ZONES," HOWEVER, HE
SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE ETABLISHMENT OF A PROVISIONAL FMLN GOVERNMENT.

   LOPEZ SAID THAT AN INTERVENTION BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMY IN THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT, BY SUPPORTING THE CRISTIANI ARMY, "WOULD BE
DANGEROUS FOR CENTRAL AMERICA BECAUSE THE CONFLICT COULD BE SPREADED."
HE RECALLED THAT GUATEMALA IS FACING A GUERRILLA STRUGGLE WHICH IS
OLDER THAN THE ONE IN EL SALVADOR.

   LOPEZ DENIED THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS EXIST BECAUSE OF THE
USSR, CUBA, AND NICARAGUA AND ADDED THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA
STRUGGLE IS OLDER THAN THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT ITSELF (1979).  HE
ADDED THAT THE FMLN HAS DEVELOPED ITS OWN STRATEGIES AND EVEN ITS OWN
WEAPONS, HOWEVER, HE ADMITTED THAT IT RECEIVES WEAPONS FROM ABROAD.
HE PROVIDED NO FUTHER DETAILS ON THE FMLN'S "OWN" WEAPONS.

MINISTER GENERAL HUMBERTO LARIOS DECLARED TODAY THAT BETWEEN 1,000 AND
1,500 FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS HAVE
BEEN FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL SINCE LAST SATURDAY.

   THE DEFENSE MINISTER DENIED THAT THE ARMY IS BOMBING CIVILIAN
AREAS, AS THE GUERRILLAS CHARGED TODAY.

   LARIOS ADMITTED THAT THE REBELS HAVE HIT "FOUR OR FIVE HELICOPTERS"
AND SEVERAL ARMY RADIO PATROL VEHICLES BUT ADDED THAT THEY HAVE NOT
DESTROYED ANY ARMORED VEHICLES.

   THE MILITARY LEADER SAID THAT THE ARMY IS NOT DROPPING HEAVY BOMBS
ON THE TOWNSHIPS IN WHICH GUERRILLAS HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN ORDER TO
"PROTECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI DENIED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE
"LIBERATED TERRITORIES," AS THE FMLN ANNOUNCED TODAY.

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) --
[STATEMENT] [GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] THE ARMY FAILED TODAY IN ITS ATTEMPT TO
RECOVER THE POSITIONS TAKEN OVER BY OUR FORCES ON 11 NOVEMBER IN THE
COUNTRY'S MAIN CITIES.

   THE ENEMY'S COUNTEROFFENSIVE RESULTED IN MORE BLOODSHED AMONG ITS
RANKS.  THE ARMY SOWED TERROR AND DEATH AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION
BY CARRYING OUT INDISCRIMINATE MACHINEGUNNING AND BOMBINGS AGAINST
DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN APOPA, THE HERMITA AND OBRERA
NEIGHBORHOODS, THE CEMETERY AREA, THE SANTA ELENA NEIGHBORHOOD, THE
OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN, LA ESMERALDA NEIGHBORHOOD, LA COQUERA AND EL
GRANILLO IN SAN MIGUEL, THE NORTHERN MAIN HIGHWAY, ZACATECOLUCA,
SOYAPANGO, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND ZACAMIL.

   IN MANY OF THESE PLACES, THE AIR RAIDS LASTED PRACTICALLY ALL DAY,
PRODUCING NUMEROUS CASUALTIES AMONG MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, AND
DESTROYING MANY HOUSES AND OTHER BUILDINGS.

   IN OVERCOMING THE ARMY'S COUNTEROFFENSIVE, WE HAVE MAINTAINED
ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF ALL OUR POSITIONS IN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY.

   WE HAVE INFLICTED THE FOLLOWING CUMULATIVE DAMAGE TO THE ENEMY:
APPROXIMATELY 760 CASUALTIES, 24 ARMORED VEHICLES OUT OF COMBAT, AS
WELL AS 11 HELICOPTERS AND PLANES.

   SUPPORT FOR THE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE HAS BEEN TOTAL IN ALMOST
ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   ONLY 24 HOURS AFTER SUMMONING THE PEOPLE FOR A GENERAL REBELLION,
PEOPLE HAVE MASSIVELY JOINED IN THE TASKS OF COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT
OR HAVE DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN COMBAT.

   THE DECREE DECLARING A 24-HOUR CURFEW IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN
SALVADOR SHOWS THAT WHAT THE ARMY IS FACING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IS
NOT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] BUT
THE PEOPLE'S GROWING REBELLION.

   OUR HEROIC FIGHTERS HAVE RESPONDED WITH THE USUAL VIGOR AND
EFFICIENCY TO THE ORDER GIVEN BY OUR GENERAL COMMAND TO HOLD THE
POSITIONS CONQUERED AND IMMEDIATELY ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE'S GENERAL
UPRISING.

   OUT WITH THE FASCISTS; FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES!

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (LA PRENSA GRAFICA) -- [TEXT] OFFICIALS REPORTED
THAT 220 TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED, 196 WOUNDED, AND 22 CAPTURED DURING THE
CLASHES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE AREA OF THE UNIVERSITY AND ITS OUTSKIRTS.

   AMONG THE WAR MATERIEL CONFISCATED: A SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE, 140
HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES, 6 LAW ROCKET LAUNCHERS, AND MACHINEGUNS.

   AN ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE COPREFA SPOKESMAN STATED THAT THEY
WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO RELEASE ANY OFFICIAL INFORMATION ON THE 11, 12,
AND 13 NOVEMBER EVENTS.

   MILITARY SOURCES WHO WERE QUESTIONED STATED THAT ACCORDING TO
INITIAL REPORTS--REPORTS WHICH ARE UNOFFICIAL AND COVER ONLY UP TO THE
AFTERNOON OF 13 NOVEMBER--RECEIVED FROM SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT AGAINST
THE EXTREMISTS POSITIONED AT THE EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY, THE
TERRORISTS SUFFERED MORE THAN 400 CASUALTIES. THESE CASUALTIES WERE
DISTRIBUTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER: 220 KILLED, 196 WOUNDED, AND 22
CAPTURED.

   THE CONFISCATED WAR MATERIEL INCLUDED A SOVIET-MADE SURFACE-TO- AIR
MISSILE--CONSIDERED THE MOST IMPORTANT CATCH; 140 HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES
INCLUDING 74 AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES, LAW ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 2 M- 79
GRENADE LAUNCHERS, 3 UZI MACHINEGUNS, 50 GRENADES, 2 DRAGUNOV RIFLES
FOR SNIPERS, AND 38 BLASTING CAPS, APPROXIMATELY 1000 M-16 CARTRIDGES;
AND 136 AK-47 CARTRIDGES.

   ALSO CONFISCATED WERE FOUR KNAPSACKS CONTAINING CLOTHING AND
COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA, FIVE TNT BLOCKS, TWO OLIVE-GREEN UNIFORMS, AND

   OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT THE CONFISCATED SOVIET MISSILE WAS PART OF
A 15-MISSILE LOT THAT ENTERED SALVADORAN TERRITORY FROM NICARAGUA AND
THAT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN STORED IN PERQUIN, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.

   THE SOURCE ADDED THAT IT WAS A VERY SOPHISTICATED WEAPON AND THAT
ITS PRESENCE IN SALVADORAN TERRITORY CONFIRMS THAT ONCE AGAIN THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPLIED WEAPONS TO THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]. THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO
SUPPLY WEAPONS DESPITE THE PROMISE MADE BY PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA AT
TELA, HONDURAS THAT HIS REGIME WOULD NO LONGER SUPPLY WEAPONS TO THE
SALVADORAN TERRORIST GROUPS.

ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING, SALVADORAN PEOPLE--IF I MAY
SAY, SO DESPITE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THE CAPITAL CITY. IT IS
REGRETTABLE AND INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SHOULD PERSIST WITH THE AGGRESSION IT HAS
UNLEASHED AGAINST OUR CAPITAL CITY AND SURROUNDING MUNICIPALITIES.
OUR POPULATION HAS SUFFERED THE MOST FROM THIS FMLN AGGRESSION.

   THIS AGGRESSION, SALVADORAN FRIENDS, MUST BE SEEN AS AN ACT OF
DESPERATION BY THE FMLN, AS THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EXPLAIN THEIR
IRRATIONAL ACTIONS. I HAVE USED THE WORD DESPERATION BECAUSE THE FMLN
KNOWS THAT IT IS OUT OF STYLE AND THAT ITS ATTITUDES ARE NO LONGER
ACCEPTED IN THE WORLD. WE CAN SEE IN EUROPE THAT COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED
FROM TOTALITARIAN REGIMES SUCH AS THE ONE THAT THE FMLN WANTS TO
IMPLEMENT HERE, AND WALLS ARE OPEN FOR LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY.

   WE ARE SURE THAT THIS IS WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT: LIBERTY
AND DEMOCRACY. THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE NOT SUPPORTED AND WILL NEVER
SUPPORT THE FMLN TERRORISTS WHO WANT TO SUBJECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
TO TOTALITARIAN REGIMES, TO DICTATORSHIPS OF OPPRESSION, REPRESSION,
AND VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.

   I WAS SAYING THAT THIS IS A DESPERATE ACT BECAUSE WE CANNOT SEE HOW
ANYONE WHO IS NOT DESPERATE COULD CAUSE SO MUCH HARM TO INNOCENT
PEOPLE AND TO THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THERE ARE ALREADY MORE THAN 100
DEAD OR WOUNDED BECAUSE OF THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS. OF COURSE,
TO THAT WE MUST ADD THAT THEY DESTROYED MANY HOMES WHICH THEY ENTERED
AND HAVE HELD FAMILIES AS HOSTAGES. THEY HAVE DAMAGED THE ELECTRICITY,
POTABLE WATER, AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS, DEPRIVING THE POPULATION OF
THOSE ESSENTIAL SERVICES, NOT TO MENTION THE LACK OF FOOD AFFECTING
THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE AREAS WHERE THEY ARE HOLDING HOSTAGES.

   IN ADDITION, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SEE HOW FAR THE FMLN TERRORISTS'
IRRATIONAL MINDS CAN GO, BECAUSE THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT ACTS OF
SAVAGERY THAT WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND. HOW CAN THERE STILL BE ANYONE LIKE
THE NICARAGUANS--AND I AM TALKING ABOUT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, OF
COURSE, NOT ALL NICARAGUANS--AND THE CUBANS, WHO SUPPORT SUCH ACTS OF
SAVAGERY.

   HOLDING CIVILIANS AS HOSTAGES, PUTTING THEM IN THE MIDDLE SO THAT
THEY WILL BE THE ONES WHO ARE HURT, AND SHIELDING THEMSELVES BEHIND
INNOCENT PEOPLE IS AN ACT OF SAVAGERY, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   TAKING OVER A CENTER FOR ORPHAN CHILDREN IN ORDER TO PROTECT
THEMSELVES BEHIND LITTLE CHILDREN WHO DO NOT HAVE A FATHER OR A MOTHER
IS AN ACT OF SAVAGERY, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THEY EVEN DID SOMETHING WORSE AT THE ZACATECOLUCA HOSPITAL AND THE
PEOPLE WITNESSED THIS. WHEN THEY ENTERED THE HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA,
THEY MURDERED, AT GUNPOINT, A SOLDIER WHO WAS RECEIVING MEDICAL
ATTENTION; THEY PLACED BOMBS INSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND THEN FLED.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: THE FMLN IS ALREADY A DESPERATE BEAST. THIS IS
 THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY ABOUT SUCH IRRATIONAL MINDS. HOWEVER, WE
MUST REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND, AND ABOVE ALL, BE SURE THAT THE
MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE REPUDIATE THE FMLN TERRORISTS.                    

   THE PEOPLE MUST KNOW THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON THEIR ARMED FORCES
WHICH HAVE ADVANCED SLOWLY, BUT SURELY. IT IS ADVANCING SLOWLY BECAUSE
IT WANTS TO FULLY PROTECT THE LIVES OF CIVILIANS. THE ARMED FORCES
COULD DRIVE THOSE TERRORISTS OUT OF WHERE THEY ARE; HOWEVER, THERE ARE
CIVILIANS THERE, AND WE WOULD NEVER WANT TO EXPOSE THOSE CIVILIANS TO
THE DANGER THE FMLN IS TRYING TO LEAD THEM INTO.  THE ARMED FORCES
HAVE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE. THEY HAVE EFFECTIVELY ADVANCED, USING
PROFESSIONAL MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE, NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS BOSQUES DEL RIO
ARE TOTALLY CALM NOW, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALREADY ENTERED
AND FORCED THE TERRORISTS OUT. WE KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO
SEE AN END TO THIS TERROR THAT THE FMLN WANTS TO CREATE. HOWEVER, WE
MUST ALSO UNDERSTAND, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT AS
ANGUISHED AT THIS MOMENT AS THOSE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BECOME FMLN
HOSTAGES. THEY TOO, DESERVE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ACHIEVE
OUR OBJECTIVE; HOWEVER, WE MUST DO SO RESPECTING THE LIVES OF THOSE
INNOCENT PEOPLE. THE FMLN FAILED TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE.  [CONTINUED]

   HAVANA (CUBA), 15 NOV 89 (TELE-REBELDE NETWORK) -- [EXCERPTS]
COMMANDER IN CHIEF FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, FIRST SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
OF CUBA AND PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCILS OF STATE AND MINISTERS, LAST NIGHT
GRANTED AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW TO OUR REPORTER, OSCAR SUAREZ, AT THE
INAUGURATION OF THE MADRID RESTAURANT IN HABANA VIEJA. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CASTRO] TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT DAY.  TODAY, WHEN
WE ARE COMMEMORATING THE 470TH ANNIVERSARY OF HAVANA, WE RECEIVED THE
NEWS OF THE CRUSHING TRIUMPH OF THE SOUTH-WEST AFRICAN PEOPLE'S
ORGANIZATION IN THE NAMIBIAN ELECTIONS BY 57 PERCENT. IT IS A VERY
GOOD PERCENTAGE.

   ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO RECEIVED THE NEWS....[REPHRASES] WE
ADMIRE THE HEROISM WITH WHICH THE SALVADORANS ARE FIGHTING.  IT IS
SOMETHING VERY IMPRESSIVE.  IT IS A LIKE A LESSON TO IMPERIALISM WHICH
IS EUPHORIC AND THINKS THAT THE WORLD IS AT ITS FEET. THEY THINK
THAT...

   [SUAREZ, INTERRUPTING] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHICH IS TERRIBLE.

   [CASTRO] I BELIEVE THE ACTIONS THAT THE SALVADORANS ARE PRESENTLY
CARRYING OUT ARE ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FEATS THAT HAVE EVER
BEEN WRITTEN.  DESPITE THE 10 YEARS [OF STRUGGLE], THE
BILLIONS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS INVESTED IN CREATING THE
SALVADORAN ARMY AND SUPPLYING IT WITH THE MOST MODERN TYPES OF ARMS,
NOTICE HOW THOSE PEOPLE CAN FIGHT.  NOTICE WHAT IS BEING DONE.  HOW
ARE THEY USING THE YANKEE BOMBS AND PLANES?  THEY ARE BEING USED TO
MASSACRE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  JUST NOTICE HOW THEY ARE
INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING THE PEOPLE'S NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH ARE IN THE
HANDS OF THE REVOLUTIONARIES.  WHAT THE IMPERIALISTS ARE DOING IS
SOMETHING REPUGNANT.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT WHAT THE SALVADORANS ARE
DOING IS AMAZING, ADMIRABLE.  WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS SHOWING THE
IMPERIALISTS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE FAR FROM KNEELING BEFORE THEM.  THEIR
ACTIONS ARE SHOWING IMPERIALISM THAT THE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING
WITHOUT CARING ABOUT THE EUPHORIA THAT CURRENTLY OVERCOMES THEM UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

   [SUAREZ] COMMANDER, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY ON THE SUBJECT OF WHY WE
HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS?  WE, THE CUBANS ARE WHAT WE ARE BECAUSE WE ARE A
MIXTURE OF SPANISH AND AFRICAN.

   [CASTRO] I THINK WE HAVE THE FRIENDS WE DO BECAUSE WE HAVE FOLLOWED
A POLICY OF PRINCIPLE.  I THINK THE FRIENDS WE HAVE ARE BASICALLY DUE
TO THE PRESTIGE OF THE REVOLUTION, THE RESPECT THE REVOLUTION MERITS,
THE ETHICS OF THE REVOLUTION, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REVOLUTION.
NOW, THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALSO A MIXTURE OF CARIBBEANS, THAT IS
SOMETHING ELSE.  THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS.  [WORD
INDISTINCT] REASONS WE CAN HAVE CONGENIALITY.  HOWEVER, CONGENIALITY
DOES NOT ALWAYS TURN INTO TRUE FRIENDSHIP.  THERE COULD BE
CONGENIALITY BUT IT DOES NOT RESULT IN FRIENDSHIP.  FRIENDSHIP IS MORE
A RESULT OF RECOGNITION, ADMIRATION FOR A COUNTRY.

   [SUREZ] DO YOU BELIEVE THAT...

   [CASTRO] THIS SMALL COUNTRY WAS FACING THE EMPIRE, IT BECAME A
BASTION OF DIGNITY FOR THE WORLD.  I THINK THIS MERITS CERTAIN
RECOGNITION AND LIKING. WE CAN BE PROUD OF THAT AND OF THE FRIENDS WE
HAVE.  I APPRECIATE THESE FRIENDS WHO ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE
YANKEE PRESSURES.  THEY ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE YANKEE THREATS,
INTRIGUES, AND CAMPAIGNS.  THIS SAYS A LOT.  THE YANKEES WANTED TO
BURY AND DISCREDIT THE REVOLUTION WITH THE MEDIA AGENCIES THEY OWN.
HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT.  THAT IS WHY UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FRIENDSHIP AND SOLIDARITY
THAT OTHER NATIONS RENDER US.  ASIDE, FROM THAT, WE ARE CARIBBEANS.
WE ARE A GOOD MIXTURE.  WE ARE A MIXTURE OF WHICH WE ARE PROUD.  WE
ARE A MIXTURE OF INDIAN, AFRICAN, AND EUROPEAN.  THAT MIXTURE HAS
TURNED OUT TO BE VERY GOOD.

   [SUAREZ] WE ALSO HAVE CHINESE MIXTURE IN US.

   [CASTRO] THAT IS TRUE, YOU ARE CORRECT IN REMINDING US OF IT.  I
THINK THIS MIXTURE HAS ALSO HELPED TO ENRICH THE VIRTUES OF OUR
NATION. [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] [END RECORDING]

   THE POLICE ALSO REPORTED THAT TWO BOMBS EXPLODED LAST NIGHT AND
DESTROYED TWO TELEPHONE JUNCTION BOXES IN SEPARATE LOCATIONS IN THE

GREAT ALARM AND PROMPTED SEVERAL POLICE PATROL CARS TO COMB THE AREAS
IN SEARCH OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, THE SOURCE ADDED.

   A SQUAD DEFUSED A HIGH - POWER BOMB THAT HAD BEEN PLANTED IN FRONT
OF THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY.

   NO VICTIMS AT THE SITE OF THE EXPLOSIONS WERE REPORTED. THE DAMAGE
ON THE JUNCTION BOXES, HOWEVER, WILL PROBABLY BE COSTLY TO THE STATE
TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION.

   THESE ATTACKS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ONE SUSTAINED BY THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE OPPOSITION RIGHTIST NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT

TODAY ATTACKED BY LAND AND AIR THE GUERRILLAS WHO EARLY THIS MORNING
OCCUPIED CIUDAD MERLIOT, A MIDDLE-CLASS RESIDENTIAL AREA IN
SOUTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR.

   AN "A-37" SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANE FLEW OVER THE AREA AND STRAFED
CERTAIN POINTS, WHILE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS WENT THROUGH THE
STREETS AND INFANTRY SOLDIERS CONFRONTED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS.

   THE REBELS, WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING SINCE 11 NOVEMBER IN THE CAPITAL
CITY, TOOK POSITIONS IN CIUDAD MERLIOT VERY EARLY THIS MORNING AND
BURNED BUSES AND TRUCKS, AND THEN PLACED THE CHARRED VEHICLES AS
BARRICADES ON THE MAIN ENTRANCES TO THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS.

   THE GUERRILLAS ALSO CUT OFF ACCESS TO THE MAIN HIGHWAY JOINING SAN
SALVADOR TO SANTA ANA, THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT CITY IN THE COUNTRY,
AND LA LIBERTAD PORT.

   AT LEAST FIVE ARMY ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS WERE CONTINUOUSLY
FIRING ON THE GUERRILLA POSITIONS IN CIUDAD MERLIOT.

   "GET AWAY.  THIS IS A PROHIBITED AREA.  THERE IS HEAVY SHOOTING
AGAINST THE GUERRILLAS," SHOUTED A SOLDIER FROM ONE OF THE ARMORED
PERSONNEL CARRIERS TO AN ACAN-EFE CORRESPONDENT WHO WAS MOMENTARILY
TRAPPED ON ONE OF THE MAIN STREETS OF THE RESIDENTIAL AREA.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ON 11 NOVEMBER BEGAN THE GREATEST

   A REPORT SENT BY COMRADES COMMANDER CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO AND
CARLOS ARGUETA INDICATE THAT THE ENEMY ATTEMPT TO TAKE OUR POSITIONS
IN ZACAMIL FAILED.

   AT 0400 TODAY, AN IMPORTANT BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN ZACAMIL.  COMBINED
TROOPS OF THE BELLOSO AND BRACAMONTE BATTALIONS, AND A CAVALRY UNIT,
WITH THE SUPPORT OF ONE HELICOPTER AND ONE OR TWO LIGHT PLANES, TRIED
TO ATTACK OUR FORTIFIED POSITIONS.  HOWEVER, THIS ATTEMPT ENDED IN A
RESOUNDING FAILURE.  THE ENEMY SUSTAINED 45 CASUALTIES IN THE ATTACK,
WHICH LASTED FROM 0400 UNTIL 1100.  THESE CASUALTIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN
CONFIRMED, INCLUDED A SECTION CHIEF.  IN ADDITION, OUR FORCES
DESTROYED ONE ARMORED VEHICLE AND DAMAGED ANOTHER. WE ALSO HAVE A
BELLOSO BATTALION PATROL TRAPPED IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS.  SOME
MEMBERS OF THIS PATROL WERE WOUNDED, OTHERS WERE KILLED IN ACTION.

   IN ITS DESPERATION, THE ARMY HAS USED THE AIR FORCE FOR ITS
INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS.

   THIS IS A LAST-MINUTE REPORT WE HAVE FROM SAN SALVADOR: THE ENEMY
COUNTERATTACK FAILED IN ZACAMIL.  BY NOON, OUR FORCES HAD HAD
CONTROLLED THIS ATTACK.  THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR IS BECOMING

FOREIGN MINISTER JOSE MANUEL PACAS CASTRO TODAY CONDEMNED THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN IN HIS COUNTRY, AND HE
BLAMED THE ULTRALEFTIST GROUPS FOR IT, ALTHOUGH HE SAID HE HAD NO
PROOF.

   "IT IS A REPUGNANT CRIME," SAID THE FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO WAS
ATTENDING THE 19TH OAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND HE DESCRIBED THE
ASSASSINATIONS AS A "DESPERATE ACTION TAKEN BY THE LEFT."

   JOAO BAENA SOARES, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE OAS, WAS ASKED TODAY TO
REPORT TO THE ASSEMBLY ON THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IN COMPLIANCE
WITH THE RESOLUTION ON THAT COUNTRY THAT WAS APPROVED ON TUESDAY.

   A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY BY A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SPOKESMAN IN WASHINGTON BLAMED THE SALVADORAN
ARMY FOR THE CRIME, AND ADDED THAT "ALL OF THE BODIES HAD BULLET
WOUNDS IN THE HEAD, INDICATING THAT THEY WERE EXECUTED."

   PACAS CASTRO SAID TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, HEADED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WILL MAINTAIN ITS COMMITMENT TO A DIALOGUE TO
DISCUSS THE SUSPENSION OF THE HOSTILITIES AND TO IMPLEMENT AN INTERNAL
PEACE PROCESS.

   MOREOVER, HE ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL MISSION, CAPABLE OF MAKING
DECISIONS AND COMMITMENTS, WILL TRAVEL TO CARACAS IN THE HOPE OF
MEETING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FMLN GUERRILLAS.

   THE SALVADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THE SITUATION IN HIS COUNTRY
IS UNDER CONTROL AND THAT ARMY TROOPS ARE SLOWLY MOVING INTO THE
DENSELY POPULATED AREAS TO AVOID BLOODSHED AMONG THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.

   AS FOR A REQUEST BY THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO CALL FOR A
CEASE-FIRE FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS TO TREAT THE WOUNDED AND CIVILIAN
VICTIMS, PACAS CASTRO SAID THAT THE FIRST-AID BRIGADES CONTINUE TO DO
THEIR WORK IN EL SALVADOR.

   AS FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THE TWO WOMEN, HE
SAID "HE CONDEMNED THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE" BECAUSE IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
ONE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WAS KILLED, "WAS MY TEACHER," AND HE
DESCRIBED THE PRIEST AS A VERY VALUABLE MAN WHO WORKED FOR PEACE AND
FOR THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE POPULATION.

   COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO MADRIGAL NIETO, IN STATEMENTS
TO THE PRESS, REGRETTED THE DEATH OF THE CLERGYMEN.  "WORKING FOR
PEACE IS VERY DIFFICULT," HE SAID.

   MADRIGAL NIETO SAID TODAY HE HOPED THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS WOULD CONTINUE DESPITE THE WAR.

   GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER ARIEL RIVERA IRIAS SUPPORTED THE
STATEMENTS OF HIS COSTA RICAN COLLEAGUE, AND HE CONDEMNED THE USE OF
VIOLENCE AS A POLITICAL TOOL.

AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY:

   1.  IT WAS LEARNED THROUGH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SOURCES THAT THERE
WERE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN U.S. PENTAGON ADVISERS AND THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES' GENERAL STAFF ON THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF SALVADORAN AIR
FORCE PILOTS.

   2. AS A RESULT OF THESE ASSESSMENTS, ON 13 NOVEMBER, U.S. COMBAT
PILOTS ARRIVED AT THE ILOPANGO AIR FORCE BASE FROM HONDURAS.

   3.  IN THE PAST 48 HOURS, THESE U.S. PILOTS HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT
THE BOMBING MISSIONS IN SAN SALVADOR.  NIGHT BOMBINGS ARE CARRIED OUT
EXCLUSIVELY BY THESE YANKEE PILOTS, AND THEY ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE INFLICTED AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   4. ON 15 NOVEMBER, [WORD INDISTINCT] COMPANY TROOPS FROM GUATEMALA
ARRIVED IN OUR COUNTRY AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE BY THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION TO GET REGIONAL ARMIES TO INTERVENE IN THE SALVADORAN
WAR.

   THE FMLN BELIEVES THAT THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS DEVELOPMENTS THAT
COULD LEAD TO THE EXPANSION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT TO THE REST OF
THE REGION.  WE CALL ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, PARTICULARLY,
ON THE U.S. PUBLIC TO DENOUNCE BEFORE THE WORLD THE ESCALATION OF THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S MEDDLING IN EL SALVADOR.  WE WARN THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ABOUT THE DANGER OF THIS ESCALATION AND THAT
WE WILL NOT BE THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF NORTH AMERICANS
IN OUR FATHERLAND.  WE CALL ON CENTRAL AMERICA'S PRESIDENTS TO BECOME
AWARE THAT THIS U.S. INTERVENTION HARMS THE ESQUIPULAS AND TELA
ACCORDS AND CONSTITUTES A DIRECT ATTACK ON THE REGION'S PROCESS OF
DEMOCRATIZATION AND PEACE.

[COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] IN VIEW OF THE SINISTER MASSACRE OF
JESUIT PRIESTS TODAY, THE FMLN REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE:

   1.  THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IGNACIO ELLACURIA, SEGUNDO
MONTES, IGNACIO MARTIN BARO, JOAQUIN LOPEZ, AMANDO LOPEZ, AND JUAN
RAMON MORENO, ALONG WITH MRS JULIA ELBA RAMOS AND HER DAUGHTER CELINA
RAMOS, WAS PERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES DEATH SQUADS AT DAWN TODAY.

   A GROUP OF ABOUT 30 MEN DRESSED IN GREEN STORMED INTO THE PRIESTS'
RESIDENCE AND RIDDLED THEM WITH BULLETS FIRED FROM HEAVY CALIBER
WEAPONS.  THREE OF THE BODIES WERE DRAGGED OUT TO THE PATIO WHERE THEY
WERE GIVEN DEATH BLOWS THAT COMPLETELY CRUSHED THEIR SKULLS.

   2.  THIS ABSURD MASSACRE AND THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS AGAINST HEAVILY
POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES' HIGH COMMAND, AND ARE PART OF
A COUNTERINSURGENT PLAN TO DESTROY THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND CREATE
A STATE OF TERROR AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  PUBLIC DEATH THREATS
WERE MADE AGAINST PRIEST IGNACIO ELLACURIA OVER THE ARMED FORCES
NATIONAL NETWORK.

   THE NIGHT OF WEDNESDAY, 15 NOVEMBER, THE SECURITY CORPS SEARCHED
THE OFFICES OF THE OPPOSITION GROUPS LOOKING FOR THE LEADERS IN ORDER
TO KILL THEM.  THIS IS THE SAME SCHEME THEY USED IN 1979 AND 1980 WHEN
THEY MURDERED MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND MASSACRED THE REVOLUTIONARY
DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, UNIVERSITY RECTOR DR FELIX ULLOA, AND TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.

   3.  THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT THE ARENA [NATIONALIST
REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] REGIME AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE
FASCIST BEASTS THAT HAVE BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO PROTEST SUCH AN
UNFORTUNATE MASSACRE, AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ISOLATE
THE FASCIST REGIME OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   4.  WE CALL ON THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS WHO KNEW FATHER IGNACIO
ELLACURIA -- AND RESPECTED HIM FOR HIS PAST HISTORY IN THE FIELDS OF
EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE TRUE SITUATION --
TO TAKE A DIGNIFIED AND DETERMINED STAND AND NOT STAIN THEIR HANDS
WITH THE BLOOD OF GENOCIDE.

   THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST PATRIOTS IN THE ARMED FORCES WHO DO
NOT HAVE TO SINK WITH THE CRIMINALS.  WE OFFER THEM OUR HANDS, SO THAT
TOGETHER WE WILL SAVE THE COUNTRY, AND SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE
PART OF THE ARMED FORCES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES
ASSASSINATED THE JESUIT PRIESTS, BUT THEY ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE.

   5.  THE FMLN CONDEMNS THIS CRIME AND JOINS IN THE SORROW OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO LOSE IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER SOME OF THE MOST
APPRECIATED INTELLECTUALS OF OUR COUNTRY.  THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND
SENSIBILITY WERE ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS IN OUR
SOCIETY.  THEIR WORK WILL BE ETERNAL, AND THE FASCIST IRRATIONALITY
WILL NEVER PUT AN END TO THAT WORK.

   WE CALL ALL OF OUR COMMANDS, FIGHTERS, MILITANTS, AND OUR PEOPLE IN

DEV-MUC3-0763 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS AND THE CONSTANT AIR FORCE BOMBINGS
OF POPULATED AREAS CONTINUED FOR THE 6TH CONSECUTIVE DAY TODAY, WHILE
THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS FLED FROM THE MAIN AREAS OF FIGHTING.

   IN SAN SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY IN NORTHWESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS, EFE
REPORTERS WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THE PERSISTENT CLASHES AND CONTINUOUS
LAUNCHING OF ROCKETS BY AIR FORCE PUSH AND PULL AIRCRAFT AGAINST THE
REBEL POSITIONS IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS.

   AT LEAST TWO BLOCKS OF HOMES IN LOW-INCOME ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD
HAVE BEEN ABLAZE SINCE MID-MORNING AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE
LAUNCHED ON SATURDAY, WHICH HAS LEFT MORE THAN 600 DEAD AND 1,000
WOUNDED.

   THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF ZACAMIL, MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND
CUSCATANCINGO ARE THE PRINCIPAL AREAS OF FIGHTING IN THE SALVADORAN
CAPITAL WHERE, ACCORDING TO ARMY SOURCES, THE MILITARY HAVE "LAID
SIEGE TO THE REBELS AND WILL EVICT THEM IN A FEW HOURS."

   THE SALVADORAN ARMY, SUPPORTED BY AIRCRAFT AND ARTILLERY, ARE
ATTACKING THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE APPROXIMATELY 300,000 PERSONS LIVE
AND WHERE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE TAKEN UP POSITIONS.

   FOR THEIR PART, SPOKESMEN FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN), ENTRENCHED IN BUILDINGS AND BEHIND BARRICADES
IN DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS CLAIM THAT THEY "WILL NOT RETREAT"
AND THAT "THEY HAVE CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITIONS IN THE CAPITAL AND
OTHER CITIES OF THE COUNTRY."

   ACCORDING TO THE FMLN, FIGHTING IS UNDER WAY IN AT LEAST 7 OF THE
24 DEPARTMENTS OF EL SALVADOR, WHILE THE FIERCEST CLASHES ARE TAKING
PLACE IN USULUTAN, LA PAZ, SAN MIGUEL, AND MORAZAN IN THE EASTERN PART
OF THE COUNTRY.

   INDEPENDENT CIVILIAN SOURCES REPORTED THAT IN THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN
DEPARTMENT OF SAN MIGUEL THE GUERRILLAS HAVE OCCUPIED POSITIONS IN
VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS, WHICH ARE UNDER HEAVY AIR AND ARTILLERY FIRE.

   HOWEVER, THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT CLAIM THAT THE SITUATION IS
UNDER CONTROL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND THAT "THERE ARE GUERRILLA
REDOUBTS" IN SAN SALVADOR ONLY.

   MEANWHILE, THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE CLASHES
ARE TAKING PLACE ARE SEEN RUNNING TERRIFIED THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAN
SALVADOR SEEKING PLACES OF REFUGE.

   THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE -- MEN AND WOMEN WITH CHILDREN IN THEIR ARMS --
CAN BE SEEN CARRYING A FEW BELONGINGS AND HOLDING WHITE FLAGS AS THEY
WALK TO SHELTERS OPENED BY VARIOUS CHURCHES, WHERE THEY RECEIVE FOOD
AND MEDICINE.

   THE PRECARIOUS SITUATION OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS "IS VERY
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES.

   THE EXODUS OF SALVADORANS HAS GROWN EVEN MORE IN VIEW OF THE STRICT
SECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, SUCH AS THE
STATE OF SIEGE AND THE 24-HOUR CURFEW ENFORCED IN THE DEPARTMENTS
WHERE CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE AND 12 HOURS IN THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY.

   SO FAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF
CASUALTIES AS A RESULT OF CLASHES AND THE BOMBINGS THAT TOOK PLACE
LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING.

   THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENTER THE
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE DUE TO THE HEAVY
FIGHTING, AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REJECTED A PROPOSAL FOR A TEMPORARY
TRUCE TO EVACUATE THE WOUNDED AND PERMIT THE BURIAL OF BODIES STILL
LAYING IN THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR.  


DEV-MUC3-0764 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION.  PAY
CLOSE ATTENTION.  ZACAMIL, CUSCATANCINGO, AND SOYOPANGO RESIDENTS: IT IS
RECOMMENDED THAT YOU LEAVE YOUR HOMES IMMEDIATELY TO KEEP THE FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS FROM USING THEM AS PLACES WHERE
THEY CAN SHIELD THEMSELVES FROM THE VICTORIOUS ADVANCES OF OUR ARMED FORCES.

   THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS OFFERED THE FOLLOWING PLACES TO BE USED AS
REFUGE: BUEN SAMARITANO SCHOOL IS READY TO ACCEPT SANTA MARTA
RESIDENTS, AND SAN ROQUE PARRISH, WE CORRECT OURSELVES, IT IS THE
JESUS OBRERO PAROCHIAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO OPEN.  REFUGE CAN ALSO BE TAKEN
AT THESE FOLLOWING SCHOOLS: SAN JOSE BOARDING SCHOOL, SAGRADO CORAZON,
AND LA ASUNCION.

   THIS URGENT CALL IS MADE PRIMARILY FOR FAMILIES WHOSE HOUSES ARE
CLOSE TO THE LAST TERRORIST POCKETS LOCATED IN THE PLACES MENTIONED.
WE DO ALL THIS FOR THE SAFETY OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.  WE ASK YOU TO
COME OUT WITH WHITE FLAGS AND YOUR HANDS UP HIGH.  TOGETHER --
GOVERNMENT, PEOPLE, AND THE ARMED FORCES -- WE ADVANCE TOWARD PEACE.


DEV-MUC3-0765 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COMMANDER FACUNDO
GUARDADO, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN
THE PAST DECADE, TODAY SAID THAT THE ARMY'S COUNTEROFFENSIVE IN SAN
SALVADOR "IS AT A STALEMATE," WHILE THE "REBELS ARE ADVANCING."

   GUARDADO, WEARING AN OLIVE GREEN UNIFORM, TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE
GUERRILLAS' OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER, SURPRISED THE ARMED
FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS "MOTIVATED WARMONGERING
SECTORS IN THIS COUNTRY TO CONTINUE REPRESSION."

   THE GUERRILLA LEADER, KNOWN AS "ESTEBAN," SAID: "WE ARE WILLING TO
NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR FROM
HERE [SAN SALVADOR], WHILE WE CONTINUE TO HOLD THESE TERRITORIES (IN
SAN SALVADOR)."  HE ADDED: "WE WOULD HAVE TO ASK ARMY CHIEFS IF THESE
ARE THE SO-CALLED UNDELIMITED BORDER AREAS BORDERING HONDURAS."

   THE SALVADORAN ARMY HAS REPEATEDLY CHARGED THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) WITH SEEKING REFUGE IN "UNDELIMITED
BORDER AREAS" IN DISPUTE WITH HONDURAS.

   GUARDADO WAS INTERVIEWED NEAR A CLINIC IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.
HE WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO COMPLAINED TO THE PRESS OF THE
SALVADORAN AIR FORCE'S "INDISCRIMINATE" BOMBINGS.

   "WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE OUR HOMES.  WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO
DO.  WE ASK YOU (THE PRESS) TO REPORT THAT THE AIR FORCE IS BOMBING
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS," A MAN WHO WAS CARRYING A WHITE FLAG AND SAYING
GOOD-BYE TO HIS NEIGHBORS SAID.

   THE GUERRILLAS PRESENTED TO THE PRESS TWO SOLDIERS WHO WERE
DETAINED ON 15 NOVEMBER AS SOLDIERS TRIED TO EXPEL REBELS FROM
MEJICANOS, A DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE
SOLDIERS, APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS OLD, IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS JOSE
FRANCISCO RAMIREZ AND SANTOS LOPEZ.  "WE WERE CAPTURED YESTERDAY.  WE
WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVE BEEN FED.  WE DO NOT CONSIDER OURSELVES
PRISONERS OF WAR," RAMIREZ SAID.  LOPEZ SAID HE HAD ENTERED THE
MEJICANOS AREA WITH 45 OTHER SOLDIERS, BUT "ALL OF THEM LEFT."


DEV-MUC3-0766 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] WHEN ANSWERING A
QUESTION ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO OTHER PERSONS
COULD HAVE BEEN MURDERED BY THE MILITARY, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT "IF THE ARMED FORCES PEOPLE DID IT, THE
WEIGHT OF THE LAW WILL FALL ALSO ON THEM."

   CRISTIANI "STRONGLY CONDEMNED" THE MULTIPLE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE
EARLY THIS MORNING AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO "GROUPS OR MINDS THAT WANT TO
HINDER THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN
EL SALVADOR."

   THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS DETERMINED "TO INVESTIGATE THIS TO THE
VERY END, REGARDLESS OF WHO DID IT."

   HE EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS TOO EARLY "TO GIVE ANY OPINION" ON WHO
COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE MURDERS, POINTING OUT THAT THE FACT THE MEN
WHO DID IT WERE WEARING UNIFORMS AND WERE MOVING AT NIGHT DURING THE
STRICT CURFEW IN THE CITY "IS NOT CONCLUSIVE."

   CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THE ARMED FORCES AS WELL AS THE GUERRILLA
GROUPS MOVE DURING THE CURFEW HOURS."

   HE STATED THAT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF,
WITH WHOM HE MET THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE, HE HAS ORDERED AN
INVESTIGATION.

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT DISCLOSED THE EXISTENCE OF "A POSSIBLE
WITNESS THAT HAS NOT BEEN INTERROGATED BY THOSE WHO ARE CARRYING OUT
THE INVESTIGATION" AND WHO HAVE FINGERPRINTS AND EMPTY CARTRIDGES OF
BULLETS FOR AK-47S AND M-16S.

   CRISTIANI DISAVOWED VERSIONS REPORTED DURING THE DAY BY THE
GOVERNMENT RADIO NETWORK THAT CLAIM THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS COMMITTED THE MURDER.

   IN ANOTHER PART OF HIS NEWS CONFERENCE, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ADMITTED THAT WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES "THERE MIGHT GROUPS OF PERSONS
WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT," BUT HE ADDED THAT "AS AN
INSTITUTION, THEY ARE WITH THE GOVERNMENT."


DEV-MUC3-0767 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI STATED TODAY HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO CONTINUE
THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS, BUT ONLY IF IT DESISTS FROM VIOLENCE
AND JOINS THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   "WE WILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO ANY GAME WITH THE GUERRILLAS.  WHILE
SPEAKING OF PEACE, THEY PREPARED THIS ACTION" (THE OFFENSIVE),
CRISTIANI STATED, NOTING THAT THE REBELS "ARE GOING TO ANY LENGTH TO
TRY TO ACHIEVE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS."

   "IF HOSTILITIES DO NOT CEASE ON THE PART OF THE GUERRILLAS, THERE
WILL NOT BE ANY DIALOGUE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LEND ITSELF TO THIS
GAME," HE INSISTED.

   THE PRESIDENT STATED AT A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THE ARMY "HAS
CONTROLLED" NATIONAL TERRITORY, ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT IN SOME
PLACES, ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL, CLASHES ARE STILL
TAKING PLACE WITH THE REBELS.

   CRISTIANI STATED THAT COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS "IS VERY
DISTURBED AND TERMED THE REBELS CYNICAL," BECAUSE WHILE THEY SPOKE OF
PEACE THEY WERE PREPARING THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON SATURDAY.

   THE PRESIDENT AGAIN DENIED THAT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE IS
INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  HE SAID THAT ONLY
TWICE HAVE BOMBS BEEN USED, THE FIRST TIME IN AN OPEN FIELD OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF EL SALVADOR WHERE MORTARS WERE POSITIONED, AND AGAIN
LAST NIGHT IN THE VICINITY OUTSIDE THE AIR FORCE GARRISONS.

   CRISTIANI STATED THAT THE GUERRILLAS USED BOMBS LAST NIGHT AGAINST
THE AIR FORCE IN EASTERN SAN SALVADOR AND WERE REPELLED BY AIRCRAFT
WHICH DROPPED BOMBS.

   THE PRESIDENT STRESSED THAT THE ARMY HAS NOT EVICTED THE GUERRILLAS
FROM POSITIONS IN THE NORTHWESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN SALVADOR SO AS
"NOT TO AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   HE ADDED THAT FRANCE AND GUATEMALA HAVE OFFERED TO DONATE MEDICINE
FOR THE THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHO HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AS
A RESULT OF THE INTENSE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS SINCE
THE OFFENSIVE BEGAN, CAUSING APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DEATHS.


DEV-MUC3-0768 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CRISTIANI] FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.  BRIEFLY,
BEFORE BEGINNING THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY
BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS THAT WE CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST TERMS
THE MURDERS OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEIR COOK, AND HER DAUGHTER EARLY
THIS MORNING AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, UCA.  WE FEEL THAT
THESE INCIDENTS FURTHER COMPLICATE OUR COUNTRY'S CRITICAL SITUATION.
GROUPS OR MINDS WANT TO HAMPER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE
PEACE PROCESS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS TRIED TO ADVANCE
AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE.

   FROM THE START WE ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT
NOW THAT THE PEOPLE AND ALL OF THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS HAVE
SUPPORTED THE PEACE PROCESS, IT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE
HAVING THESE SAVAGE INCIDENTS TAKE PLACE THAT ARE AIMED AT BLOCKING
THIS PROCESS.  WE HAVE MADE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS THAT MERELY
TELL US HOW THINGS HAPPENED.  WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SOME PROCEDURAL
STEPS, SUCH AS [WORD INDISTINCT] WHERE THE IMPACT WAS FELT AND WHERE
THE CRIMES WERE PERPETRATED.  IN SUM, WE DID THE THINGS NORMALLY DONE
AT THE START OF THESE KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS.

   THERE IS A POSSIBLE WITNESS TO THESE CRIMES, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, HE
HAS NOT BEEN LOCATED SO THAT HE CAN BE QUESTIONED BY THE
INVESTIGATORS.  THEY WILL CERTAINLY MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO LOCATE HIM SO
THAT HE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT WILL CLARIFY THIS REGRETTABLE
INCIDENT.

   I SUPPOSE THE JESUITS' PROVINCIAL WILL HOST A NEWS CONFERENCE.  YOU
HAVE MANY OF THE DETAILS, SO WE ARE GOING TO SKIP THEM.  THE ONLY
THINGS WE HAVE FOUND ARE FINGERPRINTS THAT ARE BEING STUDIED AND SHELL
CASINGS FROM AK-47 AND M-16 RIFLES.  WE WILL SUBMIT THEM FOR BALLISTIC
TESTS.  WE WILL ALSO CONDUCT FORENSIC TESTS, WHICH WILL BEGIN SOON.
ANOTHER IMPORTANT DETAIL IS THAT INSIDE THE BUILDING THERE WAS A ROOM
OR LIBRARY WITH VIDEO CASSETTES.  IT WAS LIKE A STUDIO.  THIS ROOM
LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN BURNED AFTER BEING RANSACKED.  ALL THESE
THINGS AND OTHER DETAILS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND SUBMITTED TO THE
INVESTIGATORS.  WE ALSO TALKED TO THE JESUITS' PROVINCIAL AND TOLD HIM
THAT WE WERE DETERMINED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.  WE ASKED HIM
FOR HIS HELP, AND HE EXPRESSED HIS READINESS TO ASSIST IN THE
INVESTIGATION.  WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THIS HELP BECAUSE IN THE PAST
COOPERATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN FORTHCOMING.

   WE HOPE THAT WITH THIS HELP AND WITH THE REMARKS BY MSGR ARTURO
RIVERA Y DAMAS, WITH WHOM WE ALSO SPOKE THIS MORNING, THIS CASE WILL
NOT BE POLITICIZED AND JUSTICE CAN BE SERVED, AVOIDING REACHING HASTY
OR BIASED CONCLUSIONS BY ANY OF GROUP OR PARTY.  WE THINK AND AGREE
WITH MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS THAT THIS IS HOW A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION
SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.  WE HOPE THAT THIS INVESTIGATION WILL LEAD US TO
THE HEART OF THE MATTER.  REGARDLESS OF WHO THE PERPETRATORS ARE, WE
WANT PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE ATTEMPTING TO HINDER THE PROCESS OF PEACE
AND DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.

   AND SO WE BEGIN THE QUESTIONS.  PERHAPS MR SANDOVAL OR ANA MARIA
MAY WANTO HELP US TO PUT SOME ORDER [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] FIRST, THE GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE REPEATS ECO [MEXICAN
NEWS AGENCY] ECO REPORTS, WHICH MENTION UNKNOWN TERRORISTS.
REGARDLESS OF THE SIDE THAT IS INVOLVED, THIS IS THE WAY TO DESCRIBE
THESE ACTIONS.  THESE ARE TERRORIST ACTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR OVERALL
CONTEXT, NO MATTER WHO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  LET ME REPEAT: WE HAVE
COMMENTS BY CHURCH OFFICIALS WHO WERE GIVING VERSIONS THAT HAVE NOT
BEEN CORROBORATED.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE WERE SEVERAL PERSONS
WEARING UNIFORMS, TO CITE THESE VERSIONS VERBATIM.  I DO NOT WANT TO
EXCUSE OR ACCUSE ANYONE, BUT I FEEL THAT IS NOT A CATEGORICAL PROOF.
TODAY, MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELONG TO THE ARMED FORCES ARE WEARING
UNIFORMS.

   LET ME REPEAT: ONE CANNOT SAY ONE THING OR ANOTHER, BUT I DO THINK
THIS MUST BE INVESTIGATED.  IF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES ARE FOUND
TO BE INVOLVED, THEY WILL FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE LAW.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0769 (U NEBRASKA)

   PARIS (FRANCE), 16 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX MEMBERS OF HIS ORDER, INCLUDING IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UCA), "ARE THE SAME ONES WHO
KILLED MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR."

   "I DO NOT WANT TO ACCUSE ANYONE, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS WHERE THE FACTS ARE
POINTING," JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA [JESUIT PROVINCIAL SUPERVISOR] STATED AT A
NEWS CONFERENCE HELD THIS AFTERNOON IN THE UCA CHAPEL, ONLY A FEW METERS
FROM WHERE THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTICS WERE KILLED THIS MORNING.

   THE BODIES OF ELLACURIA AND HIS JESUIT COMPANIONS IGNACIO MARTIN
BARO, SEGUNDO MONTES, JUAN RAMON MORENO, ARMANDO LOPEZ, AND JOAQUIN
LOPEZ, AS WELL AS DOMESTIC ELBA RAMOS AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
WERE RIDDLED WITH BULLETS, WHILE SOME ALSO HAD THEIR SKILLS CRUSHED.

   THE DEATH OF THE PRIESTS, FIVE OF THEM SPANIARDS, WHO WERE ALWAYS
IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, HAS INCREASED THE
FEAR AND DESPERATION FELT BY THE SALVADORANS SINCE THE PAST WEEKEND,
WHEN VIOLENT FIGHTING BROKE OUT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND SOLDIERS IN
THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE PRIESTS WERE KILLED BY SOME 30 MEN WEARING OLIVE DRAB UNIFORMS
WHO BROKE INTO THE PLACE, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES WHO WERE THERE,
TOJEIRA EXPLAINED.

   THE PRIEST RECALLED THAT OVER THE WEEKEND THE GOVERNMENT RADIO
NETWORK "LAUNCHED FIERCE ATTACKS AGAINST THE [WORD INDISTINCT], SAYING
THAT A FEW PRIESTS HAD TO BE KILLED IN THIS COUNTRY OR THAT THEY HAD
TO BE PLACED IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL SO THAT THE PEOPLE COULD KILL
THEM BY SPITTING AT THEM," TOJERA NOTED.

   ALSO, HE ADDED THAT ON MONDAY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS RAIDED THE HOMES
OF ELLACURIA AND COMPANIONS.  "ON THAT OCCASION THEY WERE QUITE
CORRECT, ACCORDING TO WHAT FATHER ELLACURIA TOLD ME," ADDED TOJEIRA,
WHO WAS QUITE UPSET DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE.

   "APPARENTLY THE MEN SAID THEY HAD REPORTS THAT THERE WERE WEAPONS
IN THE RESIDENCES.  OF COURSE THEY FOUND NOTHING, AND FATHER ELLACURIA
INVITED THEM TO RETURN ON TUESDAY AND GO THROUGH THE UCA CAMPUS, BUT
THEY DID NOT DO SO."

   ALSO, TOJEIRA CONFIRMED THAT ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING
THERE WAS TIGHT SECURITY IN THE VICINITY OF THE UCA IN THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE CAPITAL.

   "I DO NOT KNOW IF THE SOLDIERS LEFT THE PLACE LATER, BUT UP UNTIL
2200 ON WEDNESDAY, HOURS BEFORE THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE, THE SOLDIERS
WERE THERE," TOJEIRA ADDED.

   "THESE ARE THE FACTS.  THEREFORE, WE SHARE THE OPINION OF
ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA -- THAT THE ONES RESPONSIBLE ARE THE SAME
ONES WHO ASSASSINATED MSGR ROMERO," HE ADDED.  


DEV-MUC3-0770 (U NEBRASKA)

   GUATEMALA CITY, 9 NOV 89 (PRENSA LIBRE) -- [TEXT] IN AN ANALYSIS OF THE
VIOLENCE DURING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, THE INFORMATION OFFICE OF THE
BUSINESS SECTOR (OFISEM) POINTS OUT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO
PROVIDE AN ATMOSPHERE OF SECURITY FOR THE PEOPLE SO THAT THE ECONOMY CAN
MOVE IN A MANNER FAVORABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE STATISTICS ON THE SEPTEMBER VIOLENCE -- TAKEN FROM THE MEDIA --
SHOW THERE IS A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN SOME ASPECTS, BUT THE PREVAILING
SITUATION IS OF GREAT CONCERN, THE BUSINESSMEN ADD.

   IN A COMPARISON OF THE STATISTICS FOR AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, IT IS
NOTED THAT 142 MURDERS WERE REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER WHILE 126 WERE
REPORTED IN AUGUST.  OFISEM ALSO REPORTS THAT 17 KIDNAP CASES WERE
REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER, AGAINST 19 CASES IN AUGUST.  AS FOR MISSING
PERSONS, THERE WERE 12 REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER AND 19 IN AUGUST.

   THE REPORT ADDS THERE WERE 26 CASES OF ASSAULT IN SEPTEMBER,
AGAINST 71 CASES IN AUGUST, WHILE THERE WERE 41 CRIMINAL ATTACKS IN
SEPTEMBER AND 57 IN AUGUST.  CONCERNING ACTIONS BY SUBVERSIVE GROUPS,
OFISEM ADDS ONE SUCH ACTION WAS REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER, AND 12 IN
AUGUST.  FIVE CASES OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING WERE REPORTED IN AUGUST,
AND ONLY ONE IN SEPTEMBER.

   OFICEM ONCE AGAIN URGES THE AUTHORITIES TO INCREASE THEIR
ACTIVITIES TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE GUATEMALANS, WHO DESERVE TO
LIVE IN PEACE IN AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IS CONDUCIVE FOR THE PROGRESS OF
GUATEMALA.

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [REPORT] [COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] [TEXT]
SALVADORAN PEOPLE: AFTER 5 DAYS OF COMBAT, CONFRONTING THIS ARMED
AGGRESSION BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
TERRORISTS, [WORDS INDISTINCT] I WANT TO INFORM YOU OF THE SITUATION
THROUGHOUT THE NATION:

   IN THE WESTERN AREA, THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS.  IN THE EASTERN AREA,
THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS.  IN SAN MIGUEL CITY, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE
COMMAND HAS BEEN OPERATING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER, AND IT HAS
AVOIDED HARMING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION; THEREFORE, THERE ARE
TERRORISTS IN THE [NAMES INDISTINCT] NEIGHBORHOODS.  ALSO IN USULUTAN
LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING, [WORDS INDISTINCT] BUT AT PRESENT
ONLY SOME EXPLOSIONS AND SOME SPORADIC FIRING ARE HEARD IN THE
VICINITY OF THE CITY OF USULUTAN.  IN ZACATECOLUCA YESTERDAY WE
MANAGED TO CONTROL THE POPULATION COMPLETELY.  WE DISLODGED THE
TERRORISTS FROM THE 27 SEPTEMBER NEIGHBORHOOD.

   WE HAVE HAD SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THE FMLN HAS
WAGED ITS GREATEST EFFORTS HERE. THEY ARE [WORD INDISTINCT]
TERRORISTS, AND THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUCH.  IN SOME
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTHERN AREA, THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] MEJICANOS,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] AS OF SUNDAY, 12 NOVEMBER. IN SOME [WORDS
INDISTINCT] AS IT WAS YESTERDAY.  ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] OF THE CAPITAL CITY.  IN MEJICANOS, IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] NORTH OF THE GUADALUPE AND SOYAPANGO NEIGHBORHOODS,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] REPARTO SANTA MARTA, AND ALTOS DEL [WORD
INDISTINCT]. IN THIS AREA, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CARRIED OUT ACTIONS
TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO NEUTRALIZE THIS GENOCIDE [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL, I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE SOME PARTIAL
RESULTS. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SUSTAINED THE FOLLOWING: 177 DEAD AND
251 WOUNDED.

   AMONG THE TERRORISTS THERE ARE 655 DEAD AND 491 WOUNDED.  WE HAVE
CAPTURED 92 FMLN MEMBERS, AND 6 FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE TURNED THEMSELVES
IN.  AS FOR THE CIVILIANS, WE REGRET 47 PERSONS HAVE DIED, AND 153
HAVE BEEN WOUNDED.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SEIZED FROM THE FMLN TERRORISTS 324 RIFLES,
75 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 26 MORTARS, 8 MACHINEGUNS, 15
SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND 40 WEAPONS OF OTHER TYPES.  FOUR ARSENALS HAVE
ALSO [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN MEJICANOS, WHERE THE TERRORISTS HAD A
CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: YOU MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ARMED FORCES
AND IN YOUR GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING JOINTLY. OUR COMMANDER
IN CHIEF IS UP TO DATE ON THE SITUATION, AND [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND
WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER. THE ARMED FORCES IS WORKING IN A VERY
PROFESSIONAL MANNER. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE CANNOT RESOLVE THIS
SITUATION BY ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY IT
TAKES LONGER FOR THE ARMED FORCES TO DO THINGS.

   ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, WE WANT TO THANK YOU, OUR PEOPLE,
FOR YOUR SUPPORT, AS YOU HAVE BEEN PROVIDING US WITH PLENTY OF
INFORMATION, SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS IN THE VARIOUS COMBAT AREAS, AND--
MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL--CONDEMNING AND REJECTING THIS TERRORIST
ATTACK. THAT IS THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] OF THE FMLN.

   WE ARE ALL WORKING, STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, TO
MAINTAIN FREEDOM [WORD INDISTINCT], AND ACHIEVE PEACE. I ALSO WANT TO
INFORM YOU THAT AFTER VISITING THIS AFTERNOON THE VARIOUS AREAS WHERE
WE ARE [WORD INDISTINCT], THE MORALE OF OUR TROOPS AND OFFICERS IS
VERY HIGH. AND THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING
TO DEFEND YOU.

   [WORD INDISTINCT] THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE A VERY LOW MORALE,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] MANY, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW AWARE OF THEIR
CASUALTIES AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   I WANT TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ON BEHALF OF THE
ARMED FORCES, TO STRONGLY CONDEMN THOSE WHO THIS MORNING MASSACRED SIX
JESUIT PRIESTS. WE REGRET AS WELL THE DEATHS OF OTHER CIVILIANS,
INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CONFLICT. WE ALSO
REGRET THE DEATHS AMONG OUR ARMED FORCES.

   IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE,
AND THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL COMMAND ARE PROUD OF THE PROFESSIONAL
WORK BEING DONE AT THE VARIOUS GARRISONS OF OUR ARMED FORCES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, WE ASK FOR YOUR
SUPPORT. YOU MUST CONTINUE GOING TO WORK AND CONTINUE WORKING.  IN
CONCLUSION, I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE ONCE AGAIN FOR THEIR MORAL AND
MATERIAL SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES AT SUCH A
DIFFICULT TIME.  


DEV-MUC3-0772 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [REPORT] [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] SIX DAYS AFTER HAVING
INITIATED OUR OFFENSIVE IN THE CAPITAL CITY AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY,
THERE HAS BEEN AN OVERWHELMING TREND TOWARD THE CONSOLIDATION AND
BROADENING OF FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
POSITIONS IN IMPORTANT CITIES AND TOWNS IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH HAVE
PLAYED LEADING ROLES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE SUPPORTED AND JOINED THE
STRUGGLE.

   TODAY WE COMPLETED AN ARCH OF FREEDOM IN SAN SALVADOR BY EXTENDING
AND CONNECTING SEVERAL AREAS UNDER OUR CONTROL, AFTER REPELLING AND
SWAMPING THE GOVERNMENT'S SPECIAL BATTALIONS IN FIVE COUNTERATTACKS
SUPPORTED BY ARMORED VEHICLES AND AERIAL BOMBINGS.

   OUR FIGHTERS DISPLAYED SINGULAR HEROISM DURING THE OCCUPATION OF
THE CUSCATANCINGO HEADQUARTERS AND THE COMMANDS IN MEJICANOS AND
CIUDAD DELGADO, WHERE WE CAPTURED A LARGE ARSENAL OF WEAPONS AND
AMMUNITION, AND DURING CLASHES IN [NAME INDISTINCT], SOYAPANGO, CIUDAD
MERLIOT, AND [NAME INDISTINCT].

   THE FMLN ALSO HAS FORCES ALONG THE LEADING ROUTES TO THE CAPITAL CITY;
THESE FORCES HARASS AND HINDER ARMY DEPLOYMENTS ON THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY,
AND ON THE SAN SALVADOR-SANTA TECLA HIGHWAY.

   WE NOW HIGHLIGHT OUR FORCES' FEATS: COMPANIES FORMED BY POPULAR
FORCES HAVE EXTENDED THEIR CONTROL OVER NEW AREAS AND CITIES IN SAN
MIGUEL AND USULUTAN, WHERE WEAPONS HAVE BEEN SEIZED AND PRISONERS OF
WAR TAKEN.  WE STRESS OUR PERMANENT HARASSMENT OF ENEMY FORCES IN
ZACATECOLUCA, CHALATENANGO, SANTA ANA, APOPA, SAN MARTIN, SAN MARCOS,
NUEVA CONCEPCION, SANTA ELENA, AND OTHER TOWNS.

   TRANSPORTATION HAS BEEN PARALYZED SINCE THE FMLN DECLARED A
STOPPAGE, AND MOST OF THE COUNTRY IS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY DUE TO
SABOTAGE.  THE CRITICAL DEADLINE THE HIGH COMMAND SET FOR ITSELF TO
RECOVER OUR POSITIONS HAS PASSED, AND OUR FORCES HAVE ASSAULTED
HEADQUARTERS IN CONTROLLED AREAS AND HAVE REQUISITIONED WEAPONS AND
AMMUNITION.

   HUNDREDS OF YOUTHS CONTINUE TO JOIN OUR ARMY.  WITHOUT POPULAR
SUPPORT THE FMLN WOULD NOT HAVE ACHIEVED POLITICAL-MILITARY VICTORIES
OF SUCH DIMENSIONS AS TO TAKE THE ENEMY BY SURPRISE AND EARN THE
WORLD'S ADMIRATION.

   IN THE PAST 2 DAYS THE FMLN HAS INFLICTED DOZENS OF CASUALTIES
AMONG THE ARMY'S OFFICERS AND TROOPS, AND IT HAS TAKEN FIVE PRISONERS
OF WAR, AMONG WHOM ARE A CAPTAIN AND A LIEUTENANT, WHOSE PHYSICAL AND
MENTAL WELL BEING HAS BEEN RESPECTED.  THE FMLN HAS SEIZED 63 RIFLES,
4 MACHINEGUNS, 3 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, 5 PRC-77 RADIOS, [WORDS
INDISTINCT], AND THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION FROM THE OCCUPIED
HEADQUARTERS AND COMMANDS.

   WE CALL ON ALL THE PEOPLE TO JOIN THE UPRISING [WORD INDISTINCT]
AGAINST THE FASCIST GENOCIDE.  WE ASK THE OFFICERS AND TROOPS NOT TO
CONTINUE SERVING IN AN ARMY THAT IS BEHAVING LIKE A FOREIGN OCCUPATION
ARMY, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, EXECUTING PRIESTS,
AND MASSACRING LABOR LEADERS.

   IN THE CITIES AND COUNTRYSIDE, A SEA OF GUERRILLAS [BREAK IN
RECEPTION PREVENTS COMPLETION OF ITEM].

UNLEASHED AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN SAN SALVADOR.

   WE REMIND YOU THAT A FEW WEEKS AGO COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES
AND COLONEL INOCENTE ORLANDO MONTANO LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE
LUTHERAN AND OTHER CHURCHES THROUGHOUT EL SALVADOR.  NOW THIS
CAMPAIGN, ORCHESTRATED BY COL ELENA FUENTES, CHIEF OF THE 1ST INFANTRY
BRIGADE'S DEATH SQUADS, HAS HEIGHTENED.  NOT ONLY HAVE JESUIT PRIESTS
BEEN MURDERED, BUT THIS MORNING THE NATIONAL GUARD ARRESTED TWO
PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S.  CITIZEN.  WE
REPEAT: TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES HAVE BEEN ARRESTED
INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN.  THESE PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED BY THE NATIONAL
GUARD.  WE CALL ON ALL THE [WORD INDISTINCT] AROUND THE WORLD; WE CALL
ON ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SECTORS TO MOBILIZE.  TWO PRIESTS
AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES WERE ARRESTED THIS MORNING BY THE NATIONAL
GUARD IN SAN SALVADOR.  AMONG THE ARRESTED PERSONS IS A U.S.  CITIZEN.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS IS IN CONTACT WITH SAN SALVADOR TO GATHER MORE
DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE TWO PRIESTS AND
SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN, WHO WERE ARRESTED.

   THE PERSECUTION AGAINST THE CHURCH CONTINUES BY ARENA [NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] AND THE LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966
GRADUATES OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY]
MILITARY CLIQUE.  RADIO VENCEREMOS CALLS ON ALL THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD, THE
LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNITY, TO MOBILIZE, OCCUPY SALVADORAN EMBASSIES,
DEMONSTRATE IN FRONT OF SALVADORAN EMBASSIES AROUND THE WORLD AND
DEMAND THE RELEASE OF THE PRIESTS WHO WERE ARRESTED THIS MORNING BY
THE NATIONAL GUARD.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] 1 MINUTE FOR THE RELIGIOUS
COMMUNITY AROUND THE WORLD TO SPEAK OUT AND MOBILIZE TO PRESSURE
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. THIS COULD SAVE THE LIVES OF THE PERSONS ARRESTED
THIS MORNING BY THE NATIONAL GUARD, A BLOODTHIRSTY GUARD THAT IS
RELIVING THE LAST DAYS OF THE SOMOZIST GUARD.  THE KILLING OF PRIESTS
AND NOW THE ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES FURTHER
CONFIRMS THAT THE REGIME IS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSING, THAT IT IS
DESPERATE AND NO LONGER CARES ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,
PRESSURE, OR REQUESTS FOR AN END TO THE BOMBINGS AND BLOODSHED.  THIS
MORNING'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN THE ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL
MISSIONARIES.

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [STATEMENT] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] ACTIONS SUCH AS
THESE, ACCOMPANIED BY ORCHESTRATED SLANDEROUS CAMPAIGNS, SCARE AWAY
INVESTMENTS FROM OUR COUNTRY AND THE HUMANITARIAN AID THAT WE NEED SO
MUCH.  DR CUSTODIO, THE SAME AS NORIEGA, CONTINUES TO DECEIVE THE
PEOPLE AND EXPLOIT THEM TO FURTHER PERSONAL INTERESTS AND
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM.  AS A BUREAUCRAT, (ALTHOUGH HE TRIES TO COVER
THIS UP), CUSTODIO OWNS MANY MATERIAL GOODS AND FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS,
AND AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH, HE IS FUELING THE BONFIRE OF VIOLENCE
IN OUR COUNTRY ONLY TO RUN AWAY WHEN THE FIRE GIVES WAY TO CHAOS AND
ANARCHY AMONG THE PEOPLE.  HE WILL LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITH HIS
INTERNATIONAL CONTACTS AND FEEL SATISFIED FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE.

PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA [SUBHEAD]

   CODEH HAS DONE NOTHING FOR PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  QUITE THE
CONTRARY, IT HAS DISCREDITED DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES AND SUPPORTED THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT OF DANIEL ORTEGA, WHO IS NOW DOING ALL HE CAN TO
BOYCOTT FREE ELECTIONS TO WHICH THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO,
AND TO MURDER THOSE WHO LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS AND ARE RETURNING TO THE
COUNTRY IN SEARCH OF PEACE, DEMOCRACY, AND LIBERTY.

   CODEH HAS DONE NOTHING TO PROMOTE PEACE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN
RIGHTS, BECAUSE IT IS SUPPORTING AND PROMOTING THE RECRUITMENT,
TRAINING, AND ACTIONS OF GUERRILLA GROUPS, WHICH ARE DESTABILIZING AND
SOWING VIOLENCE AMONG DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES.

   THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR.  CODEH BELIEVES THAT THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT IS
THE BEST ONE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE FSLN [SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT], WITH CUBA'S SUPPORT, IS CHANNELLING ARMS TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF EL SALVADOR TO MURDER INNOCENT SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.  ALL THIS IS TAKING PLACE WITH THE APPROVAL OF DR CUSTODIO AND HIS
FINANCING SOURCES, WHICH REALIZE THAT THEIR STRATEGIC, IDEOLOGICAL,
ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL GOALS ARE COMING TRUE.  

CONCLUSION [SUBHEAD]

   IN CONCLUSION: WHAT CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE EXPECT FROM DR CUSTODIO
AND CODEH WHEN THEY WOULD RATHER DESTROY HONDURAS AND ITS PEOPLE TO
INGRATIATE THEMSELVES WITH THE COMMUNISTS?

   WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS "LEADER" WHO IS CONSTANTLY
DENOUNCING CONDEMNATIONS AND ATTACKS AND DEFINES HIMSELF AS A
PERSECUTED PERSON, AND WHO MANIPULATES PUBLIC OPINION TO GAIN
NOTORIETY WHILE CREATING FEAR AND TERROR AMONG THE HONDURAN PEOPLE?

   WHAT FUTURE CAN HONDURAS EXPECT WHEN THE ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS
DEFENDER SPECIALIZES IN DISCREDITING THE HONDURAN PEOPLE ABROAD?

   WHAT CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE EXPECT WHEN CODEH COLLABORATES WITH
AND SUPPORTS THE ARMING OF THE SANDINISTS, SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS, AND
DICTATOR NORIEGA?

   DR CUSTODIO IS NOT BEING PERSECUTED FOR POLITICAL REASONS, HE IS NO
HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER, AND HE HAS NOT BEEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH.  HE IS
SIMPLY A MAN WHO HAS CHOSEN THE WRONG PATH.  WHILE COMMUNISM BEHIND
THE IRON CURTAIN, WHICH IS OVER 70 YEARS OLD, IS EMBRACING DEMOCRACY
AS A WAY OF LIFE (HUNGARY, POLAND), HE INTENDS TO REPLACE DEMOCRACY
FOR COMMUNISM AND LIBERTY FOR SLAVERY IN HONDURAS.

   DR CUSTODIO HAS SIMPLY MADE A MISTAKE AND HE STAYS ON HIS PATH
THROUGH DECEIT AND LIES.

   DOWN WITH THE HONDURAN MARXIST-LENINIST TRAITORS!

   STOP INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM!

   STOP THE MANIPULATION OF THE HONDURAN PEOPLE!

   DEMOCRATS WILL NOT ALLOW THE ENSLAVEMENT AND MURDER OF THE PEOPLES!

   LET US STOP THOSE WHO MANIPULATE HUMAN RIGHTS OF OUR HONDURAS.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE RECENTLY HEARD
U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ON A SALVADORAN TELEVISION NEWSCAST.  HE SAID
NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHO HAD PLANNED THE MURDER OF FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA
AND THE OTHER JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WERE ASSASSINATED EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS TELLS WILLIAM WALKER THAT HIS CYNICISM IS BEYOND
THE LIMIT.  WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHICH GENERAL STAFF
OFFICE ISSUED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

   WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS THAT ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER RADIO
CUSCATLAN URGED THE PEOPLE TO ASSASSINATE IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RUBEN
ZAMORA, AND DOCTOR GUILLERMO UNGO.  THE WHOLE WORLD.... [CORRECTS
HIMSELF] THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA HAS FEATURED THE RECORDING IN WHICH
RADIO CUSCATLAN -- THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF'S RADIO, MEANING THE
RADIO CONTROLLED BY THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, THE RADIO IN WHICH
NOT A SINGLE WORD, NOT A SINGLE COMMA GOES OUT WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF
THE CENSORS WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON RADIO CUSCATLAN - - [WORDS
INDISTINCT] DEATH.

   THEREFORE, WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHERE THE ORDER CAME
FROM; HE KNOWS THE EXACT TIME THAT 40 UNIFORMED MEN LEFT IN [WORDS
INDISTINCT] CURFEW, A FEW BLOCKS FROM COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE'S
OFFICE.  WILLIAM WALKER'S CYNICISM WENT BEYOND THE LIMIT WHEN HE SAID
THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW [WORDS INDISTINCT] OR WHO PLANNED IGNACIO
ELLACURIA'S ASSASSINATION.

   WILLIAM WALKER IS DOING A HISTORICAL IMITATION OF THE FILIBUSTER
WHO CAME TO CENTRAL AMERICA IN 1856 TO SUBJUGATE OUR PEOPLE AND BECOME
PRESIDENT OF A CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION, MEANING NICARAGUA, WHO DECREED
THAT ENGLISH BE THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, AND THAT THE U.S.  FLAG BECOME
THE OCCUPATION FORCES' FLAG.  WILIAM WALKER IS RE- EDITING A SHAMEFUL
CHAPTER IN CENTRAL AMERICA'S HISTORY.  WILLIAM WALKER, THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR IN OUR HOMELAND, IS RE-EDITING -- IN THE FORM OF A
CARICATURE -- A HISTORICAL EVENT WHICH OCCURRED IN THE 19TH CENTURY.
HOWEVER, WE WANT TO TELL SOMETHING TO THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO HAS
BEEN FEATURED IN PRESS AND TELEVISION NEWS REPORTS GIVING FIGURES
WHICH DIFFER EVEN FROM THOSE GIVEN BY COL PONCE; THE NEW WILLIAM
WALKER, WHO THINKS HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND IS BETTER THAN
CRISTIANI AND COL PONCE, SO HE GIVES INVENTED FIGURES ON GUERRILLA
CASUALTIES; THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO EVALUATES THE NATION'S
POLITICAL AND MILITARY SITUATION, EVEN BEFORE CRISTIANI AND PONCE DO
SO, EVEN CONTRADICTING COL PONCE'S FIGURES.  WILLIAM WALKER SAID 40
MEMBERS OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WERE
CAPTURED, YET THE BLEARY-EYED COL PONCE LAST NIGHT TALKED ABOUT 9 FMLN
MEMBERS.  WHERE, THEN, ARE THE REST OF THE CAPTURED FMLN FIGHTERS?

   HUMANITARIAN GROUPS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THAT CONTRADICTION
BETWEEN PRESIDENT WILLIAM WALKER AND HIS SUBORDINATE, COL PONCE.  RED
CROSS INTERNATIONAL, GREEN CROSS, AND AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL MUST
DEMAND THAT WILLIAM WALKER SAY WHERE THE CAPTURED GUERRILLA FIGHTERS
ARE, BECAUSE COL PONCE ONLY MENTIONS NINE FIGHTERS.  COL PONCE TALKS
ABOUT NINE AND THE OTHER ONE TALKS ABOUT DOZENS.  THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN
PRESIDENT WILLIAM WALKER AND HIS SUBORDINATE, COL PONCE.  WHERE ARE
THE OTHER CAPTURED FIGHTERS?  MOST OF THEM WERE SURELY CIVILIANS WHO
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CONFLICT.  THEY MUST HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN
THE WAR ZONES AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE MEDIA AS DEAD GUERRILLA
FIGHTERS.

   WE DEMAND, BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THAT AMBASSADOR
WILLIAM WALKER CLEARLY SAY HOW COL PONCE COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN WHEN
ADMITTING THAT ONLY NINE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS WERE CAPTURED -- WHILE THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR PERSONALLY REVEALED THE FIGURES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
REVEALED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI A LONG TIME AGO -- EVEN IF THEY WERE
IMAGINARY FIGURES.  WILLIAM WALKER MUST ANSWER THIS QUESTION: WHERE
ARE THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS?

BARCO VARGAS WILL PAY AN OFFICIAL WORKING VISIT TO JAPAN FROM DECEMBER 5-8,
A FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN SAID THURSDAY.

   BARCO WILL BE THE FIRST COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT JAPAN.

   GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES ARE FORMULATING AN ECONOMIC AID PROGRAM FOR

   JAPAN EXTENDED A TOTAL OF 6.69 MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC AID TO
COLOMBIA LAST YEAR.

   THE COLOMBIAN LEADER IS SCHEDULED TO MEET EMPEROR AKIHITO, PRIME
MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU AND FOREIGN MINISTER TARO NAKAYAMA.

   THE SOURCES ALSO SAID JAPANESE POLICE WILL PROVIDE TIGHT SECURITY
FOR BARCO AGAINST POSSIBLE TERRORIST ATTACK DURING HIS FOUR-DAY STAY
HERE.

   BARCO HAS BEEN WAGING AN ALL-OUT WAR WITH THE DRUG CARTELS SINCE HE

   HAVANA (CUBA), 17 NOV 89 (RADIO REBELDE NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[ORLANDO CONTRERAS] [TEXT] FIGHTING CONTINUES TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR,
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE TRIUMPHALIST TONE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY
BEGINS TO CHANGE.  AN AP CABLE WE RECEIVED THIS MORNING IN OUR
NEWSROOM SAYS THE FOLLOWING: THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THEY
HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN VARIOUS SUBURBS OF THIS CAPITAL.  THIS IS
WHAT THE AP CABLE SAYS TEXTUALLY IN ITS HEADLINE.

   IN ADDITION TO THIS SITUATION, THERE IS ANOTHER FACT IN THE
BATTLEFIELD TO WHICH THE NEWS AGENCIES HAVE NOT PAID MUCH ATTENTION,
WHICH IS ALSO A REFLECTION OF THE TYPE OF COMBAT THAT THE SALVADORAN
FORCES ARE FIGHTING.  AP ITSELF SAYS THE FOLLOWING: THE WAR BECAME
DIRTY WITH THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN BY
UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS WHO ACTED DURING THE CURFEW.  FURTHERMORE, THE
CABLE SAYS THAT THE CANADIAN EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR REPORTED THAT 12
WORKERS FROM THE LUTHERAN CHURCH WERE ARRESTED BY UNIFORMED SECURITY
INDIVIDUALS IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR.  AT THE BEGINNING, THE CABLE
SAID THAT THE SIX PRIESTS HAD BEEN MURDERED BY UNIDENTIFIED
TERRORISTS.  LATER, THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AS UNIFORMED INDIVIDUALS.

   AMONG THE PRIESTS MURDERED WAS FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY AND DIRECTOR OF A MAGAZINE WHICH
REFLECTED THE PEOPLES' THOUGHTS, NOT ONLY IN EL SALVADOR BUT ALSO IN
THE REST OF CENTRAL AMERICA.  NONE OF THESE PRIESTS BELONGED TO THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  FURTHERMORE,
ELLACURIA HIMSELF ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS EXPRESSED OPINIONS WHICH DID
NOT CONCUR WITH THOSE OF THE FMLN.  HOWEVER, HE FELT THAT A SOLUTION
TO THE SALVADORAN PROBLEM COULD NOT EXCLUDE THE PEOPLE'S INCLUSION OF
THE FMLN.  THE ASSASSINS WHO ACTED UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE CURFEW
ARE FROM THE SALVADORAN ARMY, THEY ARE NOT UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS,
LIKE THE AP CABLE SAYS.  THEY ARE ASSASSINS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY,
THE SAME ARMY WHICH HAS ALL THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.  IN
THIS, WE CAN ALSO SEE THE DOUBLE STANDARD OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
ON THE ONE HAND, ALL ITS PUBLICITY APPARATUS SAYS TO THE WORLD THAT
WASHINGTON IS IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRACY AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE, IT SUPPORTS THE ASSASSINS OF PRIESTS AND
SUPPLIES BOMBS AND ROCKETS SO THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY -- WHICH HAS
PLANES AND HELICOPTERS PROVIDED BY THE UNITED STATES -- CAN BOMB THE
SALVADORAN CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   THESE ARE THE FACTS.  THIS IS THE TRUTH THAT YANKEE PROPAGANDA IS
HIDING AND MANIPULATING.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] THIS MORNING, AND
WITH A STUPID LOOK ON HIS FACE, U.S.  AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ASKED WHO
HAD KILLED FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA.  HE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD DONE
THIS.  WELL THEN, MR WILLIAM WALKER, AND MONITORS AT THE U.S. EMBASSY, GOOD
MORNING; RADIO VENCEREMOS GREETS YOU.  WE ARE ASKING YOU TO TAKE DOWN WHAT
WE ARE GOING TO SAY AND TAKE IT IMMEDIATELY TO WILLIAM WALKER'S OFFICE.

   GOOD MORNING U.S. EMBASSY MONITORS, TELL WILLIAM WALTER -- WE DO
NOT KNOW IF HE IS FROM TENNESSEE LIKE THE OTHER FILIBUSTER -- THAT
RADIO VENCEREMOS IS GIVING HIM A CLUE SO THAT HE CAN FIND OUT WHO
KILLED FATHER ELLACURIA.  TELL WILLIAM WALKLER TO FIND OUT WHO
ARRESTED TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S.
CITIZEN THIS MORNING.

   AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, THIS MORNING YOU ASKED WHO HAD MURDERED
FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA; RADIO VENCEREMOS WILL GIVE YOU A CLUE.  FIND
OUT WHO ORDERED THIS MORNING'S ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS.  U.S.
AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF YOU HAVE A DROP OF DECENCY LEFT IN YOU,
SPEAK UP, SAY WHAT YOU KNOW.  TELL US WHERE THE 40 MEN IN UNIFORM LEFT
FROM.  U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER FROM TENNESSEE, THAT IS, IF YOU
ARE FROM TENNESSEE LIKE THE OTHER FILIBUSTER -- RADIO VENCEREMOS IS
GIVING YOU A CLUE SO THAT YOU WILL FIND AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION YOU
CANDIDLY ASKED ON TELEVISION THIS MORNING.  YOU SAID THAT YOU DID NOT
KNOW WHO HAD ORDERED THE DEATH OF ONE OF THE MOST INTELLIGENT MEN IN
EL SALVADOR, NOT BORN IN EL SALVADOR BUT MORE SALVADORAN THAN COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE.

   WE REPEAT, MR AMBASSADOR TO EL SALVADOR, THE FOLLOWING IS OUR CLUE:
FIND OUT WHO ORDERED THE ARREST OF THE PRIESTS AND MISSIONARIES,
INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN.  FIND OUT IMMEDIATELY, AND YOU BETTER MOVE
QUICKLY, OTHERWISE THEY COULD BE KILLED.  THERE LIES YOUR ANSWER.  ASK
WHETHER THE TWO PRIESTS WERE ARRESTED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] OR THE ARMED FORCES.  WE INSIST, IF
THERE IS A SINGLE DROP OF DECENCY LEFT IN YOU, CHECK THE ELENA FUENTES
STATEMENTS AGAINST THE CHURCH MONITORED A FEW DAYS AGO.

   MR AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF THERE IS A SINGLE DROP OF DECENCY
LEFT IN YOU, CHECK THE RECORDINGS THE U.S. EMBASSY HAS OF RADIO
CUSCATLAN AND LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS, AND MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ ON THE NIGHT OF 11
NOVEMBER AND EARLIER.

   GENTLEMEN AT THE U.S. EMBASSY WHO ARE MONITORING US, HELP THE
AMBASSADOR.  GO TO YOUR FILES, FIND THE RADIO CUSCATLAN RECORDINGS AND
TAKE THEM TO THE AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE.  MONITORS AT THE EMBASSY, HELP
THAT ABSENTMINDED AMBASSADOR.  MONITORS AT THE EMBASSY, GIVE HIM A
HAND; IT SEEM THAT THE AMBASSADOR'S MEMORY IS FAILING HIM.  MONITORS,
YOU WHO ARE SO EFFICIENT, WE ASK YOU TO HELP THE AMBASSADOR REGAIN HIS
MEMORY.  TAKE HIM COL ELENA FUENTE'S RECORDING ACCUSING THE CHURCH OF
HAVING TIES WITH THE FMLN.  TAKE HIM COL MONTANO'S STATEMENTS, TAKE
HIM COL ZEPEDA'S STATEMENTS, TAKE HIM ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON'S
STATEMENTS, ACCUSING FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA OF BEING THE DIRECTOR OF
THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR.  HELP US U.S. EMBASSY MONITORS BECAUSE IT
SEEMS THAT MR WILLIAM WALKER HAS A VERY SHORT MEMORY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO REPORTS
RECEIVED IN THIS NATIONAL RADIO-TELEVISION NETWORK, BRITISH NEWSMAN DAVID
BLUNDY OF THE SUNDAY TIMES [AS HEARD] BECAME A VICTIM OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, BULLETS.  HE DIED A FEW MINUTES AGO AT
ROSALES HOSPITAL. THE FMLN TERRORISTS DO NOT SATISFY THEIR INSTINCTS BY
KILLING CIVILIANS AND THE UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] JESUITS, NOW
THEY ARE AIMING THEIR CRIMINAL MACHINEGUNS AT JOURNALISTS.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE, TOGETHER WITH THE
GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES, REPEAT THEIR CALL TO THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY TO REPUDIATE THE FMLN ASSASSINS.

   THE CIVILIANS WHO GAVE BLUNDY FIRST AID HAVE TOLD US THAT THE
NEWSMAN WAS HIT BY AN FMLN SNIPER WHEN HE WAS GREETING AN OFFICER OF
OUR GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES IN MEJICANOS.

   THIS ACTION ONCE MORE CONFIRMS THE TREACHEROUS AND FLAGRANT HUMAN
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OF THE FMLN ASSASSINS, WHO ARE BEING REPUDIATED BY
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) -- [REPORT]
[TEXT] [REPORTER] COMRADE VILLALOBOS [MEMBER OF THE GENERAL COMMAND OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] REFERRED TO THE
BOMBINGS AND THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  THIS IS THE QUESTION
HE WAS ASKED: IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS AND
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PRESSURED THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE
BOMBINGS AND THE BLOODSHED IN OUR HOMELAND.  HOWEVER, DESPITE THIS
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE KILLED IN SAN
SALVADOR.  THEREFORE, WHAT IS THE INTENTION BEHIND THE BOMBINGS?  WHAT
INTENTION DID THE ARMED FORCES' GENERAL STAFF HAVE IN KILLING THE
JESUITS?  COMMANDER VILLALOBOS REPLIED:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VILLALOBOS] FIRST, IT MUST BE SAID THAT THE
KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WAS A HARSH
BLOW TO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR AN EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.
THE JESUIT PRIESTS ARE A SECTOR OF SALVADORAN SOCIETY THAT HAS MADE
AND CONTINUES TO MAKE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PEOPLE'S EDUCATION.
THEY TAUGHT US HOW TO DEBATE, THE NEED TO REASON THINGS OUT, AND THE
NEED TO HAVE POLITICAL PLURALISM.

   HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE [WORD
INDISTINCT] SECTORS, AND MR. CRISTIANI CANNOT STAND INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE, THE DEBATES, THE ANALYSES, AND THE PEOPLE'S REASONING.  THIS
IS WHY THEY COMMITTED THIS CRIME.

   THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME BECOMES EVIDENT, NOT ONLY BASED
ON DIRECT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THE FACT THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY
UNIFORMED MEN DURING THE CURFEW PERIOD AND THAT A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE
CRIME A GROUP OF MILITARY MEN CHECKED OUT THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE
GOING TO COMMIT THE CRIME -- CLEARLY INTENDING TO PREPARE A PLAN --
BUT BECAUSE OF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE JESUITS MADE OVER THE NATIONAL
NETWORK.  WE MUST ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS CRIME WAS A POLITICAL
MISTAKE MADE BY THE DICTATORSHIP.  IT WAS A MISCALCULATION ON THE PART
OF THOSE WHO MADE THAT DECISION.

   WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO
STOP THE FMLN.  THEY COULD NOT STOP THE FMLN PLAN.  ONCE WE BEGAN TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN [1-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] A VERY CRITICAL
SITUATION.

   WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS CRITICAL SITUATION, THEY TOOK THE
WRONG STEP.  THE DAY BEFORE THE CRIME THE ARMED FORCES BEGAN A
STRATEGY TO WEAR OUT THE FMLN, LOGISTICALLY.  WE MUST NOT IGNORE THE
FACT THAT THE ARMED FORCES' CALCULATIONS WERE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION
THAT THE FMLN FORCES WOULD BECOME EXHAUSTED.  WE WOULD HAVE MADE A
SERIOUS MISTAKE IF WE HAD BEGUN THIS PLAN WITHOUT FORESEEING ALL THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES BASED THEIR CALCULATIONS ON
OUR POSSIBLE EXHAUSTION.

   CONSEQUENTLY, BASED ON THOSE CALCULATIONS, THEY FIGURED THAT THEY
HAD 3 OR 4 DAYS TO LAUNCH A COUNTERATTACK.  SO, THE DAY PRIOR TO THE
KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEY LAUNCHED SEVERAL OFFENSIVES -- I
RATHER CALL THEM COUNTEROFFENSIVES -- TO TRY TO DISLODGE US FROM OUR
POSITIONS.  THEIR TACTIC WAS TO MAKE US WASTE AMMUNITION.  THEY WERE
NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE US ABANDON OUR POSITIONS YET.

   HOWEVER, OUR FIGHTERS, IN ADDITION TO SAVING OUR AMMUNITION, HAVE
THE MATERIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES SO THEY INFLICTED MANY CASUALTIES ON
THE ARMED FORCES AND WORE THEM OUT.  BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ARMED
FORCES DID NOT REALIZE THAT AND FELT THAT THEY COULD LAUNCH A BIG
COUNTERATTACK TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN FORCES.  BASED ON THAT, THEY CAME
UP WITH A PLAN THAT WAS NOT ONLY MILITARY BUT POLITICAL.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THE U.S. AMBASSADOR, THE U.S. ADVISERS, THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, AND WHO KNOWS WHO ELSE WERE INFORMED ABOUT THIS PLAN.
THEY MADE THE WRONG INTERPRETATION OF THE CALLS MADE BY THE
INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS ON THE
NEED TO HAVE A TRUCE TO EVACUATE CIVILIANS.  THEY THOUGHT THAT WE MADE
THESE CALLS AND BASED ON THAT, THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD PROCEED TO A
COUNTEROFFENSIVE.

   BASED ON THAT, LET US ANALYZE THE PROPAGANDA AND INFORMATION
DISSEMINATED ON THE DAY PRIOR TO THE KILLING OF THE JESUITS.  THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR HIMSELF EXPLAINED A WAR REPORT AND GAVE AN UPDATE ON THE
SITUATION.  THUS, THEY THOUGHT THAT THE FMLN WAS GOING TO SUFFER A
GREAT POLITICAL AND MILITARY DEFEAT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  THEY HAD
AN OVERALL PLAN.  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH VILLALOBOS, MEMBER OF THE
GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [VILLALOBOS]
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ARMY CARRIED OUT A LARGE BOMB ATTACK ON
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR IN AN EFFORT TO WEAKEN OUR POSITIONS.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A VICTORY THERE.  BUT
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT, ASIDE FROM ALL THE PROPAGANDA THEY USED AND
THE PLAN TO WEAKEN US MILITARILY, THE ARMED FORCES ATTACKED UNION
OFFICES AND THE HOMES OF LEADERS OF POPULAR MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS
SECTORS.  APPARENTLY, EVERYONE HAD GONE INTO HIDING AND THEY ONLY
FOUND THE WIFE OF A UNIVERSITY LEADER AND THEY KILLED HER.  THEY ALSO
FOUND THE JESUITS.  IT SEEMS THAT IN VIEW OF RECENT TALKS WITH
CRISTIANI, FATHER ELLACURIA HAD BECOME VERY TRUSTING.  HE THOUGHT THAT
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM.  [30-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] THIS
SITUATION SO THEY DID NOT PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THE FACE OF THE DANGER
OF A POSSIBLE ACTION SUCH AS THIS CRIME.

   ON THE SAME NIGHT WHEN THE ENTIRE NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AREA WAS
BEING BOMBED, THE JESUITS WERE KILLED.  WHAT WAS THEIR INTENTION?
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TO OBTAIN A MILITARY VICTORY AND SET OUT TO
CARRY OUT A WITCH HUNT.  THEY SET OUT TO KILL ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS
THAT ONE NIGHT, WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WIPE OUT THE
FMLN, MILITARILY.  BASED ON THAT ASSUMPTION, THEY DECIDED TO CARRY OUT
THIS ACTION TO GUARANTEE FOR THEMSELVES A FEW MORE YEARS OF STABILITY
THROUGH THE PEACE OF CEMETERIES, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES.

   WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?  THE DAY AFTER THEY COMMITTED THE CRIME, THEY
LAUNCHED THEIR OFFENSIVE TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN.  THEY THOUGHT THIS
WAS GOING TO BE THEIR DECISIVE DAY, BUT THE OFFENSIVE FAILED.  THEIR
ATTACK WAS REPELLED, THEY SUSTAINED MANY CASUALTIES, AND LOSS MUCH
MATERIEL.  THEIR TROOPS WERE FURTHER BEATEN AND THEY DID NOT OBTAIN
ANY EFFECTIVE MILITARY RESULTS.

   CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR COUNTEROFFENSIVE WAS REJECTED AND THE BLOW THEY
THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO DEAL TO THE LEADERS OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT
FAILED, ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE SOME OF THESE LEADERS WERE HIDING AND
ON THE OTHER BECAUSE THEY COMMITTED AN HORRENDOUS CRIME AND IT
BACKFIRED.  IT WAS A CRIME [WORD INDISTINCT] BY THE GENERAL STAFF AND
MR. CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT.  CRISTIANI CLEARLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND
PROBABLY EVEN THE U.S. EMBASSY COULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS.  THEY
THOUGHT THAT BY KILLING ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS, THEY WERE GOING TO
ACHIEVE DEFINITE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  THIS IS VERY CLEAR.  BUT THIS
ACTION BACKFIRED.  IT WAS A PAINFUL INCIDENT, BUT IT IS AN INCIDENT
THAT IS GOING TO BACKFIRE FOR THE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS GOING TO RESULT
IN GREAT ISOLATION FOR THE REGIME, AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN IS
STRONGER.  AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN HAS A POLITICAL, MILITARY, AND
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE.

   THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS IS SUICIDE FOR THE REGIME.  I REALLY DO
NOT UNDERSTAND IT.  THEY MADE A VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE.  IN ADDITION,
THEY CONFIRMED A TRUTH WE HAVE BEEN MAINTAINING: THEY ARE FASCISTS AND
ASSASSINS.  THEY MUST LEAVE POWER.  THEY HAVE CREATED A SITUATION IN
WHICH THE POSSIBILITY FOR AN FMLN VICTORY IS GREAT.  THEY HAVE CREATED
A SITUATION IN WHICH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE
OLIGARCHIC SECTORS OF THE SALVADORAN SOCIETY WILL BE CAUSED BY THEIR
OWN MISTAKES.  [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 (INTERPRESS AGENCY [IPS]) -- [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS
TODAY PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A SALVATION JUNTA THAT WOULD INCLUDE
THE ARMY AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT],
HUMBERTO CENTENO -- LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION NATIONAL UNION OF
SALVADORAN WORKERS [UNTS] -- HAS ANNOUNCED.  IN STATEMENTS TO IPS,
CENTENO SAID THE FMLN HAS ALREADY SAID IT IS WILLING TO JOIN THE
COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE, AND THAT IT IS WILLING TO BE A PART OF A
SALVATION JUNTA AS A SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL CRISIS.

   THE UNTS' PROPOSAL WAS SUPPORTED BY FIDEL CHAVEZ MENA, CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] NATIONAL SECRETARY AND PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN
AMERICAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION, IN STATEMENTS TO THE
PRESS.  CHAVEZ MENA, WHO WAS THE PDC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE
PAST ELECTIONS, SAID THAT ONE OF THE WAYS TO SOLVE THE CIVIL WAR
PROBLEM WOULD BE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RECTIFY ITS STAND AND INITIATE
NEW NEGOTIATIONS.  WE SHOULD ALL SIT DOWN TO FIND A SOLUTION, HE TOLD
NEWSMEN, ADDING THAT NEITHER SIDE WILL ACHIEVE A MILITARY VICTORY.

   MEANWHILE, CENTENO STATED THAT THE BOMBINGS IN DENSELY POPULATED
AREAS AND THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS ARE FACTORS THAT ARE
WEARING OUT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND.
ACCORDING TO THE LABOR LEADER, NONE OF THE SOCIAL FORCES WITH ANY
REPRESENTATIVE FORCE SUPPORT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS GOVERNMENT.

   ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT A GENERAL CONSENSUS, THE POLITICAL AND LABOR
GROUPS HAVE SAID THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND THE
RESUMPTION OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE OAS AND THE UNITED
NATIONS AS WELL AS THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AS GUARANTORS OF
THE AGREEMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE PETITION MIGHT NOT BE RECEIVED WELL BY A
GOVERNMENT THAT IS APPARENTLY NOT WILLING TO NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE
WITH THE REBELS WHO CONTINUE OCCUPYING THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE
NORTHERN AREA OF THE CAPITAL CITY.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATEMENT]
[GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] WE
CONDEMN GUATEMALAN INTERFERENCE IN EL SALVADOR.

   THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY [URNG] GENERAL COMMAND
EXPRESSES ITS PROFOUND SOLIDARITY AND ADMIRATION FOR THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE AND THEIR VANGUARD FORCES, THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT], WHO WITH GREAT HEROISM AND DETERMINATION,
ARE WRITING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS PAGES IN SALVADORAN HISTORY.

   WITH DEEP INDIGNATION, WE HAVE SEEN HOW THE MEMBERS OF LA TANDONA,
[MEMBERS OF THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY] AND THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT
HEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAVE DECIDED TO CONDUCT AND MAINTAIN MASSIVE
BOMBINGS AGAINST THE DEFENSELESS CIVILIAN POPULATION, THUS SOWING DEATH,
SLAUGHTERING, AND DESTROYING, IN VIEW OF THEIR INABILITY TO DEFEAT,
DISLODGE, OR CONTAIN THE HEROIC FMLN FIGHTERS.

   CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY HAVE LOST CONTROL
OVER THEIR ACTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR DESPERATION OVER THE FMLN'S
VICTORIOUS ADVANCE.  THE FMLN FORCES HAVE NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR
POSITIONS, BUT HAVE ALSO INCREASED THEM IN SAN SALVADOR AND THROUGHOUT
THE REMAINING SALVADORAN TERRITORY.

   ACTING OUT OF REVENGE, CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN
ARMY BEGAN A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS AIMED AT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE
IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES WITH THE FAIR CAUSES OF THE SALVADORAN MAJORITY.
AS A RESULT, EARLY ON THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS
AND TWO HUMBLE WOMEN WHO WORKED WITH THEM WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED.

   WE SHARE THE ENORMOUS PAIN OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT OF THE
JESUIT COMMUNITIES.  WE ADD OUR PROTEST TO THE VOICES OF ALL THOSE WHO
HAVE PROTESTED AGAINST SUCH A VILE MURDER.

   THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNS THOSE ACTIONS AND
CALLS ON THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE AND ON ALL POLITICAL, SOCIAL,
DEMOCRATIC, AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AGAINST
THOSE BARBARIC AND GENOCIDAL ACTIONS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE COMPARED TO
THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM AND THE NAZIS
DURING WORLD WAR II.

   IN OUR STATEMENT ISSUED ON 13 NOVEMBER, WE REPORTED THE
INTERVENTIONIST PLANS OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST OUR FRATERNAL
NATION, EL SALVADOR.  ACCORDING TO REPORTS RELEASED BY PRESS AGENCIES
ON 15 NOVEMBER, 126 GUATEMALAN ARMY MEN BELONGING TO SPECIAL TROOPS
CALLED SAIBILES, WHO CHARACTERIZED THEMSELVES FOR THEIR PATHOLOGIC
SAVAGERY, WERE DEPLOYED.  [SENTENCE AS HEARD] PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE
CHIEF OF THE GUATEMALAN GENERAL STAFF, AND THE GUATEMALAN ARMY
OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN HAVE ALREADY PUBLICLY EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY
AND SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI.

   WE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE INTERFERENCE OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY
AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE CALL ON ALL GUATEMALAN
GROUPS TO PROTEST THAT INTERFERENCE.  WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMY PAY A VERY HIGH PRICE FOR THIS AGGRESSION AGAINST
THE FRATERNAL SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE WARN THE WORLD THAT A GENOCIDE LARGER THAN THE ONE WHICH HAS
ALREADY OCCURRED IS BEING CONDUCTED IN EL SALVADOR NOW.  WE ARE SURE
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT ALL THEIR ENEMIES; THAT THEY WILL BE
THE WINNERS OF THIS HISTORIC STRUGGLE, AND THAT THEY WILL ACHIEVE
THEIR GOALS.

   THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED WILL TURN INTO NEW LIFE.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS OF FREEDOM,
DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

[SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE
HAVE POWERFUL REASONS FOR ENSURING THAT JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED IN THIS
REGRETTABLE INCIDENT IN WHICH FATHER ELLACURIA, OTHER PRIESTS, AND
CIVILIANS WERE KILLED.  WE WANT TO TELL THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO DRAW
PREMATURE CONCLUSIONS TO ABSTAIN FROM DOING SO; WE URGE YOU TO HEED
THE COMMUNITY OF JESUS AND THE ARCHBISHOPRIC OF SAN SALVADOR'S CALLS
THAT THIS CASE NOT BE POLITICIZED OR USED TO GENERATE FURTHER VIOLENCE
IN THE COUNTRY.

   WE BELIEVE THAT AN INVESTIGATION MUST BE CONDUCTED; WE ARE
COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION TO PUNISH THE
PERPETRATORS OF THIS SAVAGE ACTION REGARDLESS OF WHO IS INVOLVED.  THE
ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL
REQUEST HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE SALVADORAN CRIME INVESTIGATION
COMMISSION WILL BE ADVISED BY EXPERTS IN ORDER TO GET TO THE ROOT OF
THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  WE WILL ASK THE UNITED
STATES, GREAT BRITAIN, AND SPAIN TO HELP US.  I MENTION SPAIN BECAUSE
SOME OF THOSE WHO WERE ASSASSINATED ARE CITIZENS OF THAT COUNTRY.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO CONDUCT AN
INVESTIGATION AND ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS SERVED IN REPREHENSIBLE
ACTIONS LIKE THIS ONE INSTEAD OF POLITICIZING THEM AND GENERATING
FURTHER VIOLENCE.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE ARMED FORCES WILL NEVER
ALLOW A RETURN TO THE PAST; A RETURN TO THOSE DRAMATIC AND REGRETTABLE
TIMES IN THE COUNTRY WHEN GROUPS WANTED TO FUTHER THEIR CAUSE THROUGH
VIOLENT ACTS SUCH AS THIS ONE.  WE WILL NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AND
WILL PURSUE SUCH GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT THEY FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF THE
LAW.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) -- [REPORT]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] ON
THE 7TH DAY OF THE OFFENSIVE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] HAS TAKEN A STRATEGIC TURN IN THE WAR, AS WE BEGIN TO
STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN A NEW AND DEFINITE SCENARIO OF OPERATIONS IN THE
CITIES, WITH THE INSURRECTIONAL PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE SEEKING TO
ACHIEVE PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  THE FIGHTING WAGED IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN
MIGUEL, USULUTAN, ZACATECOLUCA, SANTA ANA, AND OTHER PARTS IN THE
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE LEADING ROLE PLAYED BY THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED AND JOINED THE STRUGGLE.

   THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE EXPOSED THE MILITARY FASCIST
DICTATORSHIP TO THE EYES OF THE WORLD.  THE DICTATORSHIP HAS REMOVED
ITS CIVILIAN MASK, AND IT HAS SHOWN ITS BARBARIC NATURE AS IT BOMBED
CITIES AND MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS, WHO WERE MEMBERS OF A NATIONAL
CONSCIENCE THAT IS SEEKING SOCIAL CHANGES AND PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.

   THESE CRIMES COMMITTED BY CRISTIANI AND COLONEL PONCE [CHAIRMAN OF
THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] DEFINITELY ISOLATE
THEM FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH CONDEMNS THEM AND RECALLS THE
LAST DAYS OF SOMOZA.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE U.S.  CONGRESS DISCUSSES
CUTTING MILITARY AID TO THE REGIME.  THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE
LED TO IRREVERSIBLE ACHIEVEMENTS.  THE REGIME HAS BEEN DEFEATED IN THE
POLITICAL FIELD AND FATALY WOUNDED IN THE MILITARY FIELD.

   IN 7 DAYS OF COMBAT IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THE HIGH COMMAND LOST ITS
LAST DEFENSIVE LINE.  OUR FORCES ARE HITTING HARD AT THEIR TIRED
HEART.  VICTORY IS A FACT THAT NO ONE CAN ALTER.

   IN THE OFFENSIVE, WE KILLED OR WOUNDED AN ESTIMATED 827 TROOPS AND
OFFICERS.  WE SEIZED 127 LONG WEAPONS, 21 MACHINEGUNS AND SUPPORT
WEAPONS, AS WELL AS ABOUT 80,000 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION OF VARIOUS
CALIBERS.  WE HAVE CONFIRMED REPORTS THAT WE HAVE DAMAGED 11 AIRCRAFT
AND DESTROYED 27 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS.

   THE HUMILIATING DEFEAT OF THE HIGH COMMAND IS EVIDENT IN A
DEPRESSED COL PONCE, WHO NO LONGER SPEAKS OF THE GUERRILLAS IN POCKETS
ALONG THE BORDER.  INSTEAD, HE SPEAKS IN FRONT OF A MAP OF THE CAPITAL
CITY, POINTING OUT THE PRESENCE AND ADVANCE OF THE FMLN.

   VARIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS OF EL SALVADOR HAVE INITIATED
EFFORTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO ACHIEVE A CONSENSUS IN ORDER TO
FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT THAT WILL PUT AN END TO THE WAR AND BRING ABOUT
THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE COUNTRY.  THE FMLN LOOKS FAVORABLY ON THESE
EFFORTS, AND IT HAS ALREADY ACTIVELY JOINED THESE NATIONAL SECTORS WHO
ARE OPPOSED TO THE GENOCIDE BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE HIGH COMMAND IN A
SUICIDAL ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE THE WAR THAT IT HAS TURNED INTO A
BUSINESS DEAL.

   THE GENERAL COMMAND RECOGNIZES THE HEROISM OF OUR FIGHTERS AND
CALLS ON THEM TO CONTINUE ADVANCING ALONG WITH OUR REBELS IN THE FINAL
CHAPTER OF THIS HISTORY.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 17 NOV 89 (LA REPUBLICA) -- [TEXT] PRD [DEMOCRATIC
REVOLUTIONARY PARTY] COMMUNIQUE:

   TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE LATIN AMERICAN CHURCH MET IN MEDELLIN AND
DECIDED TO WORK FOR THE NEEDY, DEATH SQUADS IN EL SALVADOR HAVE
MURDERED IGNACIO ELLACURIA, A PRIEST, TEACHER, AND A SOCIAL FIGHTER,
ALONG WITH SEVEN OTHER PRIESTS AND FAITHFUL.  A WAR THAT BEGAN WITH
THE MARTYRDOM OF ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO IS NOW TAKING THE
LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS WHO ARE KILLED IN INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS
AND ATTACKS ON THE POPULATION.

   THE CRIME COMMITTED TODAY WAS SPONSORED BY THE SAME ONES WHO ARE
NOW PLANNING GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S MURDER.  THERE IS ONLY A
DIFFERENCE OF TIME AND PLACE.  INSTEAD OF BOMBING DENSELY POPULATED
NEIGHBORHOODS, THESE PEOPLE ARE RESORTING TO ATTACKS ON CERTAIN
FIGURES AND LEADERS.

   BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS SIZE OF THE LATIN AMERICAN CRISIS, IT IS
EVIDENT THAT THE CHURCH CANNOT ESCAPE THE DEMAND THAT MODERN TIMES
IMPOSE ON ALL GROUPS OF DECIDING WHETHER TO BE ON THE SIDE OF
PATRIOTIC AND LIBERTARIAN CAUSES OR TO BECOME ACCOMPLICES OF LOCAL AND
FOREIGN OPPRESSORS.

   LIKE MSGR ROMERO, FATHER ELLACURIA AND HIS COMPANIONS IN MARTYRDOM
REPRESENT THE CHURCH THAT IS BORN FROM THE HOMELAND AND THAT STRUGGLES
ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE.  PANAMANIAN GENERAL OMAR TORRIJOS ALSO DECIDED
TO WORK ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE FROM INSIDE THE ARMED FORCES.  THESE
MARTYRS DESERVE THE SAME SOLIDARITY THEY GAVE TO THE LATIN AMERICAN
CAUSE OF NATIONAL LIBERATION, BECAUSE THEY CHALLENGED THE OLIGARCHY,
IMPERIALISM, AND EVEN THE REACTIONARY GROUPS OF THEIR OWN CHURCH.

   NOW, WHEN ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE LATIN AMERICAN CRISIS AND FOREIGN
AGGRESSION FALLS UPON THE SALVADORAN AND PANAMANIAN PEOPLES; NOW THAT
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE MASSIVELY REPRESSED; AND NOW THAT THE
GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON ORDERS THE CIA TO ATTACK GEN NORIEGA, THOSE
WHO STRUGGLE IN EL SALVADOR AND THOSE WHO PATRIOTICALLY RESIST ARE IN
FACT DOING SO FOR ALL OF LATIN AMERICA.

   THUS, IGNACIO ELLACURIA'S AND HIS PARTNERS' SACRIFICE, AS WELL AS
THE PREVIOUS SACRIFICE OF MSGR ROMERO AND THAT OF GEN NORIEGA, WILL
BEAR FRUITS OF LIBERATION, JUSTICE, AND SOVEREIGNTY.

   THESE FRUITS WILL BE PLENTIFUL AND MORE DELICIOUS IF ALL THOSE WHO
HAVE BEEN NEXT TO AND LEARNED FROM THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE STRUGGLING
WITH THEIR EXAMPLE IN MIND.  THE SACRIFICE THEY HAVE MADE FOR ALL OF
US DESERVES PRAISE AND SOLIDARITY.  WE OFFER THEM THAT PRAISE AND
SOLIDARITY BY REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT TO WORK AND STRUGGLE FOR THE
DEFINITIVE LIBERATION OF OUR OWN PEOPLE.

JOINED IN CONDEMNING VIOLENCE AND THE FMLN, AND SUPPORTING OUR

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE ARE SURE THIS WILL BE OVER SOON.  IN TIMES
LIKE THESE, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS REACTED IN A POSITIVE
MANNER.  SOLIDARITY EXISTS AMONG ALL SALVADORANS TO SEEK AND HELP THE
NEEDIEST.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS READY TO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN
ITS POWER TO ACHIEVE TOTAL NORMALIZATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  IN

TERRORIST ACTIONS OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT].  ON 17 NOVEMBER, THE ARMED FORCES MADE GREAT ADVANCES, AND WE
CAN NOW SAY THAT THE AREA OF ZACAMIL HAS BEEN TOTALLY RECOVERED.  THE
CIVILIAN RESIDENTS OF THAT SECTOR HAVE SUFFERED VERY MUCH.  LIKEWISE,
THE ARMED FORCES CONTROL OTHER AREAS IN MEJICANOS MUNICIPALITY.  THERE
ARE ONLY SOME SMALL POCKETS IN CIUDAD DELGADO AND SOME SECTORS OF
SOYAPANGO MUNICIPALITY WHERE THERE ARE STILL SOME CLASHES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE FMLN INSISTS ON
CONTINUING WITH THESE DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAKE INNOCENT PEOPLE,
WHO ONLY WANT TO BE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND LIVE IN PEACE, GO THROUGH
SOME TRULY DRAMATIC MOMENTS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE
THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE GOING TO DEFINITELY CONTROL ALL OF THESE
FMLN TERRORISTS.  THAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE ARMED FORCES ADVANCE,
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE TRUST THAT EACH DAY WE WILL CONTINUE ADVANCING UNTIL WE HAVE
FULL CONTROL, IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME POSSIBLE, ALWAYS RESPECTING
THE LIVES OF THOSE CIVILIANS IN DANGER.  IN A COWARDLY MANNER, THE
FMLN HIDES BEHIND THESE INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND USES THEM AS SHIELDS.

   WE ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU, SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED IN ANY MANNER TO ABANDON THEIR HOMES THAT,
THROUGH THE EMERGENCY COMMISSION, THE GOVERNMENT IS OFFERING BASIC
SERVICES, AS BEST IT CAN, TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY
DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES.

   WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THE HELP OF ALL THE FRIENDLY COUNTRIES WHO ARE
ALREADY BEGINNING TO HELP AND SEND AID, [CHANGES THOUGHT] FOR EXAMPLE,
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  WE HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT TOMORROW
THE KING OF SPAIN IS SENDING A PLANE LOADED WITH MEDICATION. ANOTHER
PLANE IS BRINGING 55,000 TONS OF MEDICATIONS FROM THE ORDER OF MALTA.
THE SALVADORAN-AMERICAN FOUNDATION IS SENDING A VERY GENEROUS DONATION
OF 200 FIELD TENTS TO BE USED TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR MANY FAMILIES
FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE WEATHER.  THERE IS ALSO THE ROTARY CLUB,
AND THERE IS EVEN A COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED STATES CALLED COOPERATION
CALIFORNIA THAT IS SENDING 3,000 TONS OF CORN.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AS YOU HAVE OBSERVED, AID IS ON ITS WAY.  WE
WANT TO TELL THOSE WHO ARE IN SUCH SITUATIONS, IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
TO REMAIN CALM, TO LISTEN TO THE INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE
CONTINUOUSLY BEING GIVEN OVER THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK, AND TO
COOPERATE AND HELP SO THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD AND MEDICATIONS
CAN BE DONE IN THE BEST ORDERLY MANNER.  WE FEEL THAT WHAT THE COUNTRY
HAD IN STORAGE AND WHAT THESE GENEROUS COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE
DONATING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ATTEND TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING
MOMENTARILY AFFECTED.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC IS ALSO MAKING EFFORTS TO HAVE A
RECONSTRUCTION FUND.  WE KNOW THAT MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN DAMAGED.
THE TERRORISTS HAVE OPENED HUGE HOLES IN ORDER TO MOVE IN BETWEEN        
THESE HOUSES.  THIS COWARDLY ATTACK BY THE FMLN HAS BROUGHT ABOUT
MUCH DESTRUCTION.  ONCE THE SITUATION HAS BEEN NORMALIZED, WE WANT
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT YOU CAN REBUILD
YOUR HOMES AND RETURN TO NORMALCY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

SALVADOR'S TOP MILITARY AND POLITICAL AUTHORITIES, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, VICE
PRESIDENT MERINO, AND THE HEAD OF ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE],
ETC, BLAMING NICARAGUA FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EL SALVADOR.

   THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN SYSTEMATIC AND IT HAS ENCOURAGED TERRORIST
GROUPS TO THREATEN THE LIVES AND SAFETY OF NICARAGUA'S DIPLOMATIC

THREATS FROM EXTREMIST SECTORS AND, I REPEAT, THIS LED THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT TO THE DECISION TO EVACUATE US.

   THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO
COUNTRIES ARE BROKEN.  IT IS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE TO ENSURE THE

SECOND, IS THIS A PROVISIONAL MEASURE OR WILL IT BE EXTENDED; HOW LONG
WILL THIS MEASURE LAST?

   [LACAYO] I CANNOT SAY HOW LONG IT WILL LAST.  THAT IS UP TO THE
GOVERNMENT, AND IT WILL DEPEND ON THE INTERNAL SITUATION IN THE
COUNTRY.  REGARDING YOUR FIRST QUESTION, THE SITUATION IS DIFFICULT.
ON A MILITARY LEVEL, THE WAR CONTINUES; THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF
MISINFORMATION BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND MANY INTERNATIONAL
NEWS AGENCIES.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE BATTLE CONTINUES, THERE HAS BEEN
CONSIDERABLE PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION IN MANY TOWNS AND NEIGHBORHOODS ON
THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR.  YOU KNOW WHICH TOWNS ARE INCLUDED:
ZACAMIL, CIUDAD DELGADO, SOYAPANGO, ETC. THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE
INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS BY THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE.

   [REPORTER] THERE IS A REPORT THAT SOMOZIST GUARDS ARE FIGHTING WITH
THE SALVADORAN ARMY.  IS THERE ANYTHING TO THIS?

   [LACAYO] THERE ARE RUMORS TO THAT EFFECT.  SOME INSURGENT RADIO
STATIONS HAVE REPORTED IT, AND THEY HAVE ALSO MENTIONED TROOPS FROM
OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] YES, BUT NOT WITH THE PERSISTENCE THAT PREVAILS NOW.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] OF COURSE.  MANY TELEPHONE CALLS, SURVEILLACE BY
SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUALS AND VEHICLES AT THE RESIDENCE THROUGHOUT THE
DAY, AND ESPECIALLY DIRECT THREATS BY TELEPHONE.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] I WOULD IMAGINE THEY ARE SALVADORAN RIGHTWING EXTREMISTS,
BETTER KNOWN AS DEATH SQUADS.  THEY BEGAN TO SELECTIVELY SHOOT PEOPLE.
THERE IS THE CASE OF MRS NORMA GIROLA DE HERRERA, PRESIDENT OF THE
WOMENS INSTITUTE, A VERY PROGRESSIVE INSTITUTION.  MRS HERERA WAS VERY
WELL KNOWN, AND SHE WAS MURDERED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES VERY SIMILAR TO
THOSE OF THE ASSASINATION OF THE JESUITS; ON THE SAME DAY.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO[ I DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THE CITY'S
MILITARIZATION.  A STATE OF SIEGE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED, THE
CIRCULATION OF VEHICLES IS MINIMAL, COMMUNICATION IS SPARSE,
TELEPHONES ARE TAPPED.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] YES, THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] THEY ARE WAGING A WAR WHICH CONSISTS AT TIMES OF
MAINTAINING POSITIONS, AT OTHER TIMES OF MOBILIZING.  ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS CONTROLLED AREAS CEASED TO BE CONTROLLED BUT THE WAR
CONTINUES.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] NO, I DO NOT KNOW.  THE GOVERNMENT DID THAT DIRECTLY
THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] NO, BECAUSE WE DID NOT KNOW.  HOWEVER, THE TRUTH IS THAT
WE NEVER HAD PROTECTION.  WE NEVER HAD POLICE PROTECTION AT THE
RESIDENCE ALTHOUGH IT WAS REQUESTED THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  THE
EMBASSY HAD TWO POLICEMEN, BUT DURING THIS PERIOD THEY LEFT AND THE
EMBASSY IS WITHOUT POLICE PROTECTION.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] THAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] AS A REPORT AND IN THE PRESS.
