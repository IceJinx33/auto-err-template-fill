   SAN SALVADOR, 30 OCT 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID POSITIVE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED DURING
THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA.  ONE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS,
CRISTIANI SAID, IS THAT THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD BILATERAL
TALKS WITH SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD BILATERAL
TALKS WITH SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND TO BRIEF THEM ON THE PEACE
PROCESS, THE GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO ATTAIN PEACE, AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE
PEACE PROCESS.  THE PRESIDENTS RECEIVED FIRSTHAND INFORMATION ON THE PEACE
PLAN AND ON THE RESULTS THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS FROM THIS PROCESS [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  I BELIEVE WE HAVE RECEIVED GREAT SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE
PROCESS.  AS A COUNTRY, EL SALVADOR HAS RECEIVED THE LATIN AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS' SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE SUPPORT OF THE
SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WITH WHOM WE HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD
BILATERAL TALKS. [END RECORDING]

   REGARDING THE COFFEE PROBLEM, CRISTIANI SAID THE PRESIDENTS NOTED THE
NEED FOR REACHING AGREEMENTS ON THE COFFEE PACT AND THE PRICE OF COFFEE.
HE ADDED THAT DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT HE CONDEMNED, IN THE PRESENCE
OF ALL PRESIDENTS, THE AID NICARAGUA GIVES TO THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI STATED.

   CONCERNING THE RECENT ATTACKS BLAMED ON THE GUERRILLAS, PARTICULARLY
THE 30 OCTOBER ATTACK ON THE ARMY'S HIGH COMMAND, CRISTIANI SAID THIS IS
REGRETTABLE BECAUSE CIVILIANS ARE MORE AFFECTED BY SUCH ATTACKS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THIS INCIDENT TAKES PLACE AT A TIME WHEN
THE FMLN IS TRYING TO SHOW ITS STRENGTH.  THE FMLN IS ALSO TRYING TO
PROVOKE SOME REACTION FROM THE ARMED FORCES SO THAT THE ARMY, IN A GIVEN
MOMENT, EXERTS PRESSURE TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  I THINK THIS IS
THE REASON FOR THEIR ATTITUDE. [END RECORDING]

   CRISTIANI ADDED THAT SUCH ATTITUDES WILL NOT HINDER THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS IN VENEZUELA.  HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL WILL BE THE
SAME PROPOSAL PRESENTED IN COSTA RICA AND IT WILL BE FULLY DISCUSSED.
HOWEVER, THE PRIORITY WILL ALWAYS BE THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.

YSKL'S NEWS CENTER RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM THE FMLN [FARABUNDO

DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN HAS BEEN SUSPENDED.

   THE INFORMATION SAYS THAT FMLN GENERAL COMMAND MADE THE DECISION GIVEN
THE LATEST ACTIONS CARRIED OUT IN THE COUNTRY--SPECIFICALLY THE ATTACK ON
FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], WHICH RESULTED IN
THE DEATH OF 10 UNION MEMBERS.

   WE REPEAT:  THE FMLN HAS CALLED US TO REPORT THAT THE MEETING SCHEDULED
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, HAS BEEN
SUSPENDED GIVEN THE EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT DAYS, PARTICULARLY
THE KILLING OF 10 LABOR UNION MEMBERS AT THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS ON
TUESDAY, 31 OCTOBER.

   WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION HAS TEMPORARILY
SUSPENDED THE DIALOGUE UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES THE PROTECTION OF
CIVIC-CULTURAL AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COUNTRY.

   CLANDESTINE, 2 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COMMANDER EDUARDO SANCHO,
ALIAS FERMAN CIENFUEGOS, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [BEGIN
RECORDING] [REPORTER] COMRADE SANCHO, WHY HAS THE FMLN DECIDED NOT TO
ATTEND THE CARACAS MEETING?

   [SANCHO] THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND INSTRUCTED ME THIS AFTERNOON TO
ANNOUNCE TO THE NATION A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH WE DECIDED NOT TO ATTEND THE
CARACAS MEETING AND DIALOGUE.  THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE RECENT FENASTRAS
MASSACRE, WHICH WE BELIEVE CANNOT BE IGNORED.  THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER
ATTACK, LIKE THE ONES WE ARE USED TO, BUT AN ATTACK THAT SIGNALS A NEW
POLITICAL ERA SIMILAR TO THOSE WHEN AN ELECTORAL MASSACRE OCCURRED, WHEN
MSGR ARNULFO ROMERO WAS MURDERED, WHEN OTHER CRIMES MARKED NEW STEPS IN THE
NEW FASCIST ESCALATION OF THE DICTATORSHIP NOW LED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI,
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, AND THE GREAT EXECUTIONER AND PERPETRATOR OF
MASSACRES, ELENA FUENTES.  THE MAIN THING IS THAT THE FASCIST MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP, HEADED BY A SMALL ARMED FORCES GROUP, HAS BEEN EXPOSED.  WE
DO NOT THINK THIS CAN BE IGNORED.  THE STATE AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] HAVE
TO PAY A POLITICAL PRICE.  THIS PRICE IS COL PONCE'S RESIGNATION, WHICH IS
NOW DEMANDED BY THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.

   [REPORTER] AFTER THE ATTACK, INSTEAD OF SEEKING A DETENTE, THE ARMY, ON
THE CONTRARY, CONTINUED ITS PROVOCATIONS.  FOR INSTANCE, SEVERAL
PLAINCLOTHES MEMBERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE [WORDS INDISTINCT]
FENASTRAS AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT TOOK THEM PRISONER.  MORE THAN 30 OF
THEM WERE DETAINED.  WE LEARNED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE POLICE RELEASED A
COMMUNIQUE SAYING THEY WOULD STATION ANTIRIOT POLICEMEN AT THE NATIONAL
CEMETERY.  WE ALSO HEARD COL MAURICIO VARGAS SAYING THAT, IF THE DIALOGUE
DOOR IS CLOSED, IT HAS TO BE KICKED OPEN.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
SITUATION AFTER THE COWARDLY ATTACK ON FENASTRAS?

   WE THINK ALL THESE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEATH SQUADS, THE 1ST INFANTRY
BRIGADE, THE POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE ONLY THE OPEN EXPRESSION
OF THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION, WHICH IS TO PLAN A FULL-SCALE CONFRONTATION
WITH THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.  WE THINK THIS INDICATES [WORDS INDISTINCT]
BEHIND THE BACKS OF THE MAJORITY OF ARMED FORCES MEMBERS.  IT IS A
MINORITY WHO HAVE DECIDED ON THESE PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE POPULAR
MOVEMENT.  THIS MOVEMENT, HOWEVER, IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO DISARM THESE
PROVOCATEURS, PRESENT THEM TO THE PRESS, AND HAND THEM OVER TO SHOW THAT
THE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR TREMENDOUS POWER WHENEVER THEY WANT.

   [REPORTER] WITH LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATES OF THE CAPTAIN
GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] IN POWER, AND WITH THE SITUATION THE
ARENA [NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] ERA HAS USHERED IN, IS THERE NO
POSSIBLE SOLUTION THROUGH DIALOGUE?  WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE DO YOU HAVE?

   [SANCHO] I BELIEVE THAT IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND
THE HIGH COMMAND ARE PRACTICALLY DOING AWAY WITH POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES,
AS OUR EARLIER COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AFTER THE FENASTRAS ATTACK INDICATES.
THE END RESULT IS THAT SINCE THERE IS NO POLITICAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH
TO ESTABLISH A POLITICAL GAME WITH CERTAIN POLITICAL RULES FOR THE
OPPOSITION AND STATE FORCES, OUR ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO IMMEDIATELY
TAKE UP OUR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GUARANTEEING THE
SURVIVAL OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AND THE NATION.  THE PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE
RIGHT TO DEFENSE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, AND IT IS GAINING
GREATER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION.

   [REPORTER] THE POPULAR MOVEMENT IS ONCE AGAIN FACING A DECISIVE MOMENT
IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY, AND THE WORKERS ARE GIVING THEIR SHARE OF BLOOD
IN THIS STRUGGLE.  WHAT MESSAGE WOULD YOU SEND TO THE POPULAR MOVEMENT,
ESPECIALLY TO THE COMRADE WORKERS AT FENASTRAS?

   [SANCHO] ON THIS OCCASION, I WISH TO SEND A SPECIAL MESSAGE TO
FENASTRAS.  I MUST TELL THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE INSPIRED BY THE PUREST
CONCEPTS OF THE POPULAR STRUGGLE, TO KEEP THEIR INSPIRATION, TO BE
CREATIVE AND COOL, AND THAT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO CREATE THEIR OWN HISTORY,
THEY ARE TRULY INVINCIBLE.

   I BELIEVE THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE PEOPLE'S FULL SUPPORT AND THAT IT WILL
GRADUALLY GAIN EVEN MORE SUPPORT.  FENASTRAS MUST CONTINUE--AS ITS LEADERS
SAY--ON THE WARPATH.  IN REALITY, THE COST IN LIVES OF LEADERS SUCH AS FEBE
ELIZABETH AND ALL THE OTHERS WHO WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS THOSE KILLED IN
THE PAST, IS QUITE HIGH.  THE COST IS POLITICAL.  IT HAS TAKEN LIVES BUT
THIS, IN REALITY, STRENGTHENS THE ORGANIZATION.  THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE HAS
BEEN ONE OF ANGER AND DISCONTENT, AND THIS DISCONTENT WILL EVENTUALLY TURN
INTO A CLAMOR FOR ARMED STRUGGLE BY SECTORS THAT REALLY [WORDS INDISTINCT]
AND TO ACHIEVE OUR PEOPLE'S FREEDOM. [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] EL SALVADOR'S LARGEST
ORGANIZATION OF LABOR UNIONS, ASSOCIATIONS, AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS TODAY
REGRETTED THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS' DECISION TO SUSPEND THEIR DIALOGUE WITH
THE GOVERNMENT AND EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THIS MEASURE IS NOT "IRREVOCABLE."

   REVERAND EDGAR PALACIOS, THE MAIN REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BAPTIST CHURCH
AND COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE FOR
PEACE, COMPRISING ABOUT 65 ORGANIZATIONS, TOLD THE PRESS ALFREDO
CRISTIANI'S RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN NO INDICATION IT WANTS PEACE.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S (FMLN) GENERAL COMMAND
ANNOUNCED IN A COMMUNIQUE ON 2 NOVEMBER THAT IT HAD CANCELED ANOTHER ROUND
OF THE DIALOGUE SCHEDULED FOR 20-21 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, WHICH
WERE TO CONTINUE TALKS THAT BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER TO END A 10-YEAR CIVIL WAR.

   THE REBELS CLAIMED AN INTENSIFICATION OF REPRESSION AND BLAMED THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES FOR THE MURDER OF 10 UNION MEMBERS IN A
DYNAMITE ATTACK IN SAN SALVADOR ON 31 OCTOBER AND FOR OTHER ATTACKS ON
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND LEFTIST POLITICIANS.

   GUILLERMO ROJAS, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNITY OF SALVADORAN WORKERS
(UNTS), THE MAIN OPPOSITION LABOR UNION, TERMED THE DIALOGUE SUSPENSION AS
"LOGICAL."  ROJAS SAID CRISTIANI HAS GIVEN NO INDICATIONS HE INDEED WANTS
PEACE; QUITE THE CONTRARY, HE HAS "DECLARED WAR ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BY
ORDERING ATTACKS ON LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS."

   MEANWHILE, ARONETTE DIAZ, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFTIST NATIONALIST
DEMOCRATIC UNION (UDN), SAID THE CURRENT SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS
WORRISOME BECAUSE "IT CANNOT TAKE ANY MORE VIOLENCE THAN IT IS ALREADY
ENDURING."

   "THE ONLY THING LEFT IS FOR TANKS TO BE DEPLOYED TO MACHINEGUN ALL OF
US," SHE ADDED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] LEADERS OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION
LABOR UNIONS IN EL SALVADOR TODAY VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE GUERRILLAS'
DECISION TO SUSPEND DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT COMMITS ITSELF TO
GUARANTEEING THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH
THE GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING THE 31 OCTOBER DYNAMITE ATTACK THAT LEFT 10 DEAD
AND 30 WOUNDED, AND ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH PROVIDE "GUARANTEES FOR THE OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) DECISION COINCIDED
WITH THE BURIAL OF THE 10 UNION LEADERS KILLED IN THE BOMB EXPLOSION AT THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE OPPOSITION SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION
(FENASTRAS).

   IN A COMMUNIQUE THE FMLN INSISTED THAT THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST
FENASTRAS "WAS PLANNED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, APPROVED BY THE
PRESIDENT (ALFREDO CRISTIANI), AND CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTES."

   IN THE COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ITS TOP FIVE COMMANDERS, THE FMLN ADDED
THAT "WE MUST PREVENT OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO
COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS SLAUGHTER."

   HUMBERTO CENTENO, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS
(UNTS), WHICH CLAIMS TO HAVE A MEMBERSHIP OF 200,000 PERSONS, SAID THAT
"THIS IS A LOGICAL AND CORRECT DECISION BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS
DECLARED WAR ON THE WORKERS AND NOT ON THE FMLN."

   ORLANDO AREVALO, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL PEASANT WORKERS UNITY--OF A
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC TREND--WONDERED IF IT WAS WORTH IT FOR THE MARXIST
GUERRILLAS TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT WHILE "THE
PEOPLE ARE BEING MURDERED."

   POLITICAL LEADERS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC AND CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC LEANINGS
VOICED THEIR CONCERN OVER THE SUSPENSION OF THE PEACE TALKS AND COMMITTED
THEMSELVES TO CONTACTING THE FMLN LEADERS TO MAKE THEM RECONSIDER NOT
ATTENDING THE THIRD ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE THAT WAS SLATED FOR 20 AND 21
NOVEMBER IN CARACAS (VENEZUELA).

   EDGAR PALACIOS, COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR THE NATIONAL
DIALOGUE (CPDN), REGRETTED THE FMLN'S DECISION AND WARNED THAT "WHEN THE
DOORS TO DIALOGUE ARE CLOSED, THE DOORS TO WAR ARE OPENED."

   SEVERAL OPPOSITION LEADERS POINTED OUT THAT THE SUSPENSION OF THE TALKS
WILL WORSEN THE WAR AND WILL BRING MORE BLOODSHED, BUT HIS OPINION WAS NOT
SHARED BY THE WORKERS, WHO STATED THEY ARE "VICTIMS OF AN OPEN WAR BY THE
GOVERNMENT."

   CENTENO ADDED:  "WHAT MORE WILL HAPPEN?  THE ONLY THING MISSING IS FOR
THE TANKS TO ROLL DOWN THE STREETS AGAINST US.  WE HAVE BEEN ATTACKED, AND
WE--THE WORKERS--HAVE NOT MURDERED ANYONE.  WE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN
POLITICAL DEBATES AND DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT MEET OUR BASIC NEEDS."

   THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN BEGAN A DIALOGUE IN SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO.
IN THE FIRST MEETING, THEY AGREED TO MEET IN COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER TO
DRAFT A CEASE-FIRE THAT WILL END AN INTERNAL WAR THAT HAS LEFT OVER 70,000
DEAD IN 9 YEARS.

ANTIGOVERNMENT SLOGANS AND CARRIED RED FLOWERS.  THE MARCH TOOK PLACE
AMIDST MUCH TENSION BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF MILITARY TROOPS IN

COMMANDER OF THE 3RD INFANTRY BRIGADE, REPORTED ON 31 OCTOBER THAT BETWEEN
JANUARY AND SEPTEMBER, THE ARMY HAD INFLICTED 800 CASUALTIES ON THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] AND SEIZED 300 WEAPONS IN THE
EASTERN AREA OF THE COUNTRY.  COL VARGAS ADDED THAT THE ARMY SUFFERED 443
CASUALTIES DURING THE SAME PERIOD.  THE MILITARY COMMANDER OF THE AREA
ADDED THAT 393 GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND 310 WOUNDED IN MORE THAN 600
CLASHES AND THAT 143 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 300 WOUNDED.

   "QUALITATIVE CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE 3RD INFANTRY BRIGADE SINCE
1984, WHEN THE FMLN CHANGED ITS OVERALL STRATEGY FROM SEIZING POWER BY
MILITARY MEANS TO THE EXTENDED PEOPLE'S WAR WHOSE BASIC ELEMENT IS THE
UPRISING OF THE MASSES," COL VARGAS SAID.

   VARGAS ADDED THAT DESPITE REBEL ACTIONS, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CARRIED
OUT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS AND ARE PROMOTING THE "EASTERN 89" PLAN IN 18
MUNICIPALITIES WITH 40 MILLION COLONS TO COVER THE COLLECTIVE AND
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE.  THEY ARE PREPARING A SECOND PHASE OF THE
PLAN, WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE OTHER THREE DEPARTMENTS.

   VARGAS ALSO REPORTED THAT, BECAUSE 30 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S COFFEE IS
GROWN IN THE EASTERN SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY, THE ARMY IS CARRYING OUT
COMBING OPERATIONS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF THE AREA DURING THE COFFEE
HARVEST.

   REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT - FMLN DIALOGUE HELD IN COSTA RICA, WHICH HE
ATTENDED AS ADVISOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION, VARGAS SAID THE ARMED
FORCES CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMOCRATIC NATURE.  "THERE IS
SOMEONE WHO IS TRYING TO HINDER THE DIALOGUE AND PEACE.  WE REJECT ALL
CHARGES OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND ATTACKS AND
PUBLICLY REITERATE OUR TOTAL SUPPORT FOR THE COUNTRY'S PEACE PROCESS,"
VARGAS ADDED.

ITS ARMED STRUGGLE.  IT MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT 1 DAY AFTER THE "ALFARO
LIVES, DAMNIT" (AVC) GROUP SIGNED A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT
RODRIGO BORJA'S GOVERNMENT.

   THE MPL TODAY EXPRESSED ITS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE ITS ARMED
STRUGGLE AND NOT TO FOLLOW THE AVC'S FOOTSTEPS.  AVC LEADERS AND TWO
ECUADORAN MINISTERS YESTERDAY APPEARED BEFORE THE MEDIA TO FORMALIZE
THE PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AVC AND THE GOVERNMENT.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TO EFE, THE MPL STATES THAT IT WILL NOW
BRANDISH ITS WEAPONS "WITH GREATER FORCE TO ATTAIN FREEDOM FOR
ECUADORAN SOCIETY AND ITS PEOPLE."

   THE MPL COMMUNIQUE CALLS UPON ECUADOREANS "TO STRENGTHEN THE
PEOPLE'S POWER, TO PREPARE TO SEIZE POLITICAL POWER THROUGH
ORGANIZATION AND STRUGGLE UNTIL THE BOURGEOISIE AND IMPERIALISM ARE
DEFEATED, AND TO PROMOTE REVOLUTIONARY UNITY IN THE STREETS, FIELDS,
AND MOUNTAINS."

   THE MPL ACCUSES THE BORJA ADMINISTRATION OF ADDING TO THE PEOPLE'S
PROBLEMS BY AUTHORIZING NEW INCREASES FOR BASIC STAPLES AND BY
"CONTINUING TO VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS."

   ACCORDING TO THE MPL, THERE HAVE BEEN 4 MURDERS, 9 CASES OF
TORTURE, 8 CASES OF DISAPPEARANCES, AND 25 ARBITRARY ARRESTS SINCE
BORJA ROSE TO POWER LAST 10 AUGUST.  MEANWHILE, THE GROUP ADDED, "THE
ACTIONS OF PARAMILITARY SQUADS CONTINUE WITH IMPUNITY."

   LIMA, 9 MAR 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE ATTENDED BY
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS, PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA SAID HERE TODAY THAT HE
SUPPORTS THE CONSTRUCTION "OF NOT ONE BUT FIVE" INTERNATIONAL HIGHWAYS
IN THE AMAZONIAN REGION.

   ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, THE UNITED STATES PRESSURED JAPAN NOT
TO PROVIDE FINANCING FOR THE BRAZILIAN-PERUVIAN PROJECT.

   GARCIA SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAD
HELD TALKS WITH THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AT HIROHITO'S FUNERAL TO
PREVENT THE FINANCING OF THE HIGHWAY.

   SOME REPORTS SAID THAT BUSH HAD HELD TALKS WITH JAPANESE PRIME
MINISTER NOBORU TAKESHITA ON THE NEED TO PRESERVE THE NATURAL
ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY THE AMAZON REGION, WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE
"WORLD'S LUNGS."

   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID: "PRESIDENT BUSH IS A POLITICIAN WITH
WIDE EXPERIENCE.  I DO NOT BELIEVE HE SAID SUCH A THING.  IF HE DID SAY
IT, IT WOULD BE VERY SERIOUS, BECAUSE HE WOULD BE INTERVENING IN OUR
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS."

   BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JOSE SARNEY RECENTLY SAID THAT THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE INTERNATIONAL HIGHWAY IS "A MATTER OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY."

   BRAZIL AND PERU ARE SPONSORING A PROJECT TO BUILD A HIGHWAY THROUGH
THE AMAZON REGION TO JOIN THE BRAZILIAN NORTHWESTERN STATE OF ACRE AND
THE PACIFIC OCEAN.  BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE ASKED FOR JAPAN'S FINANCIAL
SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT.

   IN PRACTICE, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH A LAND CORRIDOR BETWEEN
THE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC OCEANS--AN OLD PROJECT OF THE BRAZILIAN
MILITARY GEOSTRATEGISTS.

   THE BRAZILIAN MILITARY MINISTERS SUPPORTED SARNEY'S POSITION BY
ANNOUNCING THAT THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT "ANY TYPE OF FOREIGN FOREIGN
INTERFERENCE IN THE AMAZON REGION" AND THAT THEY REJECTED AS
"UNACCEPTABLE" THE ATTEMPTS TO LINK THE FOREIGN DEBT WITH INVESTMENTS
TO PRESERVE THE AMAZON FOREST.

   GARCIA INDICATED THAT IF THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO HELP PRESERVE
THE ECOLOGICAL BALANCE, IT SHOULD "SPEED UP DISARMAMENT TALKS WITH THE
SOVIET UNION."  HE ADDED THAT "THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT THE AMAZON
REGION IS TO ELIMINATE DEADLY WEAPONS AND NUCLEAR BOMBS."

   GARCIA THEN REITERATED: "I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAS
SAID THAT, BUT IF HE SAID IT, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A SERIOUS MATTER
AND HE SHOULD GIVE US A CONCRETE OPINION."

   GARCIA DEFENDED RELATIONS WITH BRAZIL BY SAYING: "I BELIEVE
FORTIFYING ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND GEOGRAPHIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO
COUNTRIES IS A NATIONAL OBJECTIVE."  THEN HE ADDED: "BRAZIL IS ONE OF
THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRIES, AND PERU HAS WRONGLY LIVED IN
FEAR OF BRAZIL.  LET US HOPE THAT NOT ONE BUT FIVE HIGHWAYS ARE BUILT
THROUGH THE AMAZON REGION."

   SIXTY PERCENT OF PERU'S 1.3 MILLION SQUARE KILOMETERS LIE IN THE
AMAZON REGION.  THAT MAKES UP NEARLY ONE-FIFTH OF THE ENTIRE AMAZON
BASIN.

POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS, AND INTIMIDATORY CAMPAIGNS AGAINST PEOPLE'S
LEADERS.

   CODEH PRESIDENT RAMON CUSTODIO ISSUED A DOCUMENT ACCUSING STATE SECURITY
ORGANIZATIONS OF BEING LINKED TO A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTS.

   CODEH STRESSED THAT THE MILITARY UNIT IN CHARGE OF "REPRESSION IS
BATTALION 3-16, LED BY COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ."  BATTALION 3-16
WAS CREATED IN 1982 AS AN INTELLIGENCE UNIT AND HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF
ENCOURAGING THE MURDER AND KIDNAPPING OF OPPOSITION POLITICIANS.  THIS
VERSION WAS REJECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES, WHO INSIST THAT THE "3-16" WAS
ABOLISHED MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO.

   CODEH SAYS THAT IN HONDURAS, "FACTS PROVE THAT VIOLATIONS TO HUMAN
RIGHTS ARE SERIOUS AND THAT THE AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING AND
SANCTIONING THEM PUBLICLY DECLARE THEIR LACK OF RESOLVE AND ABILITY TO DO
SO."

   ACCORDING TO CODEH'S VERSION, IN HONDURAS OVER THE PAST 9 YEARS, MORE

   THE TEXT OF THE LETTER FOLLOWS:

MR PASTRANA:

   AN ARTICLE ON PAGE 1 OF YOUR 19 OCTOBER NEWSPAPER MAINTAINS THAT VERY
RELIABLE SOURCES HAD DISCLOSED THAT JOSE GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA SENT A
MESSAGE TO THE FARC LEADERS LAST WEEK PROPOSING AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT
SUBVERSIVE GROUP.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT SUCH A LETTER DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT I HAVE SENT NO
MESSAGE TO ANY OF THE PEOPLE MENTIONED IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.

   HOWEVER, THE WORST PART OF THIS IS THAT THE EVIL INTENTION OF THE
ALLEGED WRITERS OF THE LETTER REACHES THE LIMIT BECAUSE THEY PORTRAY ME AS
THE SELF-CONFESSED CULPRIT OF ALL CRIMES PERPETRATED AGAINST UP [PATRIOTIC
UNION] LEADERS.  IT IS TRUE I WAS ACCUSED OF THE [FORMER UP LEADER JAIME]
PARDO LEAL ASSASSINATION.  HOWEVER, THE COURTS HAVE ALREADY ISSUED A
VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY.  NO MAN HAS EVER BEEN PURSUED IN COLOMBIA WITH SUCH
MALICE.  IT SEEMS THAT THE ENTIRE PENAL CODE HAS FALLEN UPON ME, WHILE MY
OPPONENTS ARE COMPLETELY IGNORED.

   REGARDING THE REST OF THE LETTER, IT DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE MENTIONING
BECAUSE SUCH A LETTER DOES NOT EXIST.  THEREFORE, EVERYTHING IS FALSE.
MOREOVER, ALL SECTORS ARE FULLY AWARE OF MY PRINCIPLES AND MY STRUGGLE
TOWARD THE SO-CALLED FARC GROUPS.

   I CLEARLY WANT TO STRESS MY AGREEMENT WITH THE PROPOSALS MADE BY THE
M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT], ESPECIALLY THOSE DEALING WITH CEASING OFFENSIVE
OPERATIONS AGAINST THE ARMED FORCES AND THE DEFINITE LAYING DOWN OF
WEAPONS.  THESE ARE THE FIRST STEPS TOWARD MAKING COLOMBIA SIT AT THE
NEGOTIATING TABLE, WITH NO EXCLUSIONS.

   THIS IS MY POSITION, AND THIS IS THE TRUTH.  I AM AWARE THAT THE
MISSION OF EACH ONE OF YOU, AS COLOMBIANS, IS TO BRING PEACE BACK TO
COLOMBIA.

   YOURS FAITHFULLY,

   JOSE GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA

   BOGOTA, 3 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] FOUR PEOPLE
KILLED, FIVE INJURED, AND LOSSES ESTIMATED TO BE IN THE MILLIONS ARE
THE RESULT OF A CAR BOMB EXPLOSION IN BOGOTA, THE POLICE REPORTED TO
RADIO CADENA NACIONAL.  THE CAR BOMB WAS LEFT UNDER THE BRIDGE ON 68TH
STREET AND 13TH STREET WHERE IT EXPLODED AT APPROXIMATELY 1100,
KILLING MARIA JACINTA PULIDO, 42; PILAR PULIDO, 19; A MINOR REPORTEDLY
KNOWN AS CARLOS; EFRAIN RINCON RODRIGUEZ, AND A POLICE OFFICIAL WHO
DIED AT THE POLICE CLINIC.

   AFTER THE INVESTIGATIONS, THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THE VEHICLE
USED IN THIS ATTACK WAS A 1981 BLUE CHEVROLET WITH LICENSE PLATE NO
FD-03904.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE BOMB EXPLODED THE VEHICLE WAS USING LICENCE
PLATES NO IC-9394.  THE REMOVAL OF THE CORPSES WAS SUPERVISED BY 3D
DISTRICT JUDGE JAIME BERNARDO CHAVEZ BOLANOS.  THE BLAST DAMAGED SHOWCASES
OF AT LEAST 30 STORES AND DESTROYED SOME 20 FOOD STANDS.  ALTHOUGH THE
BOMB EXPLODED UNDER THE BRIDGE, IT WAS NOT SERIOUSLY DAMAGED AND
SUSPENSION OF TRAFFIC WAS UNNECESSARY.

   SANTA FE (ARGENTINA), 4 MAY 88 (NA) -- [EXCERPT] TWO MEDIUM-SIZED
BOMBS EXPLODED EARLY THIS MORNING AT THE HOUSE OF JUDGE GUILLERMO
TORRE ALDAY AND AT THE OFFICES OF LAWYER LUIS ROSSMAN, A FORMER
DIRECTOR OF THE SANTA FE PROVINCIAL BANK.  THE EXPLOSIONS CAUSED SOME
DAMAGE, BUT NO CASUALTIES.

   JUDGE RAMIRO PUYOL IS CARRYING OUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE TWO
CASES, BUT SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO POSITIVE RESULTS.

   THE TWO BOMBS EXPLODED ONLY MINUTES APART AND CAUSED MINOR DAMAGE
TO THE WALLS OF THE TWO PREMISES.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.

   ACCORDING TO SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE BOMB SQUAD OF THE LOCAL POLICE,
THE TWO BOMBS WERE PLANTED WITH THE EXCLUSIVE PURPOSE OF INTIMIDATING
THE OWNERS OF THE PREMISES.

   THIS AFTERNOON SOURCES CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION ANNOUNCED THAT
BOTH ATTACKS HAD THE INTENTION OF "FRIGHTENING" TORRE ALDAY AND
ROSSMAN, WHO WAS DIRECTOR OF THE PROVINCIAL BANK OF SANTA FE DURING
GOVERNOR JOSE VERNET'S TENURE.

   IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT BOTH TORRE ALDAY AND ROSSMAN ARE LINKED TO
THE BANKRUPTCY CASES OF SOME LOCAL ENTERPRISES.  THEREFORE, IT IS
THOUGHT THAT THE ATTACKS HAD THE INTENTION OF INTIMIDATING BOTH MEN.

   JUDGE PUYOL IMMEDIATELY BEGAN HIS INVESTIGATION INTO THE TWO CASES,
WHICH, ACCORDING TO SOME MEMBERS OF THE BOMB SQUAD, "DO NOT HAVE ANY
POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS."  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   GUATEMALA CITY, 20 MAY 88 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALA'S
CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION "SECRET ANTICOMMUNIST ARMY" (ESA) HAS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WEDNESDAY'S TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE RESIDENCE
AND OFFICE OF ALEKSANDR TRUSHIN, TASS CORRESPONDENT IN GUATEMALA.

   AN ESA BULLETIN DISTRIBUTED TO THE NEWS MEDIA STATES THAT THE
ATTACK AGAINST THE SOVIET NEWS AGENCY "WAS TO EXPRESS REJECTION OF THE
SOCIALIST-LEANING MEASURES" ADOPTED BY THE VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO
GOVERNMENT.

   THE DOCUMENT EXPLAINS THAT "THIS IS A WARNING," BECAUSE IF ARREST
WARRANTS ARE ISSUED FOR THE FIVE CIVILIANS INVOLVED IN THE ABORTIVE 11
MAY COUP, "ACTIONS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE
GUATEMALAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY," WHICH IS THE RULING PARTY.

   THE ATTACK, CARRIED OUT WITH TWO BOMBS, WAS PERPETRATED AGAINST THE
SOVIET NEWSMAN'S HOME, LOCATED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA SOUTH OF THIS
CITY.  THIS OCCURRED ON 18 MAY.

   THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WERE HURLED FROM AN AUTOMOBILE.  IT DESTROYED
AN ENTRANCE AND WINDOWS OF THE HOME AS WELL AS TRUSHIN'S CAR.
HOWEVER, NEITHER TRUSHIN NOR HIS WIFE WERE INJURED.

   THE COMMUNIQUE BY ESA, A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT EMERGED IN
THE 1960'S, ADDS THAT IT "WILL NOT REST UNTIL THE COMMUNIST AGGRESSION
HAS BEEN STOPPED AND ITS DEFEAT ACHIEVED."

   IT ALSO SAYS THAT "THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING REVOLUTION.
IF IT WANTS WAR, IT WILL HAVE WAR BECAUSE WE ARE READY TO DIE AND TO
FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM ANY TIME."

   THE DOCUMENT, SIGNED BY COMMANDERS "UBICO TOROKZIK" AND "RAFAEL
NETANAGIUHI," SAYS THAT DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR GRAMEJO,
FOREIGN MINISTER ALFONSO CABRERA, AND PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO
PLANNED THE COUP.

   ACCORDING TO THIS COMMUNIQUE, IN THE RECENT TRIP TO CUBA BY RAQUEL
BLANDON, WIFE OF PRESIDENT CEREZO AREVALO, SHE MET WITH LIBYAN AHMAD
MUSTAFA [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] "TO ASK HIM FOR ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR
THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1990."

   ESA IS OPPOSED TO THE ISSUANCE OF ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST MARIO
DAVID GARCIA, DANILO ROCA, NICOLAS BUONAFINA, GUSTAVO ANZUETO VIELMAN,
AND MARIO CASTEJON.  THESE ARE THE CIVILIANS WHOM THE CEREZO AREVALO
GOVERNMENT HAS ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT.

   THIS GROUP STRESSES THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS A "PLOY PROMOTED BY GEN
HECTOR GRAMEJO.  THAT IS THE BASEST THING THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER
COULD HAVE DONE: TO SELL HIMSELF AND HIS MILITARY COLLEAGUES."

   ESA MEMBERS DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS "GUATEMALA'S PROGRESSIVE
PATRIOTS," AND THEY REAFFIRM THAT THE ATTACK ON THE TASS MISSION "WAS
A WARNING."

GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO CARRY OUT A "CONSTITUTIONAL COUP" TO CONSIST OF
TRANSFERRING PART OF ITS POWER TO THE ARMED FORCES TO PHYSICALLY
ELIMINATE PROGRESSIVE SECTORS, COLOMBIAN PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) LEADER
BERNARDO JARAMILLO TOLD THE MEDIA.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY THE OFFICIAL [CZECHOSLOVAK] CTK PRESS
AGENCY, JARAMILLO SAID THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS NOT HELPING THE
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN THIS ATTEMPT TO TRANSFER POWER, AS IS EVIDENT
IN THE FACT THAT IT HAS REJECTED SEVERAL PRESIDENTIAL DECREES THAT
STRESS THE CURRENT STATE OF SIEGE NORMS THAT HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT IN
COLOMBIA SINCE 1948.

   JARAMILLO CHARGED THE GOVERNMENT WITH "LACKING THE POLITICAL
WILLINGNESS" TO HALT THE MURDER OF ACTIVISTS AND POLITICAL AND LABOR
LEADERS AND THE MASSIVE MURDER OF PEASANTS, AS WELL AS TO PURGE ARMY
MEMBERS "CLEARLY COMMITTED TO THESE CRIMES AND TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS
CONFIRMED BY THE COLOMBIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL."

   "THE LINKS BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS OR NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS
WITH THE NARCOTRAFFICKERS PROVIDES THE UNITED STATES WITH A PRETEXT TO
MEDDLE IN LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WAS CLEARLY EVIDENT RECENTLY IN
PANAMA," JARAMILLO ADDED.

   THE VISIT TO PRAGUE OF JARAMILLO AND THE ACCOMPANYING DELEGATION IS
PART OF A EUROPEAN TOUR, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RESOLUTION
APPROVED IN APRIL DURING THE 7TH UP NATIONAL PLENUM THAT SOUGHT TO
PROMOTE THE PARTY'S PRESENCE ABROAD.

   1. AT 2300 ON 23 [AS HEARD] MAY, NEAR CAYARA, VICTOR FAJARDO
PROVINCE, AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT, A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY 100
SUBVERSIVES AMBUSHED A TWO-VEHICLE ARMY PATROL ON A RELIEF OPERATION
BETWEEN THE TOWNS OF SAN PEDRO DE GUAILLAS AND HUANCAPI.

   2. THE FOLLOWING MEMBERS OF THE PERUVIAN ARMY DIED AS A RESULT OF
THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK: CAPTAIN JOSE URBULU SIMO, SECOND SERGEANT ANGEL
VARGAS SAMARA, AND CORPORALS FAVIAN ROLDAN ORTIZ AND CARLOS ESPINOZA
DE LA CRUZ.  FIFTEEN ARMY PERSONNEL WERE ALSO WOUNDED DURING THE
ATTACK, FOUR OF THEM SERIOUSLY.  THE CAPTAIN AND OTHER PERSONNEL KILLED
DURING THE OPERATION WERE BURIED ON 16 MAY IN LIMA AND HUARAS,
RESPECTIVELY.

   THE ARMY PERSONNEL KILLED SIX UNIDENTIFIED SUBVERSIVES WHILE
REPELLING THE ATTACK.  THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT AN UNSPECIFIED
NUMBER OF SUBVERSIVES WERE ALSO WOUNDED.

   3. PERUVIAN ARMY REINFORCEMENT PATROLS PURSUED THE SUBVERSIVE
COLUMN, WHICH TOOK FLIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF CAYARA.  THE PATROL FOUND
THE TOWN COMPLETELY EMPTY AND ABANDONED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME
CHILDREN AND OLD PEOPLE WHO REPORTED THAT FOUR DEAD BODIES WERE LEFT
IN THE TOWN'S CHURCH.

   4. DURING THE SEARCH OPERATION AROUND CAYARA, THE PATROLS CLASHED
WITH SUBVERSIVES AND KILLED AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER.

   5. ON 16 MAY THE POLITICAL-MILITARY COMMAND REPORTED THE ATTACK TO
THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN AYACUCHO AND ASKED THE COURT TO INTERVENE.
THE PERUVIAN ARMY HAS ALSO BEGUN AN INQUIRY INTO THE MATTER.

   6. THE FALSE REPORT BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES OF THE KILLING OF A LARGE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM CAYARA IS COMPLETELY GROUNDLESS.  THE REPORT OF
AN ALLEGED BOMBARDMENT IS ALSO FALSE.  ALL THIS HAS THE SOLE PURPOSE OF
HINDERING THE ACTION OF THE FORCES OF ORDER WHO ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE
THE CRIMINAL SUBVERSIVES WHO AMBUSHED THE ARMY PATROL.

   7. THE SEARCH OPERATION CONTINUES AND THE RESULTS WILL BE REPORTED
AS SOON AS THEY BECOME KNOWN.

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] WE INFORM THE
WORKING CLASS, STUDENTS, AND SALVADORAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL: AS OF 16
MARCH, THE DATE SET BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] TO BEGIN ITS NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, ALL OUR MILITIA
UNITS WILL BE IN FIGHTING SPIRITS AND WILL ATTACK TRANSPORTATION
VEHICLES SUCH AS TAXIS, MINIBUSES, PICKUP TRUCKS, GOVERNMENT VEHICLES,

   WE WARN THE POPULATION NOT TO RIDE MILITARY VEHICLES, BECAUSE THEY WILL
BE AMBUSHED.  IN EMERGENCY CASES AT NIGHT OR EARLY IN THE MORNING, PEOPLE
SHOULD RIDE PRIVATE OR FIRST-AID VEHICLES AND SHOULD DISPLAY A WHITE FLAG.
WE ALSO URGE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE, BECAUSE THAT VOTE WILL
CONTRIBUTE TO WORSEN THE WAR AND WILL SUPPORT THE COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN OF
THE YANKEE IMPERIALISTS' AND THEIR SERVILE LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

   IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT NEITHER THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY NOR THE
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE WANT A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR.  IN
RESPONSE TO THEIR REFUSAL, LET US NOT VOTE IN THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS; LET US
VOTE IN THE 15 SEPTEMBER ELECTIONS.

   THAT MUST BE THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE TO THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS.  THE BALLOT
BOXES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE [WORD INDISTINCT] WILL BE SABOTAGED, AND PERSONNEL
PARTICIPATING IN THAT ELECTION GAME WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY ANNIHILATED,
BECAUSE THEIR PARTICIPATION MEANS THEY AGREE WITH THE ELECTIONS AND SUPPORT
THE WORSENING OF THE WAR.

   NO TO THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS, BECAUSE THEY ARE A DEMAGOGIC AND FRAUDULENT

MINISTER JAIME DE LA SOTTA AND FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE
ERRAZURIZ WILL LEAVE TONIGHT FOR THE UNITED STATES IN AN ATTEMPT TO
ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  THEY WILL
TAKE LAN-CHILE FLIGHT 141 THAT DEPARTS AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 FROM
SANTIAGO AND GOES DIRECTLY TO NEW YORK.

   IN NEW YORK, THE TWO MINISTERS WILL TAKE ANOTHER PLANE TO WASHINGTON AND
WILL ARRIVE AT APPROXIMATELY NOON TOMORROW. IN THE U.S. CAPITAL THEY WILL
MEET WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.

   THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE TRIP IS TO ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON
IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  U.S. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE BAN OVER AN UNUSUAL
TELEVISION NETWORK FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY THAT SOME CHILEAN GRAPES WERE
LACED CYANIDE.  DE LA SOTTA STATED THAT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DAMAGE
THAT TERRORISM CAN CAUSE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DE LA SOTTA] YOU CAN SEE AND MEASURE THE SCOPE OF A
TERRORIST ACT SUCH AS THE ONE WE HAVE JUST EXPERIENCED, THE SOLE OBJECTIVE
OF WHICH IS TO CAUSE HARM. THIS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED BY THE ADVERTISEMENT,
NOT A CLEAR AND CONCRETE ADVERTISEMENT, BUT AN ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALL BY
WHICH THEY WARNED US, THAT IS, THEY WARNED THE EMBASSIES THEY CALLED, THAT
THEY WOULD CARRY OUT SUCH AN ACT.  THIS CALL WAS MADE 3 DAYS AFTER THE
DEPARTURE OF THE FRUIT SHIPMENT.  WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE SITUATION TO
THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, FOLLOWING TECHNICAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE AMOUNT OF
SAMPLES TAKEN.  THEN WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE SITUATION WAS UNDER CONTROL, THAT
IT WAS AN ANOMYOUS CALL AND AS SUCH COULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  LATER, IN
THE SHIPMENTS THAT ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES LAST WEEKEND, THE PRESENCE
OF CYANIDE WAS DETECTED IN TWO GRAPES.  [END RECORDING]

   DE LA SOTTA ADDED THAT ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO OVERCOME THE
IMPASSE.  THE MAJOR PROBLEM NOW INVOLVES THE 17 MILLION BOXES THAT ARRIVED
AT THEIR PORTS OF DESTINATION READY FOR DISTRIBUTION.  NOW NO ONE KNOWS WHAT
TO DO WITH THEM.  THERE ARE 7 OR 8 MILLION BOXES MORE BEING SHIPPED TO THE
SAME PORTS, AND 3 MILLION BOXES REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY, READY TO BE SHIPPED.
DE LA SOTTA SAID THAT THE CYANIDE WAS FOUND IN TWO SINGLE GRAPES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DE LA SOTTA] THE ESSENTIAL THING, I BELIEVE, IS [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN ADOPT MEASURES.  WE WILL TALK WITH
THE HEALTH OFFICIALS TO GIVE THEM THE NECESSARY ASSURANCES SO THEY CAN LIFT
THE BAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  [END RECORDING]

   IN ORDER TO FACE THE PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS CREATED THREE COMISSIONS
TO STUDY THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM, THE AGRICULTURE MINISTER
STATED.

HUGE LOSS WILL CREATE ALL TYPES OF PROBLEMS, NOT ONLY FOR THE FARMERS,
EXPORTERS, AND FINANCIAL SECTOR, BUT ALSO FOR THE SEA AND AIR TRANSPORTATION

   IN THIS PROCESS, WE HAVE SHOWN FLEXIBILITY TOWARD PROPOSALS PRESENTED BY

SHIPMENTS OF WEAPONS AND MORE MILLIONS IN AID.

   THERE WILL BE NEW ELECTION FRAUD AND DISPUTES BETWEEN THOSE WHO MURDERED
MONSIGNOR [OSCAR ARNULFO] ROMERO AND MASSACRED 70,000 SALVADORANS,

OFFICIALLY FORMED. THE CEREMONY, HELD AT THE NATIONAL PARTY
HEADQUARTERS IN THE OLD AND VENERABLE FERNANDEZ CONCHA CLUB, WAS
PRESIDED OVER BY SERGIO ONOFRE JARPA, PATRICIO PHILLIPS, AND JAIME
TORMO.

   DURING THE CEREMONY, RADICAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY HEAD JAIME TORMO SAID THAT
THE THREE PARTIES WILL NOW START ANALYZING THEIR COMMON POSITIONS, UNDER THE
EFFECTIVE COORDINATION OF NATIONAL RENEWAL SECRETARY ANDRES ALLAMAND.

   JORGE MARTINEZ, OF THE NATIONAL PARTY THEN READ A JOINT DECLARATION.
THE THREE PARTIES REPORTED THAT ONE OF THEIR GOALS IS TO RESTORE THE
MIDDLE CLASS'S DIGNITY AND ITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS, BECAUSE THIS CLASS
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST SPONSOR OF NATIONAL INTELLECTUAL, MATERIAL,
AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.

   ANOTHER GOAL IS TO PREVENT THE COALITION FROM BECOMING A SUPER PARTY OR
MERGING WITH OTHER PARTIES. THIS COALITION WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AS SUCH,
AND ITS OBJECTIVE IS TO PROMOTE COOPERATION, BOTH AMONG MEMBER PARTIES AND
WITH PARTIES THAT MAY WANT TO JOIN THEM IN THE FUTURE.

   THE FIRST OFFICIAL ACT OF THE CENTER-RIGHT POLITICAL COALITION WAS TO
SEND A CABLE TO U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH TO POINT OUT THE SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MEASURES THE UNITED STATES HAS ADOPTED AGAINST CHILEAN
FRUITS.  

   THE CABLE, WHICH WAS READ BY ANDRES ALLAMAND, STATED:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] IN VIEW OF THE GROUNDLESS AND EXAGGERATED MEASURES
TAKEN BY SOME MEMBERS OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION AGAINST CHILEAN FRUIT EXPORTS,
WE CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THESE MEASURES WILL RUIN A LARGE
SECTOR OF CHILEAN PRIVATE ENTEPRISE, WILL LEAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
WORKERS JOBLESS, AND WILL CAUSE A SERIOUS IMBALANCE IN OUR BALANCE OF
PAYMENTS. THESE MEASURES WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE GOOD RELATIONS THE
CHILEAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS HAD WITH THE U.S. PEOPLE, AND THEY WILL DEEPLY
INJURE THOSE WHO, LIKE US, DEFEND FREE ECONOMY AND FREE TRADE.

   MOST SERIOUS, HOWEVER, IS THE FACT THAT THESE MEASURES APPARENTLY REWARD
THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AGAINST CHILE, BECAUSE THEY HELP THE TERRORISTS
ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. [END RECORDING] 

   THE CABLE ADDS THAT CHILE HAS EARNED JUSTIFIED PRESTIGE AS A SERIOUS AND
EFFECTIVE EXPORTER; THAT IT HAS BEEN HONORING ITS FOREIGN DEBT AT A
SACRIFICE; AND THAT IT HAS COOPERATED IN SEVERAL PUBLIC WELFARE PROJECTS
SPONSORED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IN VIEW OF ALL THAT, THE COALITION
REQUESTS AN URGENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.

THE SUSPICIOUS LOOKING PERSONS WHO CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS.  CONSEQUENTLY,
THE ARMY SET UP AN AIR LIFT.  THE LANDING STRIP WAS LOCATED IN A CLEARING
NEAR THE TOWN OF PUEBLO NUEVO.

   MILITARY VEHICLES WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN WITH SOLDIERS COMING OR GOING TO
THE MOUNTAINS.  "PAINTED - FACE" SOLDIERS WERE SEEN GOING TO THE MOUNTAINS,
WHICH THEY "COMBED" UNTIL THEY REACHED PINALEJO, SANTA BARBARA.

   "THE SILENCE IN THESE MOUNTAINS WAS SOMETIMES DISRUPTED BY SHOTS AND WE
WERE AFRAID.  WE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO COVER OURSELVES FROM HEAD TO
TOE," AN OLD MAN, WHO WAS TOO AFRAID TO REVEAL HIS NAME, STATED.

   DURING THE DAY, THE PEOPLE MINGLE WITH THE MEN IN UNIFORM, WHO SOMETIMES
STOP PEOPLE TO ASK WHERE THEY COME FROM AND CAREFULLY SEARCH VEHICLES --
PARTICULARLY WHEN TRAVELING TO AND FROM THE MILITARIZED COMMUNITIES.

   COLONEL ERICK O'CONNOR, COMMANDER OF THE 105TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, ARRIVED
ON SATURDAY TO INSPECT THE AREA WHERE THE OPERATION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT.
HE REFUSED TO ISSUE A STATEMENT WHEN APPROACHED BY LA TRIBUNA'S REPORTERS,
BUT ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMMAND POST WOULD ISSUE AN OFFICIAL REPORT TODAY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 MAR 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] DEFENSE
MINISTER GENERAL CARLOS EUGENIO VIDES CASANOVA TODAY URGED THE
POPULATION TO VOTE IN THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS DESPITE THE RISKS POSED
BY THE GUERRILLA BOYCOTT.

   VIDES CASANOVA SAID THE ARMY IS READY AND HAS IMPLEMENTED MILITARY
MEASURES TO COUNTER THE BOYCOTT AGAINST THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS, IN WHICH 1.8
MILLION SALVADORANS WILL ELECT THE SUCCESSOR TO CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE.

   VIDES CASANOVA ADMITTED THE REBEL BOYCOTT WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF
VOTERS AND THAT THIS MEASURE WILL AFFECT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE SAME
DEGREE.  HE STRESSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT WANTS TO
DISCREDIT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND CAPITALIZE ON THE NUMBER OF NULL VOTES
AND ABSTENTIONS.

   VIDES CASANOVA NOTED ELECTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE 19 MARCH IN 240 SALVADORAN
MUNICIPALITIES BUT THAT THERE ARE 22 TOWNS, PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTHERN AND
EASTERN REGION, WHERE VOTING WILL NOT TAKE PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN VERY
DANGEROUS AREAS.

   VIDES CASANOVA SAID THAT DESPITE GUERRILLA TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, THE ARMY
CONTINUES TO RESPECT THE CEASE-FIRE DECLARED ON 28 FEBRUARY TO SUPPORT
PRESIDENT DUARTE'S PEACE PROPOSAL.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 MAR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT]
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS DECIDED TO
COMBINE THE PEOPLE'S REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS WITH AN
INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE NATION. THIS INCLUDES THE
NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, WHICH WE NOW DECLARE TO BE
INDEFINITE.

   THE REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS BY OUR PEOPLE AND THE IMPACT OF
OUR ACTIONS HAVE LED THE REGIME TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN OF DISINFORMATION,
AGGRESSION, AND THREATS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN A BID TO CONFUSE
THE POPULATION AND, IN ADDITION, TO SET THE STAGE FOR AN ELECTORAL FRAUD.

   IN ORDER TO MAKE MATTERS CLEAR TO OUR PEOPLE AS WELL AS TO THE LOCAL AND
INTERNATIONAL PRESS, WE REPORT THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE GAGGING OF THE NATIONAL PRESS IS PART OF THE PLAN TO COVER UP THE
FRAUD THAT WILL BE COMMITTED ON 19 MARCH.  IN ADDITION, THE CONTROL OVER THE
MEDIA IS INTENDED TO ATTRIBUTE TERRORIST ACTIONS TO THE FMLN.

   2.  THE REGIME HAS TRIED TO BLAME US FOR A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, SUCH AS THE
ATTACK ON A RED CROSS AMBULANCE, AMONG OTHERS, FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.  THE
FMLN HAS A DEFINITE POLICY OF NOT HARMING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THE
HURLING OF GRENADES AT BUS STOPS IS A COMMON PRACTICE OF ARMY PERSONNEL AND
IT IS THEREFORE PREPOSTEROUS TO BLAME THE FMLN.

   3.  A NUMBER OF FALSE COMMUNIQUES WITH AN OBVIOUS TERRORIST TONE HAVE
APPEARED.  THEY CLUMSILY GLORIFY VIOLENCE AND THREATEN THE PRESS IN TERMS
THAT ARE QUITE UNLIKE THOSE APPEARING IN DOCUMENTS IN WHICH WE OUTLINE OUR
OFFICIAL POSITION.  WE EMPHATICALLY STATE THAT THE FMLN HAS IN NO WAY OR AT
ANY TIME THREATENED THE PRESS OR THE CITIZENS.  WE RECALL THE FACT THAT OUR
OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUES ARE SIGNED BY OUR GENERAL COMMAND AND BROADCAST THROUGH
OUR STATIONS.

   WE REITERATE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL THING AT THIS TIME IS TO REINFORCE AND
EXPAND UNITY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS.  THE
STRUGGLE WHICH WE ARE WAGING WITH WEAPONS IN HAND IS AIMED AT AN ARMY THAT
HAS ONCE MORE DENIED TO OUR NATION THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING A FORMULA FOR
A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AT AN IMPORTANT CROSSROADS IN THE NATION'S HISTORY.

   WE MADE A PROPOSAL TO HOLD FREE ELECTIONS, IN PEACE AND FOR PEACE, BUT
THE ARMY STUBBORNLY INSISTS ON HOLDING FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS, AT WAR AND FOR
WAR.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD DURING WAR.

LISTENER WHO IS GOING TO TELL US ABOUT TWO EXPLOSIONS JUST BEFORE NOON

   [LISTENER] SONORA LISTENERS, THIS IS A LAST MINUTE REPORT.  JUST A FEW
MINUTES AGO, AT 1130, TWO BOMBS EXPLODED HERE AT THE EASTERN END OF THE
CENTRAL MARKET.  FIVE PERSONS WERE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN THIS TERRORIST
ATTACK.  THEY WERE JUST TAKEN TO THE ROSALES HOSPITAL.  THE WOUNDED INCLUDE
A CHILD AND A WOMAN.  WE DID NOT GET THEIR NAMES BECAUSE THE AUTHORITIES DID
NOT LET US DO SO.  RED CROSS PERSONNEL TOOK THE WOUNDED TO ROSALES HOSPITAL.

   THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE VERY FRIGHTENED AND ARE RUNNING AROUND.  THE
PEOPLE WERE BUYING FOOD WHEN THE EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED.  THEY ARE NERVOUS AND
ARE TRYING TO QUICKLY FIND TRANSPORTATION.  THE EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD FAR
FROM HERE.  AT THE MARKET'S EASTERN GATE, WHERE THE FRUIT STANDS ARE
LOCATED, WE WERE TOLD BY PASSERSBY THAT A MAN WORKING THERE WAS THE MOST
SERIOUSLY WOUNDED BY THE BOMBS.  ALL THE WOUNDED WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.

   THE TERRORISTS LEFT A COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP BY THE
NATIONAL POLICE.

   THE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING THE MARKET.  THEY CANNOT CONTINUE SHOPPING BECAUSE
IT IS ASSUMED THIS WAS A WARNING TO KEEP THE PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT OR GOING
TO VOTE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 18 MAR 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [TEXT] ON THE EVE OF
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
IN SAN SALVADOR IS PARALYZED WHILE A MAJORITY OF THE RESIDENTS ARE NOT
RECEIVING POTABLE WATER OR ELECTRIC POWER.

   REPORTS ARRIVING THIS MORNING FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL, STATE
THAT CITIES SUCH AS MEJICANOS, SAN MARCOS, APOPA, ISUSTEPEQUE, AND
DELGADO, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE NOT RECEIVED BASIC PUBLIC SERVICES FOR THE PAST
3 DAYS.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE THIS MORNING REPORTED THAT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN
SAN SALVADOR HAS BEEN MORE THAN 80 PERCENT HALTED FOR THE 3D DAY IN A ROW
AND ONLY CERTAIN MINIBUSES AND LIGHT CARGO VEHICLES ARE SERVING CERTAIN
ROUTES.

   WORKERS AT THE EASTERN AND WESTERN BUS TERMINALS OF THIS CAPITAL REPORT
THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SITUATION IS SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY'S.  NO BUSES HAVE
ARRIVED OR DEPARTED SAN SALVADOR FOR THE COUNTRY'S 13 DEPARTMENTS.

   MUCH CENTRAL AMERICAN COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION IS ALSO PARALYZED BY THE
TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE IN EL SALVADOR SINCE MANY RAILROAD BOXCARS ARE BEING
HELD UP AT THE SALVADORAN BORDERS UNABLE TO ENTER THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

   MEANWHILE, AT LEAST TWO BOMBS PLACED NEAR ELECTRIC POWER POLES WERE
DETONATED THIS MORNING IN SAN SALVADOR.  ONE WAS PLACED AT 16 WEST STREET IN
THE IVU NEIGHBORHOOD, IN THE SOUTHERN AREA OF THE CAPITAL, AND A
FRAGMENTATION GRENADE EXPLODED NEAR THE SANTA ISABEL NEIGHBORHOOD.  A
TELEPHONE JUNCTION BOX, THE EXACT LOCATION OF WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN
DETERMINED, WAS ALSO DESTROYED.

   MILITARY SECURITY HAS BEEN STEPPED UP THROUGHOUT THIS CAPITAL AND ITS
OUTSKIRTS ONLY 24 HOURS BEFORE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  OFFICIAL SOURCES
THIS MORNING REPORTED THAT ARMED FORCES TROOPS ARE MAINLY PATROLING SAN
SALVADOR GAS STATIONS, SINCE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] URBAN COMMANDS HAVE THREATENED TO DESTROY THEM.

   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS ARE OVERFLYING
THE CAPITAL TO PROTECT VEHICLES THAT ARE TRANSITTING THE MAIN STREETS OF SAN
SALVADOR, DESPITE THE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE DECREED BY THE INSURGENCY 3
DAYS AGO.  REPORTS ALSO STATE THAT THE NATIONAL AND TREASURY POLICE ARE
OFFERING FREE TRANSPORTATION TO PEOPLE HEADING FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE WORK
PLACES.

   THE ARMY IS USING LOUDSPEAKERS ON MILITARY VEHICLES TO URGE THE PEOPLE TO
VOTE IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS TOMORROW.  FOR SUNDAY'S ELECTIONS, THE ARMY
WILL DEPLOY A LARGE NUMBER OF UNITS TO TRANSPORT VOTERS, WHO WILL BE GOING
TO THEIR RESPECTIVE POLLING PLACES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, POLICE-MILITARY SECURITY HAS BEEN STEPPED UP
LESS THAN 24 BEFORE THE 1989 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  WE HAVE NOTICED A
LARGER NUMBER OF SECURITY PERSONNEL NEAR THE SEVEN VOTING CENTERS THE
CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL HAS SET UP IN SAN SALVADOR MUNICIPALITY.  

   IN THE OUTLYING CITIES OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, SUCH AS MEXICANOS,
CUSCATANCINGO, AND APOPA, TRANSPORTATION IS STILL COMPLETELY PARALYZED IN
THE WAKE OF THE GROUND TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE DECREED BY THE FMLN, WHICH IS
IN ITS 3D DAY TODAY.

   MEANWHILE, REPORTS FROM CHALATENANGO, 72 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, STATE
THAT THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT IS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY DUE TO RATIONING THAT THE
CEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] HAS IMPOSED ON
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AFTER FMLN GUERRILLAS CARRIED OUT LARGE-SCALE SABOTAGE
OPERATIONS AGAINST THE ELECTRICITY NETWORK EARLY THIS WEEK.

   MILITARY SOURCES CONSULTED THIS MORNING IN CHALATENANGO SAID THAT THERE
HAVE BEEN NO CLASHES BETWEEN MILITARY FORCES AND GUERRILLAS IN THAT AREA FOR
THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THESE SOURCES SAID THAT THE VOTING BOOTHS THAT WILL BE
INSTALLED IN 33 MUNICIPALITIES OF THAT NORTHERN DEPARTMENT ARE READY.  THEY
ADDED THAT THE NUMBER OF MILITARY UNITS IN THAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN
INCREASED.

SIGNIFICANTLY CURBED HIS CRITICISMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, BUT HAS
STEPPED UP HIS ATTACKS ON THE CHILEAN OPPOSITION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TEMPORARY EMBARGO THAT THE UNITED STATES LEVIED ON CHILEAN FRUIT EXPORTS.  

   "THE DUTY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE
POPULATION OF THEIR COUNTRY," PINOCHET SAID, IN MARKED CONTRAST TO HIS
STATEMENTS A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

   THE CHILEAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE CALLED THE EMBARGO THAT THE UNITED STATES
LEVIED ON CHILEAN GRAPES AFTER CYANIDE WAS FOUND IN SUCH GRAPES IN
PHILADELPHIA "A SERIOUS MEASURE."  THE EMBARGO WAS PARTIALLY LIFTED
YESTERDAY.

   PINOCHET SAID THAT THE ANTI-U.S. REACTIONS IN CHILE WERE "UNFAIR" AND
REAFFIRMED THAT "THE DUTY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE
POPULATION OF THEIR COUNTRY."

   THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT ALSO HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION, ESPECIALLY
THOSE "WHO ARE UNDERHANDEDLY ACTING AGAINST OUR COUNTRY," CALLING THEM
"TURNCOATS."

   PINOCHET ASKED:  "HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE GONE TO THE UNITED STATES TO BEG,
TO WHINE, AND TO SPREAD TALES IN ORDER TO STOP LOANS TO US?  HAS EVERYONE
FORGOTTEN THAT THERE IS A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS BEEN ASKING THE UNITED STATES
NOT TO GIVE US ANY MORE LOANS?"

   THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT ADMITTED THAT "THE UNITED STATES HAD BEEN ATTACKED"
BECAUSE "THEIR INITIAL MEASURE WAS HASTY.  IT AMOUNTED TO USING A TANK TO
KILL A FLEA.  IT WAS A HARSH MEASURE WHICH HAD THE IMMEDIATE RESULT OF
STOPPING OUR SHIPMENTS OF FRUIT ABROAD."

   PINOCHET EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT TO BLAME,

   EL PARAISO (EL SALVADOR), 19 MAR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
ALEXANDER MENDEZ, COMMANDER OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, THE MAIN GARRISON
IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, HAS TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT OVER 500
GUERRILLA FIGHTERS ATTACKED TWO TOWNS IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT HOURS
BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS STARTED.

   ACCORDING TO THE OFFICER, THE CLASHES, WHICH BEGAN AT 2200 LAST NIGHT AND
ENDED AT 0500 TODAY, RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF SEVEN REBELS AND ONE SOLDIER
NEAR THE TOWNS OF TEJUTLA AND SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES.  ALEXANDER MENDEZ SAID
AT THE EL PARAISO GARRISON THAT THE HIGH NUMBER OF GUERRILLA FIGHTERS
INCLUDED "ATTACKERS AND OTHERS WHO PROVIDE COOPERATION AND CARE FOR THE
WOUNDED."

   THE OFFICER REPORTED 17 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING 9 WOUNDED SOLDIERS.

   A PEASANT WOMAN DIED WHEN A BOMB EXPLODED IN HER KITCHEN DURING THE
ATTACK ON SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES.  THE EXPLOSION ALSO BLEW OFF HER SONS'
LEGS, THE MILITARY COMMANDER SAID.

   MENDEZ STATED THAT FIVE HOUSES WERE DESTROYED DURING THE ATTACK ON SAN
MIGUEL DE MERCEDES, 7 KM FROM THE CAPITAL OF CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.

   THE SALVADORAN OFFICER CONFIRMED THAT THREE U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS HAD
TRAVELED TO CHALATENANGO TO HELP COUNTER THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE.

   ACAN-EFE WAS ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT ONE OF THE OFFICERS INCLUDED A U.S.
AIR FORCE COLONEL, WHO WAS WEARING FATIGUES AND CARRYING AN AR-15 RIFLE ON
HIS SHOULDER.

   MENDEZ ASSERTED THAT THERE ARE USUALLY FOUR U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS AT THE
4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, AND ADDED THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO CARRY WEAPONS LIKE
THE AR-15 "WHENEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE IT," ALTHOUGH THEY MAY NOT
PARTICIPATE IN OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS.

   THE CLASHES CAUSED PANIC AMONG PEOPLE IN CHALATENANGO WHO COULD HEAR THE
HEAVY FIRING BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY SHORTLY AFTER
THE VOTING TABLES OPENED.

   ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN OFFICER, LAST NIGHT'S GUERRILLA ATTACK IS
"ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE LATEST OFFENSIVE" LAUNCHED BY THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN SEPTEMBER.

   MENDEZ SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT WITH NUMEROUS
WEAPONS.  HE EMPHASIZED THE USE OF THE NEW AK-M RIFLES, "A NEW VERSION OF
THE FAMOUS GDR-MADE AK-47."

WITH COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF OPERATIONS OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMY GENERAL STAFF, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [EXCERPTS] [BEGIN
RECORDING] [PONCE] [WORDS INDISTINCT] HERE IN EL SALVADOR IF THEY
WANTED TO ESTABLISH A MECHANISM [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO SLOWLY ESTABLISH
PEACE IN THE ENTIRE REGION.  THOSE ARE THE EFFORTS [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO ABOUT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]?

   [PONCE] WE CAN ASK THEM TO JOIN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC, CIVIC LIFE TO
[WORDS INDISTINCT] PEOPLE TO LIVE IN PEACE.

   [REPORTER] HOW DO YOU VIEW THE VOTING SITUATION AND THE SECURITY AND
SURVEILLANCE THE ARMED FORCES IS PROVIDING, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE ARMED
FORCES ARE BEING CHARGED WITH THE DEATH OF TWO JOURNALISTS?  I THINK YOU ARE
AWARE OF THAT.  TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

   [PONCE] WE ARE THE FIRST ONES TO REGRET THE DEATH OF THE CANAL DOCE
NEWSMEN WHO DIED IN SAN MIGUEL AND THE REUTER CORRESPONDENT WHO DIED HERE ON
ARMY BOULEVARD.  THOSE DEATHS ARE THE RESULT OF THE PREVAILING UNREST AND
NERVOUSNESS.  THERE ARE BULLETS BEING FIRED ALL OVER THE PLACE AND,
UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE REPORTERS WERE THE FIRST TO GET HIT.  THIS CONTINUES TO
BE A PROBLEM THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAS [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] DID THE ARMY SUFFER CASUALTIES DURING THE INCIDENTS IN SAN
RAMON?

   [PONCE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT A BRACAMONTE BATTALION CORPORAL DIED AND
ANOTHER SOLDIER WAS WOUNDED.  HOWEVER, THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE AND
BRACAMONTE BATTALION SOLDIERS REACTED QUICKLY AND REPELLED THE TERRORIST
ACTIVITY THAT IS CURRENTLY CAUSING CHAOS IN SAN SALVADOR.  

   [REPORTER] HAVE OTHER INCIDENTS BEEN REPORTED?

   [PONCE] IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE WHAT THE FMLN IS SAYING. THEIR
SPOKESMAN IN MEXICO CITY SAID THEY WOULD NOT ATTACK THE VOTING TABLES.
HOWEVER, WE HAVE HEARD THAT VOTING TABLES HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN 15 AREAS OF
THE COUNTRY.  ATTACKS ON VOTING TABLES WERE REPORTED IN CHALATENANGO, SAN
ANTONIO, CIUDAD BARRIOS, CAROLINA, AND NORTH [WORD INDISTINCT].  IN
USULUTAN, THE FMLN PLANTED TWO BOMBS JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY TO FRIGHTEN THE
PEOPLE.  HOWEVER, OUR PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC NATURE IS TELLING THE FMLN:  WE DO
NOT WANT TERRORISM, WE WANT PEACE, AND WE ARE USING PEACEFUL MEANS TO
ACHIEVE POWER AND CHOOSE OUR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT.

   [REPORTER] HOW IS THE VOTING PROCESS PROGRESSING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY?

   [PONCE] THERE ARE 27 MUNICIPALITIES WHERE ELECTIONS ARE NOT BEING HELD.
WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT THERE ARE MUNICIPALITIES, LIKE CINQUERA AND ARAMBALA,
WHERE [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE KNOW
THERE ARE 27 MUNICIPALITIES WHERE THERE WILL BE NO VOTING AND THERE ARE
OTHERS THAT [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE POLITICAL
PARTIES AND MEMBERS OF THE MUNICIPAL VOTING TABLE BOARDS [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY SOLDIERS ARE PROTECTING THE VOTING TABLE BOARDS
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY?

   [PONCE] ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF OUR SOLDIERS ARE PART OF THE DEMOCRACY PLAN.
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE OFFERING THE SAME PROTECTION AFTER THE VOTING
CENTERS ARE CLOSED [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WE HAVE READ SOME REPORTS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE URGING THE
PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC].  WILL THE SOLDIERS
BE ALLOWED TO VOTE?

   [PONCE] FIRST, I EMPHATICALLY AND CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT WE ARE URGING
THE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE PDC.  WE HAVE SENT A MEMORANDUM TO ALL THE
COMMANDERS AND [WORD INDISTINCT] CHIEFS ADVISING THEM THAT WE MUST HAVE A
COMPLETELY APOLITICAL ATTITUDE AND REFRAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN ANY
POLITICAL ACTIVITY.  WE MUST PROTECT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, WE MUST PROTECT
ALL THE VOTING CENTERS, AND WE MUST ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE AREAS
SURROUNDING THE VOTING CENTERS.  WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WHO WINS THE
ELECTIONS; WE ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS
RESPECTED AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THIS IS A DAY FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
TO PROVE THEIR DEMOCRATIC NATURE.

   [REPORTER] WILL SOLDIERS BE ALLOWED TO CAST THEIR VOTES TODAY?

   [PONCE] AS SOLDIERS WE ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE.  BUT BEFORE WE CAST
OUR VOTE WE ARE GOING TO FULFILL OUR DUTY.  OUR DUTY IS TO GUARANTEE
SAFETY.  THIS WILL NOT CREATE A PROBLEM.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SOLDIER'S
IDENTIFICATION CARD WAS ISSUED IN SAN SALVADOR BUT HE IS STATIONED IN
AGUILARES, HE WILL BE ALLOWED TO VOTE AT A SPECIFIC VOTING CENTER.  THOSE
WHO CAN VOTE WILL DO SO AS CIVILIANS AND THEY WILL BE UNARMED.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] MOSTLY ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL AND [WORD INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE REBELS HAVE THREATENED TO LAUNCH A
LARGE ATTACK.  DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH MEN TO FIGHT THEM AT THIS TIME?

   [PONCE] SINCE 1982, WE HAVE [WORDS INDISTINCT] DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE
COUNTRY.  THE PEOPLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTIONS.
[WORDS INDISTINCT] AMID SABOTAGE TO THE POWER SYSTEM.  WE ARE ALSO
EXPERIENCING A WATER PROBLEM [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE ARE GOING TO EXERCISE

   HAVANA (CUBA), 20 MAR 89 (TASS) -- [TEXT] JOSE RICARDO PERDOMO,
CHAIRMAN OF THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL OF EL SALVADOR, ANNOUNCED
THE END OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY IN A TELEPHONE
INTERVIEW WITH TASS.  THE COUNTING OF VOTES IN SUNDAY'S ELECTION IN
THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN OBSERVERS WAS IN PROGRESS, AND PRELIMINARY
RESULTS WOULD BE DECLARED LATER ON MONDAY.  POLITICAL OBSERVERS
BELIEVE THAT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, CANDIDATE OF THE RIGHT-WING
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, HAS WON.

   STAFF MEMBERS OF THE [CENTRAL ELECTORAL] COUNCIL NOTED IN AN INTERVIEW
WITH [TASS] THAT VOTING BEGAN SLOWLY IN THE MORNING.  A TOTAL OF 1,835,000
VOTERS WERE REGISTERED IN THE COUNTRY WITH A POPULATION OF FIVE MILLION.
ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES OF JOURNALISTS IN SAN SALVADOR, THE PERCENTAGE OF
SALVADOREANS WHO ABSTAINED FROM VOTING WAS HIGHER THIS TIME THAN AT THE 1984
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHICH WAS WON BY JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, CANDIDATE OF
THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

   CONSTANT ARMED CLASHES BETWEEN DETACHMENTS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND ARMY UNITS INTERFERED WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION.  ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTION, THE INSURGENT RADIO STATIONS
[VENCEREMOS AND FARABUNDO] MARTI BROADCAST REPORTS THAT GUERILLAS WOULD NOT
ATTACK POLLING STATIONS.  INSURGENTS ATTACKED MILITARY GARRISONS IN MORER
THAN 20 INHABITED LOCALITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ON SUNDAY, PUTTING OUT
OF ACTION SOME 150 GOVERNMENT TROOPS.  GUERILLAS ALSO DOWNED A HELICOPTER
GUNSHIP IN USULUTAN REGION.  AS A RESULT OF INSURGENT ACTIONS, A
CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE COUNTRY REMAINS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY OR TELEPHONE
COMMUNICATION.  THE INSURGENT OPERATION TO BLOCK HIGHWAYS AND RAILWAYS
CONTINUES.

   [VIDES] CASANOVA, SALVADOREAN MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND PUBLIC SECURITY,
ADMITTED THAT THE ELECTION DID NOT TAKE PLACE IN 29 OUT OF 262 DISTRICTS IN
THE COUNTRY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ARMY COULD NOT RESTORE CONTROL OVER
THOSE TERRITORIES.

   APART FROM MOTOR VEHICLES WITH TROOPS AND MILITARY PARTOLS, ONLY TAXIS
WITH JOURNALISTS COVERING THE VOTING DROVE IN SAN SALVADOR ON THE ELECTION
DAY.  PRESS CARS HAD WHITE HANDKERCHIEFS FIXED TO AERIALS.  THIS PRECAUTION
WAS TAKEN AFTER MILITARY PATROLS KILLED THREE JOURNALISTS:  ROBNERTO
NAVAS, A REUTER NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER, CORONEL LAGROW, A DUTCH TV
CORRESPONDENT, AND MAURICIO PINEDA, A STAFF MEMBER OF SALVADOREAN
TELEVISION.  LUIS GALDAMEZ, ANOTHER REUTER CORRESPONDENT, WAS SERIOUSLY
WOUNDED, AND HIS ARM WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE AMPUTATED.

   CLANDESTINE, 21 MAR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] THE
DAY OF FIGHTING THAT RESULTED IN ENORMOUS ABSTENTION DURING THE 19
MARCH ELECTIONS REPRESENTED AN OVERWHELMING VICTORY FOR THE PEOPLE.
THIS WAS A FIGHTER'S WAY OF REPUDIATING THE WAR ELECTIONS THAT WERE
HELD AFTER THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] PEACE
PROPOSAL WAS BLOCKED.  IT ALSO REPRESENTED A DEFEAT FOR THE REAGAN
ADMINISTRATION, WHICH WAS BENT ON CARRYING OUT A DEADLY WAR AGAINST
OUR PEOPLE DISGUISED AS A HYPOCRITICAL CENTRIST AND FALSELY DEMOCRATIC
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.

   WE STRUGGLE FOR A JUST AND NEGOTIATED PEACE WITH GENUINE DEMOCRACY,
SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, AND WE GAVE A WORLD-RESOUNDING
BLOW TO THE ENEMIES OF PEACE.  THE THOUSANDS OF FMLN FIGHTERS WHO FOUGHT
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, CITIES AND INTERIOR, ENCOURAGED BY AN UNPRECEDENTED
INTENSITY AND SIMULTANEITY; THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNION MEMBERS,
PEASANTS, STUDENTS, TEACHERS, DISPLACED PERSONS, UNEMPLOYED PERSONS,
GOVERNMENT AND MUNICIPAL WORKERS, MOTHERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF POLITICAL
PRISONERS AND MISSING PERSONS, MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS,
BELIEVERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE CHURCHES WHO TOOK TO THE STREET
TO DEMAND THAT THE FMLN PEACE PROPOSAL BE ACCEPTED AND WHO LATER
REPUDIATED THE 19 MARCH WARMONGERING ELECTIONS; THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF CITIZENS, MORE THAN 1 MILLION PERSONS WITH VALID VOTING CARDS, WHO
REFUSED TO VOTE, AND THE MORE THAN 200,000 WHO CAST A VOID OR BLANK
BALLOT--SOMETHING THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL, THE NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA], AND THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] ARE
TRYING TO HIDE; THE TENS OF THOUSANDS WHO VOTED FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
CONVERGENCE; AND THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WHO WERE NOT INTERESTED IN
GETTING THEIR VOTING CARD THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE
DISCREDITED ELECTIONS ARE THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
WHO SAID NO TO THE COUNTERINSURGENCY WAR AND YES TO A JUST POLITICAL AND
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL CONFLICT.  YES TO A REAL DEMOCRACY; NO
TO THE TRADITIONAL LIE OF A VOTE THAT ONLY SERVES TO JUSTIFY AND
FACILITATE U.S. MILITARY AID, WHICH PROMOTES THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR
AND WORSENS THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF POVERTY, MISERY, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND
REPRESSION BEING EXPERIENCED BY OUR PEOPLE.

   THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS WERE HELD, BUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
SALVADORANS WHO LIVE ABROAD WERE KEPT FROM VOTING.  MANY OF THESE PEOPLE
FLED THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING PERSECUTED OR BECAUSE THE ARMED
FORCES FORCED THEM TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES THROUGH THEIR BOMBINGS AND OTHER
ATROCITIES.  THEY ARE ACTIVE SALVADORANS.  THANKS TO THEIR WORK, HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER SALVADORANS, MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILIES WHO HAVE
REMAINED IN EL SALVADOR, CAN SURVIVE.  HOWEVER, THESE PEOPLE WERE DENIED
THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE, A RIGHT THE FMLN PROPOSAL TO TURN THE ELECTIONS INTO
A MECHANISM FOR PEACE WOULD HAVE GRANTED THEM.

   MR ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS DECLARED HIMSELF THE WINNER IN AN ELECTION THAT
SAW THE LARGEST ABSTENTION IN THESE YEARS OF WAR.  MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DID NOT VOTE OR CAST VOID AND BLANK VOTES.  THE VOTES
CRISTIANI GOT DO NOT TOTAL 20 PERCENT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  MANY OF
THOSE WHO VOTED FOR CRISTIANI WERE DECEIVED BY ARENA'S PROPAGANDA THAT
PROMISED EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, EDUCATION, SCHOOLS, PUBLIC HEALTH, ECONOMIC
RECOVERY AND PROSPERITY, ETC.  CRISTIANI AND ARENA KNOW THEY ARE GETTING A
COUNTRY DROWNING IN AN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CRISIS, WITH A GROWING
REVOLUTIONARY WAR, AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE PROMISES.  NO ONE
CAN DO ANYTHING WITHOUT FIRST ACHIEVING A JUST PEACE.  FOR ALL THESE
REASONS, ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ELECTION CANNOT BE CONSIDERED EITHER MORALLY OR
POLITICALLY LEGITIMATE.  [CONTINUED]

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 21 MAR 89 (BARRICADA) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] FAR
FROM ACHIEVING A TRUCE THE DAY THE RECENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WERE
HELD, A GENERAL INCREASE IN VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WAS
THE RESULT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES AND THE
MILITARY HAVE SUBMERGED EL SALVADOR FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS.  ON THE ONE
HAND THERE WAS THE MILITARIZATION OF THE ELECTIONS THEMSELVES AND THE
INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING AND MACHINEGUNNING OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION,
WHICH LEFT A TOLL OF HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS AS WELL AS THREE NEWSMEN
MURDERED BY ARMY MEMBERS.  ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WERE MILITARY
ACTIONS BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN],
WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INFLICTED 150 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY AND
BROUGHT 90 PERCENT OF TRAFFIC TO A STANDSTILL.

   THE VOTING STATISTICS PAINT A SIMILAR PICTURE:  IN 29 OF THE 262
MUNICIPALITIES IN WHICH THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED, THERE WAS NO VOTING AT ALL.
OF THE 2.2 MILLION SALVADORANS WHO SHOULD BE ON THE VOTING LISTS, ONLY 1.8
MILLION WERE REGISTERED, AND WHILE 60 PERCENT OF THE VOTERS SHOWED UP AT THE
POLLS FOR THE 1984 ELECTIONS, THIS FIGURE WAS COMPLETELY INVERTED THIS PAST
19 MARCH.

   TODAY -- JUST LIKE BEFORE THE BALLOTING BEGAN -- PEACE, DEMOCRACY, AND
SOCIAL HARMONY IN EL SALVADOR [WILL NOT BE REACHED] AS LONG AS THE
UNITED STATES AND THE ARMY CONTINUE TO USURP THE POWER FORMALLY REPRESENTED
BY A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT, AND ANY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS -- IN ADDITION TO
YIELDING ANOTHER FARCE SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT HAS JUST BEEN STAGED -- WILL
ONLY RESULT IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF VIOLENCE THAT MIGHT EXTEND EVEN FURTHER AND
REACH EVEN BLOODIER PROPORTIONS.

   IF, ON THE CONTRARY, THOSE WHO REALLY HOLD POWER WERE INTERESTED IN A
NEGOTIATED, PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, THEY WOULD AT
LEAST BE TAKING THE FIRST SERIOUS STEPS TO MEET WITH THE OTHER BELLIGERENT
FORCE:  THE FMLN.

   FOR THE TIME BEING, HOWEVER, THE NEW ELECTORAL FARCE HAS ACCOMPLISHED
NOTHING BUT TO PROVIDE OVERWHELMING PROOF THAT IT IS ENTIRELY UNVIABLE AND
INEFFECTIVE.

[REPORT] [PETER KIRSCHEY] [TEXT] HIS NAME STANDS AT THE TOP OF THE HIT
LIST OF THE COLOMBIAN DEATH SQUAD: OSCAR DUENAS, MEMBER OF THE
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) AND CITY COUNSELOR OF
TUNJA, NORTH OF THE CAPITAL OF BOGOTA.

   IN A TALK DURING HIS VISIT TO BERLIN THIS WEEK, HE EMPHASIZED THE
DRAMATIC SITUATION IN HIS HOME COUNTRY.  IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN
UNPRECEDENTED ANNIHILATION CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS AIMED MAINLY AT FUNCTIONARIES
AND OFFICIALS OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION -- A MOVEMENT THAT INCLUDES COMMUNIST,
LEFT-WING, AND OTHER DEMOCRATIC FORCES.  MORE THAN 800 UP POLITICIANS HAVE
ALREADY HAD TO PAY FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR A DEMOCRATIC COLOMBIA WITH THEIR
LIVES, OSCAR DUENAS NOTED.  

   THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOT SAID THAT THE ALL-POWERFUL NARCOTICS MAFIA, IN
ALLIANCE WITH THE LARGE LANDOWNERS, RIGHT-WING MILITARY, AND PARTS OF THE
OLIGARCHY ARE BEHIND ALL THESE ATTACKS.  THEY FEAR FOR THEIR POWER AND ARE
PREPARED TO USE ANY MEANS TO PRESERVE IT.

   FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCE, OSCAR DUENAS REPORTED HOW THE DEATH SQUAD
PERSECUTES ITS OPPONENTS.  A GROUP WHICH CALLS ITSELF "RAMBO" HAS WAYLAID
HIM SEVERAL TIMES.  HOWEVER, UP TO NOW HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WARNED IN TIME.
THERE IS ALWAYS THE DANGER OF HIS BEING SHOT AT FROM A WINDOW, A PASSING
CAR, OR FROM BEHIND A BUSH.  THIS IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HIM -- AND
OTHER UP POLITICIANS -- WITH BODYGUARDS AROUND THE CLOCK.  "EVEN THOUGH THIS
MEANS A PERMANENT THREAT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT!" OSCAR DUENAS AFFIRMED.

   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION, THE CITY COUNSELOR
OF TUNJA SEES AN OPPORTUNITY IF THE GOVERNMENT COOPERATES WITH ALL DEMOCRATS
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST GANG TERRORISM AND DOES NOT TRY TO SPLIT UP THE
MOVEMENT OF THE LEFT.

CACERES PROVINCE, SAN MARTIN DEPARTMENT, WAS ATTACKED BY ARMED
NARCOTERRORISTS.

   THE GROUP WAS MADE UP OF APPROXIMATELY 300 MALE MEMBERS OF THE SHINING

HUNDRED PRISONERS HAVE SUCCEEDED IN EVADING THE SURVEILLANCE OF THE
ARMED PRISONERS WHO ARE INSIDE PAVON PRISON.  AFTER OVERCOMING A
SERIES OF OBSTACLES AND RISKING THEIR LIVES, 100 PRISONERS ESCAPED
FROM WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SHUT IN AND WENT TO PAVON PRISON'S
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY.  ONCE THEY ARRIVED, THE
PRISONERS ASKED PRISON AUTHORITIES TO TRANSFER THEM ELSEWHERE.

   AFTER THE PRISONERS WERE PROPERLY IDENTIFIED AT THE PRISON WARDEN'S
OFFICE, THEY WERE TAKEN TO A ZONE 18 PENITENTIARY IN GUATEMALA CITY.  

   WE REPEAT:  ONE HUNDRED PRISONERS ESCAPED AND SOUGHT PROTECTION FROM THE
AUTHORITIES, WHO IMMEDIATELY SENT THEM TO A PENITENTIARY IN ZONE 18 FOR
THEIR PROTECTION.

   ACCORDING TO THE PRISONERS, THE RIOTERS CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THEIR
POSITION THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST FULFILL ALL THEIR DEMANDS.  THE RIOTING
PRISONERS SHOT AT THE ESCAPEES, THUS FRIGHTENING THE CHILDREN AND THE
ELDERLY WHO REMAIN INSIDE THE PRISON.

FORCES INTELLIGENCE CORPS YESTERDAY THWARTED "OPERATION SUMMER 89,"
WHICH WAS A SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY [EPS] PLAN TO SABOTAGE AND PILLAGE
TOWNS ON THE HONDURAS-NICARAGUA BORDER.

   A MILITARY SOURCE MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, ADDING THAT 15 DAYS AGO, AN EPS
BATTALION STATIONED IN SOMOTO WAS DEPLOYED TO THE EASTERN PART OF HONDURAS,
AND ENROUTE THEY WERE JOINED BY 300 MEN WHO WERE INSTRUCTED TO WEAR U.S.
ARMY AND CONTRA UNIFORMS.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, OF THE 300 MEN, 50 ENTERED HONDURAN TOWNS, AMONG
THEM ALAUCA, SAMAYARES, OROPOLI, AND SANTA MARIA, WHERE THEY CARRIED OUT
SABOTAGE AND PILLAGE IN THE HOPE THAT RESIDENTS WOULD BLAME THE CONTRAS AND
RETALIATE AGAINST THEM.

   MOREOVER, HE ADDED, FIVE MEN HAD THE AUDACITY TO ENTER THE 6TH INFANTRY
BATALLION'S POSITIONS IN OJO DE AGUA TO MAKE A SKETCH OF THE 110TH INFANTRY
BRIGADE BATALLION'S EXACT LOCATION AND ESTABLISH THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF
HONDURAN TROOPS IN THAT SECTOR.  

   THE SOURCE SAID THE SANDINISTS WHO ENTERED HONDURAN TERRITORY USED BOOBY
TRAPS TO CARRY OUT THEIR ACTIONS, AND WERE EQUIPPED WITH ASSAULT WEAPONS,
RPG'S, AND AK-47 MACHINEGUNS.  

   TO CONCLUDE, THE SOURCE SAID "OPERATION SUMMER 89" WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN
YESTERDAY, 30 MARCH, BUT THE ARMED FORCES ARE CONSTANTLY ON ALERT TO AVOID
ANY WRONGFUL ACTIONS AND TO GUARANTEE NATIONAL INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY.

   CLANDESTINE, 6 APR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] THE FUTURE ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT IS ILLEGAL BECAUSE THE
RESULTS OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTION, MORE SO THAN IN ANY OTHER PAST
ELECTION, DO NOT REPRESENT THE WISHES OF THE MAJORITY OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THOSE ELECTIONS WERE MARKED BY ABSTENTION AS A
RESULT OF THE REJECTION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] PEACE PROPOSAL.  THOSE ELECTIONS WERE HELD WHILE THERE
WAS A WAR AND WHILE THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED.  THIS CLEARLY SHOWED THE
DUALITY OF POWER THAT EXISTS.  THIS CLEARLY SHOWED THAT THE MAJORITY
OF THE PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE WAR.  WITHOUT
NEGOTIATION, NO ONE CAN RULE IN EL SALVADOR.  THEREFORE, A MILITARY
SOLUTION OR THE SURRENDER OF THE FMLN IS NOT POSSIBLE.  THE FUTURE
GOVERNMENT HAS TWO OPTIONS: TO BE A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL INCREASE THE
WAR OR TO BE A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL MOVE TOWARD PEACE.

   THE FMLN JOINS ALL THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES THAT EXPRESSED
THEIR CONCERN FOR ARENA'S COMING TO POWER.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN ITS [WORD
INDISTINCT] CAMPAIGN IN WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS
MODERATES.  IN LESS THAN 20 DAYS, AND WITHOUT FORMALLY ASSUMING POWER, THERE
HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION AND SOCIAL TENSION, AS HAS BEEN EXPRESSED
IN DOZENS OF MISSING PERSONS, MURDERS, AND ARRESTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
LABOR UNION OFFICES AND THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS HAVE BEEN CORDONED
OFF; CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS; GRENADES AND BOMBS
HAVE BEEN EXPLODED IN PUBLIC PLACES; AND THE FMLN IS BLAMED FOR THOSE
ATTACKS.  JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN MURDERED; THERE HAS BEEN A SYSTEMATIC
INTIMIDATION OF THE PRESS AND ATTEMPTS TO CURB FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; AND
MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS LINKED TO ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON HAVE BEEN RELEASED
FROM PRISON.  THERE HAVE BEEN THREATS OF SEIZING LAND THAT BELONGS TO
COOPERATIVES; THERE HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT THE BANKING SYSTEM AND
FOREIGN TRADE WILL BE PRIVATIZED AND THAT MANY GOVERNMENT WORKERS WILL BE
FIRED.  THERE IS A CLIMATE OF TERROR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THIS CLIMATE
OF TERROR IS THE RESULT OF THE ARROGANCE AND THE DESIRE FOR REVENGE ON THE
PART OF ARENA AND SECTORS OF THE ARMED FORCES.  ARENA HAS CLEARLY STATED
THAT IT WILL HAVE A POLICY OF KILLINGS AND TOTAL WARFARE AND HAS GIVEN NO
SIGN OF WANTING PEACE.

   IT IS URGENT THAT AN ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK FOR DIALOGUE BE CREATED.  THIS
MEANS ARENA MUST:

   1.  CEASE ALL KILLINGS, ARRESTS, DISAPPEARANCES, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS ON
CIVILIANS; IT MUST RESPECT THE PRESS AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PUT AN
END TO MILITARIZATION OF WORKPLACES, MILITARY CORDONS, AND ALL REPRESSIVE
ACTIONS PERPETRATED BY THE ARMED FORCES AND THE DEATH SQUADS.

   2.  ARENA MUST RESPECT THE NATIONALIZATION OF BANKS, FOREIGN TRADE, AND
AGRARIAN REFORM.  IT MUST ENSURE THAT COOPERATIVES' PROPERTY WILL BE
RESPECTED; THAT THERE WILL BE NO APPROPRIATION HEARINGS INVOLVING PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BENEFITED FROM AGRARIAN REFORM; AND THAT THERE WILL BE NO ECONOMIC
MEASURES AIMED AT FORCING THOSE PEOPLE INTO BANKRUPTCY OR INTO SELLING THEIR
LAND.  LIKEWISE, ARENA MUST PROMISE THAT THERE WILL BE NO MASS DISMISSALS OF
GOVERNMENT WORKERS.

   3.  ARENA MUST PROMISE A REAL DIALOGUE AND NOT A USELESS DIALOGUE AIMED
AT BRINGING ABOUT THE FMLN'S SURRENDER.  ARENA, AND THE SECTORS IT
REPRESENTS, HAS AND ALWAYS HAS HAD REAL POWER.  THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL
THAT HAPPENS IN THE COUNTRY.  THEY CANNOT CLAIM, AS SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE AND THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE CLAIMED, A LACK
OF AUTHORITY TO CONTROL REPRESSION OR A LACK OF POWER TO NEGOTIATE.

   ARENA HAS ECONOMIC, JUDICIAL, AND LEGISLATIVE POWER AND IT HAS EVEN
SEIZED POWER IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.  ARENA HAS ITS OWN PARAMILITARY
FORCES, DEATH SQUADS, AND CONTROLS AN IMPORTANT SECTOR OF THE ARMED FORCES.

PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA SAAVEDRA TODAY CRITICIZED THE RATIFICATION OF
A BILATERAL MILITARY AID AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
HONDURAS BECAUSE, HE SAID, IT DEALS A BLOW TO THE PEACE AGREEMENT
SIGNED IN EL SALVADOR IN FEBRUARY.

   AT THAT MEETING, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ASKED GOVERNMENTS BOTH
IN AND OUTSIDE THE REGION THAT OPENLY OR COVERTLY PROVIDE AID TO
UNCONVENTIONAL FORCES TO IMMEDIATELY HALT THEIR AID.

   ON 29 MARCH, THE U.S. AND HONDURAN GOVERNMENTS RATIFIED THE ADDITIONAL
PROTOCOL OF A BILATERAL MILITARY AID AGREEMENT.

   THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT MADE THESE REMARKS DURING TODAY'S INAUGURATION
OF A HYDROELECTRICAL PROJECT IN ASTURIAS, JINOTEGA, NORTHERN NICARAGUA, THAT
WILL SAVE THE COUNTRY APPROXIMATELY 200,000 BARRELS OF OIL EVERY YEAR.

   ORTEGA SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES CANNOT CRITICIZE THE ARMS BUILDUP IN
THE REGION WHILE IT PROMOTES MILITARY MANEUVERS AND BRINGS WEAPONRY INTO
CENTRAL AMERICA, PARTICULARLY INTO HONDURAS.  

   THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS IN HONDURAS HEIGHTENS
TENSION IN THE REGION AND DEALS A BLOW TO THE EL SALVADOR AGREEMENT.

   THE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT INAUGURATED TODAY IS LOCATED IN APANAS LAKE,
JINOTEGA DEPARTMENT.  IT WILL SEND ELECTRIC POWER TO THE CENTRAL AMERICA AND
CARLOS FONSECA PLANTS, WHICH TOGETHER WILL PRODUCE OVER 4 MILLION KILOWATTS
OF ELECTRICITY AN HOUR.

[BAYARDO] ARCE HAS DECRIBED THE OPPOSITION'S TRIP TO GUATEMALA AS A
"BLUNDER" AND SAID THAT IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE IF THE POLITICAL
PARTIES WENT TO THAT MEETING TO LOOK FOR A "LEADER" TO CONFRONT THE
SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FSLN] FROM AMONG THOSE
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY CHIEFTAINS.

   ARCE, A MEMBER OF THE [FSLN NATIONAL] DIRECTORATE, INSISTED THAT THE
OPPOSITION'S MEETING WITH THE MERCENARIES IS A "BLUNDER" FROM ANY POINT OF
VIEW SINCE WHICHEVER PARTY DECIDES TO BE THE UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION FOR ALL
THESE GROUPS WILL NOT GAIN ANY PRESTIGE.

   NONETHELESS, HE SAID THE BEST THING WOULD BE FOR THE CONTRAS TO FIND OUT
WHO WILL BE THE STEPPING STONE FOR THEM TO ENTER THE COUNTRY, INASMUCH AS IT
IS A DEFEATED MERCENARY FORCE THAT HAS BEEN UNMASKED AS DEPENDENT ON THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT.

   "I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE NERVE TO SAY THAT THEY ARE NOW A
POLITICAL PARTY, AND THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO WILL BE THEIR
STEPPING STONE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO JOIN THE CIVIC STRUGGLE NOW THAT THE THE
WAR OPTION HAS BEEN DEFEATED," HE ADDED.

   THE SANDINIST LEADER INSISTED THAT IF THE OPPOSITION GOES TO GUATEMALA TO
LOOK FOR A "LEADER" TO CONFRONT THE [FSLN] IN THE ELECTIONS, THIS WILL
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE POLITICAL PARTIES ARE WEAK.

   HE ADDED THE CONTRA CHIEFTAINS DO NOT HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS TO BECOME
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SINCE THEY ARE MORE CRIMINAL THAN THE
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES THEMSELVES WHO CARRY OUT AMBUSHES, WHILE THEIR
CHEIFTAINS SIT IN LUXURY HOTELS IN TEGUCIGALPA, SAN JOSE, MIAMI, AND
WASHINGTON ENCOURAGING THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.

    WHEN ASKED ABOUT FSLN ACTIVITIES FOR THE NEXT ELECTION CAMPAIGN, ARCE
SAID THAT HIS PARTY IS NOT OUT PREPARING FOR ELECTIONS BUT IS CONTINUING TO
WORK TOWARD THE FULFILLMENT OF ALL THE TASKS THAT THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE ARE
CARRYING OUT, PARTICULARLY THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE AND FOR THE ECONOMY.

   WE WILL PREPARE OUR FORCES FOR THE FEBRUARY 1990 ELECTIONS, BUT FIRST WE
HAVE THE TASKS AHEAD FOR CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REVOLUTION,
HE ADDED.

   THE COMMITTEE THAT WILL ORGANIZE THE CELEBRATIONS WILL BE ANNOUNCED ON 19
APRIL.

   [COMMANDER] ARCE SAID THAT THE NEXT ELECTION CAMPAIGN MIGHT BE MORE
"INTERESTING" IF THE PARTIES THAT BELIEVED THAT THE [REAGAN] ADMINISTRATION
WOULD DEFEAT THE REVOLUTION MILITARILY AND ABSTAINED FROM THE 1984 ELECTION
WOULD DECIDE TO JOIN THE CIVIC STRUGGLE.

   DUE TO THE PEACE EFFORTS OF THE REVOLUTION, EVEN THE CONTRAS COULD
PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS, AND WE WILL FIND OUT WHO'S WHO AND EACH PARTY
WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE, THE
SANDINIST LEADER SAID.

FORMER ECUADORAN PRESIDENT LEON FEBRES CORDERO AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAS
TAKEN PLACE IN GUAYAQUIL WITHOUT MAJOR INCIDENT BECAUSE THE SMALL
GROUP OF DEMONSTRATORS WAS CONTROLLED BY MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL
POLICE POSTED ALONG 9 OCTOBER AVENUE, THE SITE OF THE DISTURBANCE.
FORMER PRESIDENT LEON FEBRES CORDERO, HIS WIFE, AND SEVERAL OF HIS
CLOSE SUPPORTERS MARCHED DOWN THE PORT CITY'S MAIN AVENUE FOR A FEW
MINUTES AND THEN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS FROM HIS NEIGHBORS, WENT TO HIS
HOUSE.  THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS CLOSE FRIENDS HAVE REMAINED
INSIDE THE HOUSE SINCE 1705.

   THE DISTURBANCES IN GUAYAQUIL RESULTED IN TWO INJURIES.  ONE OF THE
INJURED PERSONS IS 1ST COMPANY POLICEMAN LUIS CASTRO ROMAN, WHO HAS BEEN
ADMITTED TO LUIS VERNAZA HOSPITAL.  POLICEMAN CASTRO ROMAN WAS SHOT BY ONE
OF THE DEMONSTRATORS.  THE BULLET LODGED IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS CHEST.
THE BLOODY INCIDENT OCCURRED ON BOYACA AND 9 OCTOBER AVENUES.  ALSO INJURED
DURING THE DEMONSTRATION WAS A CITIZEN WHO HAS NOT BEEN INDENTIFIED.

   SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE REPORTED THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE
DID NOT USE FIREARMS DURING THE DEMONSTRATION.  LEON FEBRES CORDERO'S MARCH
IN GUAYAQUIL BEGAN AT 1600 WITH A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PERSONS.  THE GROUP
GATHERED ON BOYACA AND 9 OCTOBER AVENUES.  THE DEMONSTRATORS BEGAN THEIR
MARCH BUT WERE IMMEDIATELY CONTROLLED BY THE POLICE WITH THE USE OF TEAR GAS
AND WATER.  FEBRES CORDERO'S WIFE WAS ALSO PRESENT ON 9 OCTOBER AVENUE; SHE
WALKED A SHORT DISTANCE TO MEET HER HUSBAND.  THEY THEN LEFT THE AREA WHERE
THE DISTURBANCE TOOK PLACE.

   IN CONCLUSION, THE DEMONSTRATION PLANNED BY THE SOCIAL CHRISTIANS AND

NICARAGUANS WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY.  IT IS UP TO THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT
TO INSTITUTE DEMOCRACY IN NICARAGUA, WHICH WILL ENSURE AN AUTOMATIC END TO

   SOFIA (BULGARIA), 12 APR 89 (RABOTNICHESKO DELO) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
MANUEL CEPEDA, MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA, BY DETELIN SERTOV,
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RABOTNICHESKO DELO EDITORIAL BOARD] [TEXT]
[SERTOV] POLITICAL LIFE IN COLOMBIA IS STILL LINKED WITH VIOLENCE.....

   [CEPEDA] COLOMBIA IS EXPERIENCING AN EXTREMELY SEVERE POLITICAL AND
INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS, CAUSED BY THE INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE FAST
DEVELOPING PRODUCTIVE FORCES AND THE EXISTING POLITICAL SETUP.  FOR EXAMPLE,
LAST YEAR COLOMBIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS 4.5 PERCENT.  HOWEVER, POLITICAL
LIFE CONTINUES TO BE DOMINATED BY THE TWO OLD PARTIES -- THE LIBERALS AND
THE CONSERVATIVES, WHO MAINTAIN A MERELY FORMAL DEMOCRACY.  WE SHOULD NOT
FORGET COLOMBIA'S STRATEGIC POSITION:  IT FORMS A BRIDGE BETWEEN CENTRAL AND
SOUTH AMERICA.  ALL EVENTS IN COLOMBIA AFFECT THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  

   PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THIS, THE SO-CALLED "SANTA FE-2" DOCUMENT, DRAWN UP
BY EXTREME RIGHT-WING U.S. POLITICIANS, CONTAINS A PLAN TO APPLY PRESSURE IN
COLOMBIA AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, TO EXPAND THE SO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY
CONFLICT, ONE OF WHOSE MANIFESTATIONS IS THE SO-CALLED "DIRTY WAR" IN THE
COUNTRY.

   ACCORDINGLY, THE VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA IS CAUSED BY BOTH INTERNAL FACTORS
-- THE CRISIS OF THE INSTITUTIONS -- AND EXTERNAL ONES, NAMELY THE POLICIES
OF THE MOST REACTIONARY CIRCLES IN THE UNITED STATES.

   [SERTOV] CAN ONE EXPECT THE PEACE SETTLEMENT TO BE FULFILLED UNDER THESE
CONDITIONS?

   [CEPEDA] THIS IS THE AIM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA [PCC].  AT
OUR RECENT 15TH CONGRESS, WE MADE A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION AND
CONCLUDED THAT THE CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA MUST BE SETTLED BY POLITICAL MEANS.
THE PCC RAISED THE QUESTION OF REMOVING THE SIEGE SITUATION THAT, WITH A FEW
INTERRUPTIONS, HAS BEEN MAINTAINED FOR SEVERAL DECADES, AND OF DISBANDING
THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS (ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS,
ABOUT 140 SUCH GROUPS ARE OPERATING).  THESE GROUPS OWE THEIR VERY EXISTENCE
TO THE SUPPORT GIVEN BY MILITARY CIRCLES AND THE CLAN CHIEFS TO THE TRADE IN
NARCOTICS.  (I WILL ADD IN PARENTHESES THAT THIS IS THE REASON FOR THE USE
OF THE TERM "NARCOMILITARISM" IN COLOMBIA.) ONE OF THE PCC'S DEMANDS IS THAT
THE ARMY SHOULD BE PURGED OF FASCIST ELEMENTS AND THAT A CIVILIAN SHOULD BE
PUT IN CHARGE OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.  THE PARTY ALSO RAISED THE
QUESTION OF MAKING A START ON THE NECESSARY DEMOCRATIC REFORMS, BUT THE
GOVERNMENT PAYS NO HEED TO OUR DEMANDS.

   THE GOVERNMENT RECENTLY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH "M-19," ONE OF THE
PARTISAN GROUPINGS IN THE COUNTRY, BUT DID NOT ACCEPT ANY COMMITMENTS IN
PRACTICE.  ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE SOME DOUBTS OVER HOW THE LIVES OF THE
PARTISAN LEADERS WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY GUARANTEED.  THE LARGEST PARTISAN
GROUP -- THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA -- IS DEMANDING THAT THE
GOVERNMENT TAKE SERIOUS STEPS TO LIMIT THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS, IN ORDER TO
CONCLUDE A TRUCE.

   [SERTOV] CLEARLY, IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN COLOMBIA.

   [CEPEDA] AT THE MOMENT, PEACE SUPPORTERS IN COLOMBIA ARE FORMING 
A BROAD FRONT, WHICH IN PRACTICE HAS AN ANTIFASCIST ORIENTATION.  PEACE
DEPENDS ON HOW FAR THIS FRONT WILL SUCCEED IN EXPANDING, HOW THE
CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF REGARDING THE PARAMILITARY
GROUPS WILL DEEPEN, AND ON WHETHER WE WILL SUCCEED IN ISOLATING THEM.  WE
ARE OPTIMISTS, BUT ALSO HAVE A GREAT NEED OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY.

   [SERTOV] HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE POLITICAL PROSPECTS FOR THE UNITED LEFT IN
YOUR COUNTRY?

   [CEPEDA] THE LEFT FORCES IN COLOMBIA ARE UNITED IN THE PATRIOTIC UNION
THAT WAS CREATED 4 YEARS AGO.  ITS AIM IS TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
IN OUR COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, THE UNION IMMEDIATELY BECAME A TARGET OF THE
ORGANIZERS OF THE "DIRTY WAR." HUNDREDS OF ITS LEADERS WERE BEATEN UP, MANY
OF WHOM WERE PCC MEMBERS.  SO FAR, OVER 1,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED, INCLUDING
JAIME PARDO LEAL, LEADER OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN JOSE
ANTEGUERA, AND OTHERS.  THREATS CONTINUE TO BE MADE AGAINST THE UNION AND
AGAINST THE PCC.  ALL MEMBERS OF THE PCC LEADERSHIP HAVE RECEIVED DEATH
THREATS.  THE SAME ALSO APPLIES TO BERNARDO JARAMILLO, THE PRESENT LEADER OF
THE UNION, GILBERTO VIEIRA, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PCC CENTRAL COMMITTEE,
AND OTHERS.

   ON 27 FEBRUARY COMRADE FORERO [NAME AS TRANSLITERATED], PCC SECRETARY FOR
ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS, WAS KILLED.  HIS WIFE AND COMRADES SOTELO AND
SOTOMAYOR ALSO DIED IN THE ATROCITY.  NEXT DAY, WE HAD A MEETING WITH
VIRGILIO BARCO, PRESIDENT OF COLOMBIA.  HE PROMISES TO TAKE SPEEDY MEASURES
AGAINST THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  HOWEVER, ONLY 4 DAYS LATER, ANTEGUERA, THE
FORMER LEADER OF THE UNION OF COMMUNIST YOUTH, WAS KILLED AT BOGOTA
AIRPORT.  SENATOR ERNESTO PISANO, ONE OF THE LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATES FOR
THE PRESIDENCY, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED AT THE SAME TIME.  MANY MEMBERS OF THE
MILITARY WERE PRESENT AT THE AIRPORT ON THAT DAY, AS WELL AS THE POLICE CHIEF
OF THE CAPITAL, YET ONLY ONE OF THE MURDERERS WAS KILLED, WHILE THE REST
ESCAPED.  THIS IS WHY WE TOLD PRESIDENT BARCO THAT WE HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS
ABOUT THE ARMY'S ROLE IN THIS ASSASSINATION.  

   NEXT YEAR, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND ELECTIONS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODIES
ARE DUE TO TAKE PLACE IN COLOMBIA.  THE PCC AND THE PATRIOTIC UNION WANT TO
TAKE PART IN THEM, BUT WE HAVE WARNED THE LEADERS OF THE REPUBLIC THAT
UNLESS THE "DIRTY WAR" IS ENDED, WE WILL EXPOSE THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA TO
THE WORLD AND REGARD THE ELECTION RESULTS AS ILLEGAL.  DESPITE EVERYTHING,
WE CONSIDER THAT THE PATRIOTIC UNION HAS A PROMISING FUTURE, BECAUSE ITS
AIMS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.

PRESIDENT BARCO VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED COLOMBIA'S IMAGE REGARDING ITS
STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, AND COMMON CRIME IN A
SPEECH HE GAVE IN WASHINGTON THIS MORNING.  HE POINTED TO THE
ERADICATION OF ILLITERACY, COMMENTED ON THE NATION'S ECONOMIC INDEXES,
AND SAID THAT COUNTLESS COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED IN THEIR
STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   PRESIDENT BARCO INVITED OTHER AREA COUNTRIES TO JOIN EFFORTS TO END DRUG
CULTIVATION, TRAFFICKING, AND CONSUMPTION.  COLOMBIA CANNOT FIGHT THIS EVIL
ALONE, BARCO ASSERTED.  HE GAVE SPECIFIC STATISTICS ABOUT BLOWS THAT HAVE
BEEN STRUCK AGAINST COLOMBIAN DRUG CARTELS.  

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BARCO] I CAME TO MAKE AN APPEAL TO YOU.  LET US ALL
COMBINE OUR EFFORTS AND ENERGIES IN AN ALLIANCE THAT IS STRONGER AND BETTER
COORDINATED THAN THAT OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE NEED AN ALLIANCE OF
NATIONS AFFECTED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING IN ORDER TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY.  DRUG
TRAFFICKING IS NOT THE PROBLEM OF A SINGLE NATION, OR EVEN OF A GROUP OF
NATIONS.  IT IS A UNIVERSAL OUTRAGE.  UNLESS WE DEVISE STRONG AND EFFECTIVE
MEANS OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO FIGHT AGAINST ALL PHASES OF THE
PROBLEM, A FINAL VICTORY WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE.

   FOR THIS REASON, I WISH TO USE THIS FORUM TO MAKE A NEW PROPOSAL TO
REFLECT THE SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE ALL FEEL WITH REGARD TO THIS PROBLEM.
WE -- ALL PRESIDENTS OF THE AMERICAN HEMISPHERE, ALONG WITH PRESIDENT BUSH
AND OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES OF THOSE NATIONS MOST AFFECTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL
DRUG TRAFFICKING SCOURGE -- SHOULD MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO JOINTLY
EXERCISE THE PUBLIC, POLITICAL AUTHORITY CONFERRED UPON US BY THE WILL OF
OUR PEOPLE. [END RECORDING]

   THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT REITERATED HIS CONDEMNATION OF WEAPONS PRODUCTION
AND TRAFFICKING, HIGHLIGHTED COLOMBIA'S DEMOCRACY, AND SAID THAT HIS COUNTRY

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 APR 89 (TCS TELEVISION) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTERS] [TEXT] [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] YOU MENTIONED THE
ATTACK ON THE RESIDENCE OF VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO.  WE
WOULD LIKE YOU TO GIVE US SOME DETAILS ON THIS.

   [CRISTIANI] AT APPROXIMATELY 0530 THIS MORNING, THREE EXPLOSIVES WERE
HURLED AT HIS RESIDENCE FROM AN EMPTY LOT.  THE EXPLOSIVES CAUSED EXTENSIVE
DAMAGE TO THE RESIDENCE.  THERE WAS RIFLE FIRE TOO, BUT THE RIFLE FIRE WAS
ONLY TO DISTRACT SECURITY PERSONNEL IN THE AREA.

   THE ATTACKERS ACTED LIKE ANIMALS.  MR MERINO IS STILL IN THE UNITED
STATES WITH HIS WIFE.  HE WILL BE RETURNING THIS AFTERNOON.  THEIR FOUR
CHILDREN AND THREE OF THE CHILDREN'S FRIENDS WERE AT THE RESIDENCE WHEN THE
ATTACK TOOK PLACE.  THE CHILDREN COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.  THOSE WHO CARRIED
OUT THIS ATTACK ARE PEOPLE WHO FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
HUMAN RIGHTS AND ABOUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS.  THIS ATTACK ENDANGERED
CIVILIANS.  THANK GOODNESS ONLY ONE OF THE CHILDREN WAS WOUNDED.  ONE OF
THE GIRLS WHO WAS VISITING THE HOME WAS HIT BY SOME SHRAPNEL BUT THE WOUND
IS NOT SERIOUS.  RIGHT NOW WE ARE GETTING A DOCTOR TO EXAMINE THE CHILDREN
TO SEE IF THEIR HEARING HAS BEEN DAMAGED BECAUSE TWO OF THE DEVICES
EXPLODED IN THE BEDROOM THE CHILDREN WERE IN.

   I BELIEVE THIS IS ANOTHER INDICATION THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], FAR FROM SEEKING PEACE AND WANTING PEACE
FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WANTS TO CONTINUE ITS TERRORISM, ITS KILLINGS --
ITS IRRATIONAL KILLINGS.  I BELIEVE THAT LITTLE CAN BE ACHIEVED IN THE
SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH DIALOGUE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT SINCERE WHEN
THEY CLAIM THAT THEY WANT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF VIOLENCE.  THEY STATED THEIR OPINION
ON 19 MARCH.  THE FMLN SHOULD THINK CAREFULLY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE FLATLY
REJECTED VIOLENCE AND THE FMLN.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MEMBERS OF OUR
PARTY WILL BE FRIGHTENED INTO ABANDONING THE STRUGGLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION
OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS SOMETHING THE PEOPLE WANT.

   I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE THE FMLN LOOK LIKE MARTYRS AND LIKE
PERSONS WHO WORK FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE, SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH:  THEY
ARE NOTHING BUT SAVAGES WHO LACK HUMAN QUALITIES AND WHO ARE
INDISCRIMINATELY KILLING AND WOUNDING CIVILIANS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE CONFLICT.  [CONTINUED]

   TEGUCIGALPA, 16 APR 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [EXCERPT] ONE MAN WAS KILLED AND
ANOTHER SERIOUSLY INJURED THIS EVENING WHEN A POWERFUL EXPLOSIVE THEY WERE
ATTEMPTING TO HURL FROM A PASSING MOTORCYCLE AT A U.S. EMBASSY WAREHOUSE IN
TEGUCIGALPA EXPLODED BEFORE THEY COULD THROW IT.

   THE DEAD MAN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS 39-YEAR-OLD MIGUEL RODOLFO AGUILAR
FLORES OF TEGUCIGALPA.  HIS BODY WAS BLOWN TO BITS BY THE EXPLOSION.  

   THE WOUNDED MAN HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED.  HE WAS ADMITTED IN A
SEMICONSCIOUS STATE TO THE BURNS UNIT OF THE ESCUELA HOSPITAL.

   ACCORDING TO POLICE, THE BOMB WAS CHINESE-MADE AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN
DETONATED BY HEAT FROM THE MOTORCYCLE OR FROM FRICTION CREATED AS A RESULT
OF BEING PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN ON THE MOTORCYCLE.

   ANOTHER THEORY IS THAT THE TWO MEN DROPPED THE BOMB WHEN THEY TRIED TO
THROW IT AT THE WAREHOUSE, WHICH IS LOCATED 1 KM NORTHWEST OF THE U.S.
EMBASSY.  POLICE BELIEVE THAT THE BOMB WAS GOING TO BE PLACED IN THE U.S.
EMBASSY WAREHOUSE BY MEMBERS OF THE HONDURAN LEFT TO COMMEMMORATE WHAT
PEOPLE HERE CALL "BLACK APRIL" FOR THE UNITED STATES.

   ON 7 APRIL 1988, A MOB SET FIRE TO THE U.S. CONSULATE IN TEGUCIGALPA AND
TO 30 DIPLOMATIC VEHICLES.

   LIMA, 17 APR 89 (TELAM-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE POLICE HAVE ARRESTED JOSE
LUIS FRANCISCO GUTIERREZ, A COLOMBIAN CITIZEN, 28, WHO IS SUSPECTED OF
BEING A MEMBER OF THE COLOMBIAN M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP.

   GUTIERREZ WAS ARRESTED YESTERDAY WHILE TRAVELLING IN A CAR WITH PERUVIAN
ENGINEER MIGUEL RINCON RINCON IN WHOSE POSSESSION THE POLICE FOUND
SUBVERSIVE PROPAGANDA FROM THE OUTLAWED REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT TUPAC AMARU
(MRTA) OF PERU.  

   POLICE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AFFIRMED HAVE CONFIRMED THE ARREST OF THIS
COLOMBIAN CITIZEN AND SAID THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE MAY BE THE
LIASON BETWEEN THE M-19 AND THE MRTA.  TWO YEARS AGO, THESE GROUPS CREATED
THE NOW DISMANTLED "AMERICA BATTALLION," WHICH STATED SOME ARMED OPERATION
IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY.  

   THE ARREST OF JOSE LUIS FRANCISCO GUTIERREZ BRINGS TO THREE THE NUMBER OF
COLOMBIANS THAT HAVE BEEN SEIZED AND THAT ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE
ANTITERRORIST POLICE (DIRCOTE).  HENRY VLADIMIR DELGADO SALAZAR AND JOSE

   BOGOTA, 18 APRIL 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] MULTI-PARTY TALKS ON INCORPORATING
COLOMBIA'S M-19 REBEL GROUP INTO CIVILIAN LIFE WOUND UP TUESDAY WITH
AGREEMENT THAT THE PROCESS MUST BE COMPLETED BY JUNE 30.

   REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT, POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE M- 19 GROUP,
WHICH ACCEPTED A TRUCE LAST MONTH AFTER 16 YEARS OF FIGHTING, REACHED THE
ACCORD AT A "WORKING SESSION" AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.

   NO OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE WAS RELEASED, BUT SOURCES CLOSE TO THE TALKS SAID
THE PARTIES HAD AGREED TO CONTINUE BI-WEEKLY PARLEYS AND TO CREATE A GENERAL
SECRETARIAT COMPRISING REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH OF THE DELEGATIONS.

   THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS NAMED AS GUARANTOR OF ANY FINAL AGREEMENT.

   THE GUERRILLA GROUP SIGNED ITS TRUCE MARCH 18 UNDER A PEACE PLAN
ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO HAS SAID REBEL
LEADERS WOULD BE PARDONED.

   THE TALKS HAVE YET TO BROACH THE THORNY SUBJECT OF THE 2,500- STRONG
GROUP'S HANDING OVER ITS ARMS.

   THE GUERRILLA GROUP WAS FORMED IN SEPTEMBER 1973 AS A PROTEST AGAINST
WHAT IT SAID WAS ELECTORAL FRAUD COMMITTED BY THEN- STRONGMAN GUSTAVO ROJAS
PINILLA.  ITS ORIGINAL MEMBERS WERE DISSIDENT GUERRILLAS FROM OTHER GROUPS,
PROFESSIONALS, WORKERS, STUDENTS AND FORMER SOLDIERS.

   IN JANUARY 1974, THE REBEL GROUP MADE HEADLINES BY STEALING A SWORD THAT
HAD BELONGED TO SIMON BOLIVAR -- WHO LED THE WARS OF INDEPENDENCE IN MOST OF
NORTHERN SOUTH AMERICA -- WHICH THEY PROMISED TO USE TO "REDEEM" THE COUNTRY.

   M-19'S MOST SPECTACULAR OPERATION WAS ITS 1985 TAKEOVER OF THE PALACE OF
JUSTICE IN BOGOTA. IN THE MILITARY OPERATION TO RETAKE THE BUILDING, MORE
THAN 100 PEOPLE DIED, INCLUDING SIX TOP JUDGES AS WELL AS VISITORS,
EMPLOYEES AND REBELS.

   THE REBELS WERE REPORTEDLY HIRED BY DRUG KINGPINS TO STORM THE BUILDING
AND DESTROY DOCUMENTS TO BE USED IN PROCEEDINGS TO EXTRADITE THE DRUG LORDS
TO THE UNITED STATES.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 19 APR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] HONDURAN GUERRILLAS CLAIMED
CREDIT TODAY FOR THE ATTACK ON A U.S. ARMY CONVOY ON 11 APRIL IN NORTHERN
HONDURAS IN WHICH ONE PERSON WAS KILLED, THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE WOUNDED, AND
ONE VEHICLE DESTROYED.

   THE ATTACK ON AN 11-VEHICLE CONVOY CARRYING U.S. AND HONDURAN SOLDIERS
TOOK PLACE 17 KM NORTHEAST OF OLANCHITO, IN YORO DEPARTMENT, ON THE NORTHERN
COAST OF HONDURAS.  

   PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT U.S. AND HONDURAN TROOPS ARE BUILDING A
HIGHWAY FOR MILITARY EMERGENCIES AND CIVIL DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE DISTRIBUTED IN OLANCHITO, THE MORAZANIST PATRIOTIC FRONT
(FPM) CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE ATTACK, AND SAID THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY
THE RAMON AMAYA AMADOR COMMANDO GROUP [COMANDO RAMON AMAYA AMADOR].

   THE GUERRILLA COMMUNIQUE STATED "THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT WITH RIFLE
FIRE AND HAND GRENADES, WHICH NEUTRALIZED THE REARGUARD OF THE YANKEE CONVOY
AND RESULTED IN ONE DEAD, THREE OR FOUR WOUNDED, AND ONE DESTROYED VEHICLE."

   THE COMMUNIQUE ADDED THAT "THE YANKEES REFUSE TO REPORT THEIR CASUALTIES
SO AS NOT TO DEMORALIZE THEIR TROOPS.  OUR RIFLES WILL BE AIMED AT THE
BLONDS FROM THE NORTH WHO ARE TODAY TRAMPLING ON OUR SACRED FATHERLAND."

   THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND THE U.S. EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA HAVE
CONFIRMED THE ATTACK, BUT THEY DID NOT MENTION ANY CASUALTIES, ALTHOUGH THEY
ADMIT THAT THE LAST VEHICLE IN THE CONVOY WAS "DAMAGED" BY AN EXPLOSIVE
DEVICE THAT WAS HURLED AT IT.

   ON 1 FEBRUARY, ANOTHER U.S. MILITARY CONVOY WAS ATTACKED IN THE SAME AREA
BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS, WITHOUT CAUSING ANY CASUALTIES BUT DAMAGING ONE
TRUCK.

   THAT ATTACK WAS ALSO CLAIMED BY THE FPM, WHICH SAID IT HAD WOUNDED SOME
AMERICANS.

   THE FPM FIRST APPEARED IN SAN PEDRO SULA IN 1979 AND HAS TAKEN CREDIT FOR
SEVERAL DYNAMITE ATTACKS AND RURAL GUERRILLA ACTIONS.

   RAMON AMAYA AMADOR, THE NAME USED BY THE HONDURAN GUERRILLA GROUP, WAS A
LEFTIST NOVELIST WHO WROTE ABOUT THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES AMONG
HONDURANS.  HE ALSO CONDEMNED FOREIGN INTERVENTION, PARTICULARLY U.S.
INTERVENTION, IN HONDURAN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL AFFAIRS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 APR 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A SELF-NAMED ULTRA-RIGHT-WING
COMMANDO UNIT, THE "GERARDO BARRIOS CIVIC FORCE" [FUERZA CIVICA GERARDO
BARRIOS] TONIGHT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DYNAMITE ATTACK THAT KILLED
SALVADORAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA TODAY.  

   IN TELEPHONE CALLS TO LOCAL RADIO STATIONS, THE COMMANDO UNIT STATED:
"WE WERE BORN THROUGH ANTISUBVERSIVE COMBAT; HOWEVER, WE ARE AN ESSENTIALLY
DEMOCRATIC FORCE, BECAUSE WE HAVE COME TO CONFRONT THE MONOPOLIZING AND
TOTALITARIAN EFFORTS OF ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE],
WHICH WILL BE THE RULING PARTY AS OF 1 JUNE."

   THE NEW "DEATH SQUAD" SPOKESMAN SAID:  "WE ARE CONFRONTING THE WORTHLESS
(VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT) MERINO AND (ARENA LEADER) D'AUBUISSON.  WE RECENTLY
GAVE THEM A DISSUASIVE SIGNAL, AND TODAY WE GAVE THEM A SECOND ONE..."

   LAST WEEK FRANCISCO MERINO'S RESIDENCE WAS THE TARGET OF A BOMB ATTACK,
THOUGH THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES [AS RECEIVED].

   "WE ARE AGAINST EVERY ACT OF INTRIGUE AND CONSPIRACY WITHIN THE ARMED
FORCES AND CURRENT ACTS OF REPRESSION BY THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS,
AS WELL AS ALL ACTIONS AGAINST DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRACY."

   IN CONCLUSION, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS A VEILED THREAT AGAINST FRANCISCO
GUERRERO, PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, WHO IS CHARGED WITH A
"FIFTH COLUMN ACTION."

   THIS IS THE SECOND "DEATH SQUAD" THAT HAS MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN THE
COUNTRY IN LESS THAN A WEEK.

   ON 14 APRIL, SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK ON MERINO, THE SELF-STYLED
"GUARDIANS OF FREE ENTERPRISE" MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND HARSHLY CRITICIZED
THE CHIEFS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY WHO "OBEY PRESSURES FROM ABROAD."

MORE" DURING AN ATTACK ON A MILITARY CONVOY IN NORTHERN YORO DEPARTMENT ON
11 APRIL.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO LOCAL RADIO STATIONS, THE MORAZANIST PATRIOTIC

HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING MANEUVERS IN THE NORTHERN REGION, WITH RIFLE FIRE AND
GRENADES, MANAGING TO "NEUTRALIZE THE YANKEE CONVOY'S REARGUARD, KILLING ONE
SOLDIER AND WOUNDING THREE OR FOUR.

   HOWEVER, SPOKESPERSONS FOR THE ARMED FORCES PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTORATE
TODAY REITERATED THAT ONLY MATERIAL DAMAGE WAS REPORTED IN THE ATTACK
AGAINST THE MILITARY CONVOY.

   THE MORAZANIST FRONT ALSO SAID THAT ON 1 FEBRUARY, IN ANOTHER ATTACK
CARRIED OUT IN YORO DEPARTMENT, IT INFLICTED CASUALTIES ON U.S. ARMY TROOPS.

   THIS CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION WAS CREATED IN THE MID-SEVENTIES, BUT ITS
OPERATIONS WITHIN HONDURAS ARE SPORADIC.

[TEXT] THREE OFFICIALS OF BRASPETRO [BRAZILIAN PETROLEUM CORPORATION
INTERNATIONAL, INC.] HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS FROM
THE MEDIO MAGDALENA PETROLEUM BASIN, IN COLOMBIA.

   THE GUERRILLAS LAST NIGHT ATTACKED THE OIL WELL ISLA TABACO I. THEY
CAUSED A LARGE FIRE AND ESCAPED, TAKING AS HOSTAGES BRAZILIAN ENGINEERS
PAULO CESAR PAIM DE OLIVEIRA, AUGUSTO CARNEIRO MOREIRA JUNIOR, AND JOSE

UNFOLDED OUR MILITARY MAP, ON WHICH WE HAVE PLACED A SMALL BLACK
CIRCLE AT EACH COMBAT SITE, A RED CIRCLE AT THE SITE OF EACH ACT OF
SABOTAGE, AND A GREEN CIRCLE FOR EACH AMBUSH OF MILITARY VEHICLES.
OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS, THE BLACK CIRCLES ON OUR MAP HAVE BEEN
CONCENTRATED IN SAN SALVADOR AND THE EASTERN REGION.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THE
MOST PROMINENT ACTION HAS BEEN THE ATTACK ON THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS IN
SAN SALVADOR'S DENSELY POPULATED SANTA ANITA NEIGHBORHOOD.  WE ARE
WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL WAR BULLETIN ON THAT ACTION.

   ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ATTACK IS THAT IT WAS
STAGED DESPITE THE ARMY'S PRESENCE IN THE HEART OF THE CAPITAL, AND IT
OCCURRED IN FULL DAYLIGHT.  AT NOON ON FRIDAY, A CONTINGENT OF URBAN
GUERRILLAS GOT WITHIN 50 METERS OF THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS AND LAUNCHED AN
ATTACK WITH RIFLES AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS. EVERY SHOT HIT ITS TARGET.  ARMED
FORCES PATROLS TRIED TO CUT OFF OUR FIGHTERS' RETREAT THROUGH THE STREETS OF
THE CAPITAL, BUT THE SOLDIERS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IN SAN SALVADOR, THE
PEOPLE THEMSELVES FORM A MOUNTAIN THAT PROVIDES COVER FOR OUR URBAN
GUERRILLAS.

   EARLY ON SATURDAY MORNING, WE AMBUSHED AN ARMY CONVOY ON THE PAN AMERICAN
HIGHWAY AT EL PUNTILLAL, YAPATZTEPEQUE, USING EIGHT EXPLOSIVE CHARGES.
THE AMBUSHED TROOPS WERE REINFORCED BY OTHER UNITS, WITH WHOM WE FOUGHT FOR
AN HOUR.  THIS AMBUSH WAS CARRIED OUT AGAINST ENEMY ARMORED UNITS.  THE
RESULT OF THIS ACTION WAS AN ESTIMATED 35 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING AN OFFICER
OF THE TECHUACAN BATTALION'S RECONDO UNIT AND A CAVALRY OFFICER.  FOR OUR
PART, WE REPORT THE HEROIC LOSS IN BATTLE OF OUR COMRADE JACKSON.

   PRAGUE (CZECHOSLOVAKIA), 21 APR 89 (RUDE PRAVO) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
MANUEL CEPEDA, MEMBER OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL
COMMITTEE POLITBURO, BY VERA POSLEDNI] [TEXT] RECENTLY COMRADE MANUEL
CEPEDA, MEMBER OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE
POLITBURO, VISITED CZECHOSLOVAKIA; WE ASKED HIM FOR AN INTERVIEW.

   [POSLEDNI] IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH, THREE
LEADING OFFICIALS OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE LEFTIST
COALITION, THE PATRIOTIC UNION (UP), COMRADES FORERO, SOTELO, AND ANTEQUERA,
WERE MURDERED IN COLOMBIA.  WHY?  

   [CEPEDA] IN COLOMBIA THE DIRTY WAR STEMMING FROM THE AMERICAN TACTICS OF
SO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY CONFLICT IS INTENSIFYING.  THE INTERNAL POLITICAL
CRISIS IS DEEPENED BY AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE POWERFUL DRUG SMUGGLING CLANS
AND THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP WHICH IS CONDUCTING THE DIRTY WAR.  IN THE SANTA
FE II DOCUMENT, FORMULATING FUTURE UNITED STATES POLICY IN LATIN AMERICA, IT
IS EVEN SAID THAT UNLESS THE UNITED STATES INTERVENES IN THE 1990'S COLOMBIA
WILL BECOME ANOTHER EL SALVADOR AND ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE.  THE SO-CALLED
EXTERMINATION OPERATION, ALSO KNOWN AS THE CONDOR PLAN, IS DIRECTED AGAINST
THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND UP, AGAINST THE UNIONS, BUT ALSO AGAINST PRIESTS WHO
PREACH LIBERATION THEOLOGY, AND RECENTLY THIS HAS INTENSIFIED.  IN COLOMBIA
SOME ELEMENTS OF FASCISM OPENLY MANIFEST THEMSELVES.  THIS IS MANIFESTED IN
HUGE AND UNPUNISHED MASSACRES AND IN THE POWERLESSNESS OF PRESIDENT BARCO
AND HIS CIVILIAN MINISTERS WHO ARE NOT MANAGING TO KEEP THE MILITARY
LEADERSHIP IN CHECK, ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT IS THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE
ARMED FORCES.

   [POSLEDNI] SOMETIMES PARTISANS ARE ALSO ACCUSED OF TERROR.  

   [CEPEDA] THAT IS ONE OF THE TRAITS OF AMERICAN POLICY -- TO TERM ANY
KIND OF REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE, OF STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY, AND THE
PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AS TERRORISM.  THEREFORE, IT ALSO LABELS THE SANDINISTAS
IN NICARAGUA AS TERRORISTS AND THE CONTRA REBELS AS FREEDOM FIGHTERS.  BY
THIS I DO NOT WANT TO SAY THAT THE PARTISANS DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES, WE ALSO
CRITICIZE THEM.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONDEMNED THE DESTRUCTION OF OIL PIPLINES
BY THE COLOMBIAN PARTISAN ORGANIZATION THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN).
WE DO NOT AGREE WITH KIDNAPPING CIVILIANS IN EXCHANGE FOR RANSOM.  WE
ANNOUNCED THAT, AS LONG AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO END THE CONFLICT, IT IS
NECESSARY TO HUMANIZE IT AND TO RESPECT HUMAN LIVES.  THESE ARE THE TACTICS
OF SOLDIERS -- TO LABEL THE PARTISANS AS TERRORISTS AND THEN MASSACRE THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION AS SUSPECTS WHO ARE COLLABORATING WITH TERRORISM.

   [POSLEDNI] PARTISANS FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA
(FARC) OFFERED THE GOVERNMENT A DIALOGUE ABOUT A TRUCE.  HOW DO THEY WANT TO
CONDUCT THIS?

   [CEPEDA] THE FARC, WHICH IS THE STRONGEST ELEMENT OF THE COLOMBIAN
PARTISAN MOVEMENT AND A MEMBER OF ITS COORDINATING COMMITTEE, UNILATERALLY
ADOPTED A CEASE-FIRE AND PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION FOR THIS
DIALOGUE.  IN IT ARE TWO FORMER PRESIDENTS, THE LIBERAL LOPEZ MICHELSEN AND
THE CONSERVATIVE PASTRANA, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDUSTRIALISTS
ECHEVERRI CORREA, AND BOGOTA'S CARDINAL REBOLLO.  THE FARC WANTS THE
GOVERNMENT TO DISBAND THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  THE FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER,
GAVIRIA, SAID THAT THERE ARE 140 OF THEM.  THIS MEANS THAT THE GOVERNMENT
KNOWS THEM.  THE FARC IS DEMANDING THE PURGE OF PEOPLE FROM THE ARMY COMMAND
INVOLVED IN THE DIRTY WAR, THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER BE A CIVILIAN, THAT THE
STATE OF EMERGENCY BE REVOKED, AND THAT THE ROAD TO REAL DEMOCRACY BE OPENED.

   [POSLEDNI] BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN NEGOTIATING WITH PARTISANS FROM
M-19.

   [CEPEDA] THE EL TIEMPO NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROMISED
THEM REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT BY THEIR INCLUSION AS CANDIDATES OF THE
LIBERAL PARTY.  THIS IS TO INVOLVE FOUR SEATS AS LONG AS M-19 LAYS DOWN ITS
ARMS AND DISBANDS.  THE OTHER PARTISANS BITTERLY CRITICIZED THIS AS A BLOW
AGAINST THE UNITY OF THE MOVEMENT WHICH WILL BE ABUSED FOR PROPAGANDA
PURPOSES.  AT THE SAME TIME, M-19 REPRESENTS ONLY 5 PERCENT OF THE
MOVEMENT.  IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO DIVIDE THE PARTISANS.

   [POSLEDNI] THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS TOOK PLACE IN
DECEMBER.  HOW DID IT REACT TO THE SITUATION?

   [CEPEDA] THE PARTY CALLED FOR PEACE AND OUTLINED THE STRUGGLE FOR A
PLURALIST GOVERNMENT OF TRANSITION TOWARDS PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  AT THE END
OF FEBRUARY THERE WAS A CENTRAL COMMITTEE SESSION WHICH DISCUSSED THE DIRTY
WAR.  IT STATED THAT, IN SPITE OF THE TERROR, THERE HAD NOT BEEN WHAT HAD
HAPPENED IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS IN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, NAMELY,
MASS EMIGRATION.  TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE, THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE DISCUSSED NEW MEASURES, INCLUDING THE TRANSITION OF PART
OF THE PARTY TO THE UNDERGROUND.  WE WILL NOT ALL TRANSFER, BECAUSE NOW WE
MUST STRUGGLE FOR OPEN CONTACT WITH THE MASSES, REGARDLESS OF THE HUGE RISK
WHICH IS LINKED TO THIS.

   [POSLEDNI] WHERE IS THE PARTY SEEKING ALLIES?  

   [CEPEDA] COMRADE ANTEQUERA, AS DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE UP, HAD ESTABLISHED
A NUMBER OF CONTACTS.  HOWEVER, HE WAS MURDERED, AND SENATOR SAMPER PISANO,
A POLITICIAN FROM THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED DURING THE
ASSASSINATION AT BOGOTA AIRPORT ON 3 MARCH.  THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
AGAINST THE 32-YEAR-OLD PROSPECTIVE POLITICIAN OCCURRED THE DAY AFTER HE
ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENCY.  HE ANNOUNCED HIS SUPPORT FOR
DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE, FOR AN END TO THE DIRTY WAR WHICH, AS HE SAID, IS
NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, HE WAS NOT A CHANCE
VICTIM.  IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT THAT THE CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION COVERING
THE AIRPORT, WHICH IS IN THE HANDS OF THE ARMY, WAS SWITCHED OFF.  THUS,
THEY WANTED TO PREVENT THE MURDERERS BEING FILMED.  ONE OF THEM DIED, THEY
LET THE OTHER THREE ESCAPE.  AT THE SAME TIME, BOGOTA'S CHIEF OF POLICE WAS
AT THE AIRPORT ALONG WITH ANOTHER 10 COLONELS AND A NUMBER OF POLICEMEN AND
PERSONAL BODYGUARDS.

   [POSLEDNI] HOW DID THE OTHER PARTIES REACT TO THE ASSASSINATION?

   [CEPEDA] A JOINT DOCUMENT WAS SIGNED BY THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST 
PARTY, THE UP, AND THE LIBERAL PARTY, ON WHOSE BEHALF THE FORMER PRESIDENT
TURBAY AYALA SIGNED.  IT DEMANDS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DISBAND THE
PARAMILITARY SQUADS.  IT SHOWS THAT OPINIONS ARE BEGINNING TO DIFFER, EVEN
IN THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY.  THE CONSERVATIVES ARE ALSO EMPHATICALLY
CRITICIZING THE BLOODBATH AND THE PASSIVITY OF THE GOVERNMENT, POINTING OUT
THAT THEIR LAST PRESIDENT, BETANCUR, CONDUCTED A DIALOGUE WITH THE
PARTISANS.  THIS IS ALL HAPPENING BEFORE THE ELECTIONS WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE
NEXT YEAR.

   [POSLEDNI] THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP MET WITH THE
PRESIDENT AFTER THE MURDER OF COMRADE FORERO.  WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

   [CEPEDA] IN THE CONVERSATION, WE POINTED TO THE FACT THAT THE DEFENSE
MINISTER, GENERAL GUERRERO PAZ, TRAVELS AROUND COLOMBIA ACCOMPANIED BY THE
LEADER OF THE ULTRA-RIGHT WING, RETIRED GENERAL LANDAZABAL REYES, WHO IS
LEADER OF THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  WE ASKED WHY THESE TWO ARE TOGETHER.
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ANSWER US.  AT THE MEETING WE ALSO SAID THAT, UNLESS
THE DIRTY WAR STOPS, THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
HISTORY WILL NOT TAKE PART IN THE ELECTIONS.  WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
PARTICIPATE, BECAUSE WE ARE ALL BEING MURDERED.  UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT GIVES
US A GUARANTEE OF SECURITY, WE WILL NOT SACRIFICE MORE LIVES.

   [POSLEDNI] THANK YOU FOR THE INTERVIEW.

GUATEMALA.  

   MILITARY SOURCES TOLD ACAN-EFE THE COLONEL WAS DRIVING HIS PRIVATE
VEHICLE FROM HUEHUETENANGO TO BARILLAS MUNICIPALITY THIS MORNING WHEN HE WAS
INTERCEPTED BY A GROUP OF HEAVILY ARMED, UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS.

   THE SOURCES ADDED THE OFFICER WAS SHOT SEVERAL TIMES AND THAT HIS
BODYGUARDS FOUGHT OFF THE ATTACKERS, WHO FLED INTO THE MOUNTAINS IN THE
REGION.

   IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE ALLEGED REBELS SUSTAINED ANY CASUALTIES.  THE
REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS, ONE OF THE FOUR GUERRILLA
GROUPS THAT COMPOSE THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, OPERATES IN
NORTHWESTERN GUATEMALA.

   CLANDESTINE, 25 APR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATEMENT] [COMMANDER
ROBERTO ROCA, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
GENERAL COMMAND] [EXCERPT] THE AMNESTY MENTIONED BY D'AUBUISSON
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE LEADER] IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE
REVIVAL OF SOMETHING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SOUNDLY DEFEATED.  THIS
PROPOSAL IS COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE CURRENT BALANCE OF FORCES
AND, AS WE MAY GATHER FROM HIS STATEMENTS, ESSENTIALLY REFLECTS THE
PLANS OF THE NEW ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT,
WHICH WILL BE IMPOSED ON 1 JUNE, TO INTENSIFY THE WAR.

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE READY TO FACE THE WARMONGERING MANEUVERS OF THE
TRUE REPRESENTATIVE OF ARENA DEATHS SQUADS WHO IS NOW TRYING TO CREATE A
TERRORIST STATE THROUGH NEW REPRESSIVE ACTIONS.  HOWEVER, SINCE ARENA WON
THE MARCH ELECTION FARCE, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY
AWARE OF THE NEED TO CONFRONT SUCH REPRESSIVE ACTIONS.

   ARENA HAS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER; IT IS OFFERING OLD AND FAILED TACTICS IN
THE FACE OF A NEW SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY; THAT IS, A SIGNFICANT CHANGE IN
THE BALANCE OF FORCES IN FAVOR OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] AND THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE.  THIS WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY ENCOURAGE A STRUGGLE AS SOON AS THE NEW ARENA GOVERNMENT IS
INSTALLED.

   D'AUBUISSON AND ARENA WILL SCARE NOBODY WITH PLANS THAT ARE COMPLETELY
DETACHED FROM A GENUINE WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  THE FMLN HAS
PRESENTED A PRUDENT PEACE PROPOSAL BASED ON AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE
CURRENT BALANCE OF FORCES.

   IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO REALIZE THAT THE DEGREE OF
UNITY REACHED TO FACE ARENA'S PLANS WILL BE THE KEY TO COUNTER THE
REPRESSION THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND ARENA ARE ALREADY PROMOTING.

   QUITO, 25 APR 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE INSURGENT GROUP ALFARO LIVES, DAMN
IT (AVC) TODAY REAFFIRMED THE SUSPENSION OF ITS ARMED ACTIVITIES AND BLAMED
EXTREME RIGHTIST GROUPS FOR SEVERAL ATTACKS AND ASSAULTS THAT HAVE TAKEN
PLACE IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS.  

   AVC SPOKESMAN PATRICIO LEON SAID THE AVC "IS A SERIOUS, RESPONSIBLE
ORGANIZATION.  WE HAVE PUT DOWN OUR WEAPONS; WE HAVE SUSPENDED ALL TYPES OF
ARMED ACTIVITIES."

   IN MID-JANUARY, THE AVC SIGNED AN UNCONDITIONAL AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT
RODRIGO BORJA'S ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH IT PLEDGED TO GIVE UP ITS ILLEGAL
ACTIVITIES AND REJOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE.

   HOWEVER, NEWS SOURCES BLAMED THE GROUP FOR 13 BANK ROBBERIES THAT HAVE
TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED AND FOR A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON A
POLICE CHIEF, THE HOME OF AN ARMY GENERAL, AND BODYGUARDS OF DEFENSE
MINISTER GENERAL JORGE FELIX.

   LEON SAID THAT THESE ACTIONS WERE INTENDED TO UNDERMINE THE AGREEMENT
WITH THE GOVERNMENT "BECAUSE THE EXTREME RIGHT WING WANTS TO BLAME THE AVC,
WHICH IS NOW ENGAGED IN DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES."

   THE AVC SPOKESMAN EMPHASIZED HIS CONVICTION THAT THERE ARE DEMOCRATIC
WAYS OF SOLVING THE NATION'S PROBLEMS.  HE DISCLOSED THAT IN THE PAST FEW
HOURS, THE AVC FORMED AN ORGANIZATION FOR POLITICAL DIALOGUE "SO THE
SOLUTIONS TO THOSE PROBLEMS WILL NOT REMAIN MERE GOOD INTENTIONS."

   PATRICIO LEON SAID THE AVC'S POLITICAL DIALOGUE ORGANIZATION WILL BEGIN
ITS ACTIVITIES BY SEEKING A CONSENSUS ON THE AMOUNT OF AN ANNOUNCED WAGE
INCREASE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT
DUARTE SAID THIS AFTERNOON THAT PRESIDENT- ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S
PEACE PROPOSAL DESERVES RESPECT AND THAT ONE MUST HOPE THAT IT WILL
PRODUCE RESULTS THAT WILL BENEFIT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE
PRESIDENT MADE THIS STATEMENT AT COMALPA AIRPORT UPON HIS RETURN FROM
THE UNITED STATES.  HE ADDED THAT HE WILL RESUME HIS DUTIES TOMORROW,
EVEN THOUGH HIS CANCER HAS GROWN.  THERE HAS BEEN VERY NEGATIVE
SPECULATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH, BUT HE STATED THAT HE WILL
RESUME HIS DUTIES IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] THE TESTS I UNDERWENT INDICATE THAT THE LIVER
CANCER HAS GROWN.  IT HAS NOT SPREAD BUT IT HAS GROWN, WHICH ADDS TO THE
RISK.  I UNDERWENT A 5-DAY TREATMENT, AND I WILL HAVE TO RETURN AS SOON AS I
PASS THE PRESIDENCY ON TO MY SUCCESSOR.  I WILL RETURN TO THE HOSPITAL ON 2
JUNE FOR ANOTHER CHECKUP AND TREATMENT.

   [REPORTER] WHEN WILL YOU RESUME YOUR DUTIES?  

   [DUARTE] IMMEDIATELY.  I AM THE PRESIDENT AND AS SOON AS I SET FOOT ON
SALVADORAN SOIL, I RESUME MY DUTIES. [END RECORDING] 

   IN REGARD TO THE SEARCHES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED AT VARIOUS UNION
HEADQUARTERS, DUARTE SAID HE WAS NOT FULLY AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN
WHICH THESE WERE CARRIED OUT.  HOWEVER, HE SAID THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS MUST
BE DEFENDED WHEN DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS TURN INTO LIBERTINISM.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] ONE MUST NOT CONFUSE THE FREEDOM OF ALL
SALVADORANS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES, HOLD DEMONSTRATIONS, JOIN UNIONS, AND
WORK FOR THEIR ASPIRATIONS WITH TERRORIST AND SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS THAT ATTACK
DEMOCRACY.  ONE MUST NOT CONFUSE THESE THINGS.  THIS IS ONE OF THE BASIC
POINTS I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE ALL SECTORS UNDERSTAND.  I HAVE BEEN CREATING
POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COUNTRY SO THAT GRADUALLY WE WILL LEARN TO
LIVE FREELY IN A DEMOCRACY WHILE RESPECTING ONE ANOTHER. [END RECORDING]

   ASKED ABOUT THE UNITED FRONT THAT ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]
IS PROMOTING IN THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT IF THIS
BENEFITS THE COUNTRY, IT DESERVES SUPPORT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A POLICY FOR PEACE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT -- IN OTHER WORDS, BY ME. I
HAVE PUBLICLY STATED THIS, AND I HAVE TRIED TO ACHIEVE PEACE THROUGH [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  IT WILL NOW BE UP TO ANOTHER PRESIDENT.  I HAVE TO SHOW
RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT-ELECT CRISTIANI, WHO MUST BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO
BEGIN HIS TERM IN AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH HE CAN PRESENT HIS IDEAS,
PROPOSALS, AND SOLUTIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO FIND THE PATH TO PEACE. [END
RECORDING]

   PRESIDENT DUARTE DID NOT COMMENT ON THE PEACE PROPOSAL THAT WAS RECENTLY
ANNOUNCED BY ARENA BECAUSE, HE SAID, HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT, ADDING
THAT IT WOULD BE UNETHICAL TO QUESTION THE PROPOSALS AND EFFORTS OF THE NEXT
PRESIDENT.  HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT ANY EFFORTS FOR PEACE MUST BE SUPPORTED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 APR 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT]
PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED CHANGES IN THE
ARMY'S STRATEGY TOWARD URBAN TERRORISM AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE TO ISOLATE THE
NEW GOVERNMENT ABROAD.

   CRISTIANI SAID: "WE MUST ADJUST OUR POLITICAL-MILITARY STRATEGY AND
MODIFY LAWS TO ALLOW US TO PROFESSIONALLY COUNTER THE FMLN'S STRATEGY."

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY MORNING, THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AND
MEMBER OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) PRESENTED THE BASIC
VIEWPOINTS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, WHICH WILL REPLACE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT
NAPOLEON DUARTE'S ADMINISTRATION ON 1 JUNE.

   AS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WAS MAKING THIS STATEMENT, HE LEARNED ABOUT THE
ASSASINATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO.  [SENTENCE AS
PUBLISHED] ALVARADO WAS KILLED BY A BOMB PRESUMABLY PLACED BY AN URBAN
GUERRILLA GROUP ON TOP OF HIS ARMORED VEHICLE AS IT STOPPED AT AN
INTERSECTION IN SAN MIGUELITO NEIGHBORHOOD, NORTH OF THE CAPITAL.

   THE FMLN IS ABANDONING "GUERRILLA WARFARE TACTICS IN RURAL AREAS AND
INCREASINGLY RESORTING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN FRONTS IN THE MAIN
CITIES AND TO URBAN TERRORISM IN AN ATTEMPT TO DESTABILIZE (THE
GOVERNMENT).  AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, THE GUERRILLAS ARE TRYING TO
ELICIT NEGATIVE REACTION TOWARD THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO ISOLATE US POLITICALLY
FROM THE WORLD," CRISTIANI SAID.  VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO
ACCOMPANIED HIM.

   HE ADDED: "OBVIOUSLY, IF WARRANTED BY THE SITUATION, WE MUST RESORT TO
LEGAL MECHANISMS.  SHOULD THE SITUATION BECOME DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO
CONTROL, OUR HARSHER MEASURE WOULD BE TO DECLARE A STATE OF SIEGE."

   SINCE EARLY APRIL, THE FMLN HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT A STRONG OFFENSIVE
AGAINST PRIVATE COMPANIES AND THE BANKING SYSTEM AND HAS STEPPED UP SABOTAGE
ACTIONS AGAINST TELEPHONE AND ELECTRICITY NETWORKS.

   IN ADDITION TO THE ATTACK ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THERE WERE OTHER
ATTACKS, IN WHICH GUERRILLA DESERTER MIGUEL CASTELLANOS AND FRANCISCO
PECORRINI, BOTH OF WHOM WERE RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGUES, WERE KILLED AND CARLOS
MENDOZA, CHIEF EDITOR OF ANALISIS MAGAZINE, WAS WOUNDED.  CASTELLANOS AND
PECORRINI WERE CONNECTED WITH THAT MAGAZINE.

COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, HAS DISCLOSED A REBEL PLAN TO DESTABILIZE THE
COUNTRY THROUGH STREET VIOLENCE.  COL PONCE SAID MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
UNCOVERED THE PLAN, WHICH INVOLVES SEVERAL UNIONS AND MASS
ORGANIZATIONS.  ACCORDING TO COL PONCE, THERE WILL BE VIOLENT ACTIONS
IN THREE DEPARTMENTS: SAN SALVADOR, SANTA ANA, AND SAN MIGUEL.  THE
UNTS [NATIONAL UNITY OF SALVADORAN UNIONS], THE UNIVERSITY OF EL
SALVADOR, THE MPTL [BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND LIBERTY MOVEMENT], AND A
[WORD INDISTINCT] SHOCK GROUP, WILL LEAD THE ACTIONS.

   PONCE SAID HE IS REVEALING THIS TO KEEP THESE ACTIONS FROM TAKING PLACE.
HOWEVER, HE SAID, IF THEY ARE CARRIED OUT, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES HAVE
BEEN TAKEN.  HE ADDED THE REBELS PLAN TO BURN VEHICLES, DESTROY STORES, BOMB
TELEPHONE LINES, AND STEP UP SABOTAGE OF ELECTRICITY LINES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] TO ACCOMPANY THESE VIOLENT MASS ACTIVITIES, THEY
PLAN TO ATTACK THE MARIONA JAIL.  WE KNOW THE UNTS WILL PAY 7 COLONS TO
EVERY PARTICIPANT IN A DEMONSTRATION.  THEY ARE ALSO SPONSORING A
DEMONSTRATION AT A CAMP FOR DISPLACED PERSONS.  HONEST PEOPLE CAN REST AT
EASE; THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES WILL TAKE THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL MEASURES
TO ENSURE THE RIGHTS OF ALL CITIZENS.  WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TAKING SOME
ACTIONS TO COUNTER ANY VIOLENT ACTIONS THEY MAY CARRY OUT ON 1 MAY. [END

   LIMA, 28 APR 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [INTERVIEW WITH PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT] [BEGIN
RECORDING] [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, CAN YOU GIVE US ACCURATE
INFORMATION ON THIS CLASH?

   [GARCIA] I CAME HERE [REGION OF LOS MOLINOS, 8 KM NORTHEAST OF THE CITY
OF JAUJA, JUNIN DEPARTMENT] WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND WITH THE
PRESIDENT OF THE JOINT COMMAND TO OBSERVE THE SITE OF A CLASH THAT
OCCURRED THIS MORNING, WHEN AN ARMY PATROL COMING FROM JAUJA AND HEADING
FOR JULCAN INTERCEPTED TWO VEHICLES CARRYING A LARGE NUMBER OF HEAVILY
ARMED SUBVERSIVES.

   ACCORDING TO THE FIRST REPORTS, BASED ON THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED FROM THE
SUBVERSIVES, THEY WERE HEADING FOR CONCEPCION, WHICH THEY WERE PLANNING TO
ATTACK. FORTUNATELY, THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY THE ARMY AT THIS PLACE.

   WE HAD 6 DEATHS, AMONG THEM A LIEUTENANT, WHILE MORE THAN 60 SUBVERSIVES
DIED.  A TOTAL OF 47 FAL RIFLES AND SUBMACHINE GUNS WERE RECOVERED.  THEY
WERE HEAVILY ARMED AND THEY CARRIED KNAPSACKS WITH BOMBS.  THEY HAD VEHICLES
AN COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT.  

   WE CAME HERE TO SUPPORT THE ACTION BY THE ARMY, BECAUSE THE ARMY NEEDS
OUR SUPPORT, AND TO LET THE ENTIRE COUNTRY BECOME AWARE OF THE SERIOUSNESS
OF THE SITUATION AND OF THE MAGNITUDE AND INTENSITY OF THE STRUGGLE THAT THE
ARMED FORCES ARE NOW WAGING IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY AND OF THE NATION.

   I BELIEVE THAT THIS DRAMATIC EVENT AND THE LOSS OF OUR SOLDIERS AND
OFFICERS SHOULD MAKE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AWARE OF THE ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY
THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US SHARE IN THE ANTISUBVERSIVE STRUGGLE.

   ALL THE FORCES OF THE STATE AND ALL THE ARMS OF THE NATION HAVE BEEN
PLACED UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS, OF THE
JOINT ARMED FORCES COMMAND, TO FIGHT AND TO ERADICATE THIS TERRIBLE THREAT
OF SUBVERSION. SUBVERSIVE VIOLENCE HAS CAUSED DEATH, MATERIAL LOSSES,
UNCERTAINTY, FEAR, AND INSECURITY, AND A THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, IS THERE INFORMATION ON THE GROUP TO WHICH THE
SUBVERSIVES BELONG?

   [GARCIA] ACCORDING TO THE FIRST REPORTS, THEY BELONG TO THE SELF- STYLED
TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT [MRTA].

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TWO PASSPORTS IN YOUR HANDS.  WHAT DO
THEY SAY?  WHERE WERE THEY ISSUED AND TO WHOM DID THEY BELONG?

   [GARCIA] IDENTIFICATION PAPERS WERE FOUND ON ALMOST ALL SUBVERSIVES,
ALTHOUGH MOST OF THEM ARE FORGED.  THESE TWO BOLIVIAN [AS HEARD] PASSPORTS,
HOWEVER, ARE AMONG THE PAPERS THAT SEEM TO BE LEGITIMATE.  THESE PASSPORTS
MARK THE ARRIVALS AN DEPARTURES OF PERSONS WHO, AS WE CAN SEE, HAVE MISUSED
THE RIGHT TO ENTER PERU.  IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE OTHER FOREIGNERS AMONG THE
DEAD SUBVERSIVES.  ACCORDING TO AN INITIAL EVALUATION, MANY OF THOSE WHO
ATTACKED THE TOWN OF JUANJUI 1 1/2 YEARS AGO MIGHT BE AMONG THE DEAD.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, WERE THE OWNERS OF THOSE PASSPORTS THE LEADERS
OF THE SUBVERSIVE GROUP?

   [GARCIA] NO, WE CANNOT CONFIRM THAT THEY WERE THE LEADERS, BUT THEY WERE
THE PERSONS TO WHOM THE PASSPORTS WERE ISSUED.  

   [REPORTER] ARE THERE CHIEFS AMONG THE DEAD SUBVERSIVES?  

   [GARCIA] ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE OFFICERS, THERE
MIGHT BE CHIEFS AMONG THE DEAD.  

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY, MR PRESIDENT?

   [GARCIA] JUST A FEW, PERHAPS TWO OR THREE, BECAUSE OF THE ARM BANDS THEY
WERE WEARING.

   [REPORTER] THE GENERAL TOLD US THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE HARSHEST BLOWS
THAT THE ARMY HAS DEALT TO SUBVERSIVES.  

   [GARCIA] IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BLOWS, AND IT WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE THE
LAST ONE.  WE HAVE TOTAL CONFIDENCE IN THE ARMED FORCES JOINT COMMAND AND WE
FULLY SUPPORT ITS ACTION.

   IT IS VERY DEPLORABLE, DRAMATIC, AND TRAGIC THAT THIS DRAMATIC EVENT
SHOULD CONVEY THE IMAGE OF PERU TO OUR OWN FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND POSSIBLY TO
FOREIGN COUNTRIES. DEMOCRACY, HOWEVER, SHOULD DEFEND ITSELF.  IT IS BOTH
NECESSARY AND IMPERATIVE THAT WE END THIS TERRIBLE THREAT THROUGH THE
MILITARY POWER OF THE NATION AND THROUGH THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH
WAS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.

   THIS HAS BEEN A HARD BLOW, BUT IT SHOULD BE JUST ONE OF THE HARD BLOWS
THAT THE POLICE AND THE ARMED FORCES DEAL UNTIL THIS THREAT IS TOTALLY
ELIMINATED.

   [REPORTER] THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 APR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY TODAY
LAUNCHED A MILITARY OPERATION IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH INCLUDED VEHICLE
SEARCHES, TO PREVENT A "TERRORIST" PLAN THAT TRADE UNIONS WILL SUPPOSEDLY
CARRY OUT TOMORROW FOLLOWING GUERRILLA ORDERS.

   THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS AND MILITARY POLICE ARE PATROLLING THE CAPITAL BY
LAND AND AIR, CONTROLLING THE ENTRANCES TO SAN SALVADOR, AND HAVE INCREASED
SEARCHES OF VEHICLES AND BUSES FOR WEAPONS.

   THIS OPERATION TAKES PLACE ON THE EVE OF A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) OFFENSIVE SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW, WHEN LABOR UNIONS
HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY WILL HOLD DEMONSTRATIONS IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER
CITIES COMMEMORATING INTERNATIONAL LABOR DAY.  

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) HAS TELEVISED WARNINGS
ACCOMPANIED BY VIDEO CLIPS SHOWING STREET RIOTS, RAIDS ON BUSINESS
ESTABLISHMENTS, AND BURNING OF VEHICLES.

   THE ARMY'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE WORKERS' MARCH WAS PRECEDED BY RAIDS OF
FOUR UNION HEADQUARTERS IN SAN SALVADOR AND THE ARREST OF SOME 100 MEMBERS
OF HUMANITARIAN AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS ON CHARGES OF POSSESSING WEAPONS,
EXPLOSIVES, AND "SUBVERSIVE" PROPAGANDA.

   LEADERS OF THE MAJOR OPPOSITION UNIONS AND LEFTIST POLITICIANS WARNED
TODAY THAT THE THREATS AGAINST THE MARCH "REFLECT AN INCREASE OF REPRESSION"
BY THE FUTURE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) GOVERNMENT BEFORE ITS
1 JUNE INAUGURATION.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE, ARENA STATED THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE EXPECTED IN
MAY "IS BASED ON PLANS BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT TO DESTABILIZE AREA
GOVERNMENTS."

   THE GUERRILLAS HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WILL START A MILITARY OFFENSIVE
TOMORROW TO PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE THAT COULD LEAD TO A
POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT.

   THE MAIN SALVADORAN LABOR UNIONS DENIED THE CHARGES MADE BY THE ARMED
FORCES AND HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR CALLS TO THEIR MEMBERS TO MARCH FOR "PEACE
WITH JUSTICE, WORK, AND LIBERTY."

   A WAR OF WORDS HAS BEEN LAUNCED ON THE MEDIA, WHICH BROADCASTS CALLS FROM
THE ARMY ASKING WORKERS NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARCHES, WHILE UNIONS URGE
THEIR MEMBERS TO COMMEMORATE THE CHICAGO INCIDENTS AT THE END OF THE LAST
CENTURY.

   MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, TODAY ASKED THE
ARMY TO "ACT CALMLY AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE" AGAINST THE TRADE UNIONS.

   "WE HOPE AUTHORITIES WILL NOT SILENCE THE WORKERS' LEGITIMATE CLAMOR FOR
MORE JUSTICE AND PEACE," ROSA CHAVEZ SAID.

   THE PRELATE SAID THAT "LABOR AND PEASANT GROUPS WILL MARCH PEACEFULLY,"
AND THAT THEY ARE NOT LOOKING FOR CONFRONTATION, BUT DEMANDING JUSTICE AND
PEACE.

   ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES, THE GUERRILLAS -- THROUGH "FRONT
ORGANIZATIONS" -- WILL CARRY OUT VIOLENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS SABOTAGES ON
COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS, BANKS, DESTRUCTION OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC VEHICLES
IN SAN SALVADOR, SANTA ANA, AND SAN MIGUEL.

DEMANDED THE EXPULSION OF U.S. TROOPS AND NICARAGUAN CONTRAS FROM THE
COUNTRY, AND THEY DEMANDED HIGHER WAGES, MEASURES TO CONTROL INFLATION,
AND THE CREATION OF NEW JOBS.

   THE ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING WAS MORE MARKED AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE
LEFTIST UNITED FEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS (FUTH), WHO BURNED EIGHT U.S.
FLAGS.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS ALSO BURNED A COFFIN SYMBOLIZING THE BURIAL OF THE
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT (AID).  THEY ALSO BURNED A SCALE MODEL OF THE U.S. PALMEROLA
MILITARY BASE IN CENTRAL HONDURAS.  

   THE HONDURAN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS HELD SEPARATE MARCHES.  THOSE OF THE
RIGHT ENDED THEIR DEMONSTRATION AT THE CENTRAL SQUARE, IN FRONT OF THE
STATUE OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HERO FRANCISCO MORAZAN, WHILE THOSE OF THE LEFT
ENDED THEIR MARCH IN FRONT OF THE MANUEL BONILLA NATIONAL THEATER.

   THE CONSERVATIVE CONFEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS (CTH) AND THE GENERAL
WORKERS FEDERATION (CGT) ALSO CONDEMNED THE PRESENCE OF U.S.  TROOPS AND OF
MORE THAN 10,000 NICARAGUAN CONTRAS IN THE COUNTRY.

   "YANKEES GET OUT OF HONDURAS," "CONTRAS GET OUT," "TO PAY THE FOREIGN
DEBT IS TO KILL THE PEOPLE," AND "JOBS AND NOT MORE MILITARY AID" WERE SOME
OF THE SLOGANS ON PLACARDS AND BANNERS CARRIED BY THE WORKERS.

   THE SPEAKERS FROM THE MAIN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS DEMANDED THAT PRESIDENT
JOSE AZCONA'S GOVERNMENT RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, AMEND THE LABOR CODE, REFORM
THE SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTE, INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE, AND RESPECT THE
RIGHT TO WORK AND JOB SECURITY.

   "WE WANT A FREEZE ON PRICES OF STAPLES, HOUSING PROGRAMS, RESPECT FOR
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, DEMOCRATIZATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT," CTH SECRETARY GENERAL
VICTOR ARTILES SAID.

   THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS STRESSED THAT THERE CAN BE NO PEACE IN THE
COUNTRY WITH MORE THAN 1.2 MILLION UNEMPLOYED AND A POPULATION WITH
DEFICIENT HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND FOOD SERVICES.

   THEY ALSO SAID THEY ARE AGAINST THE SHIPMENT OF WEAPONS TO HONDURAS AND
AGAINST THE CREATION OF NEW MILITARY UNITS.  

   FUTH PRESIDENT HECTOR HERNANDEZ SAID THAT HONDURAS "IS NOT ONLY FACING
CONSTANT PRESSURE TO DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY BUT ALSO DAILY PRESSURE TO DEVALUE
OUR DIGNITY AS A NATION."

   HERNANDEZ CONDEMNED THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS AND THE CONTRAS, AND HE
SAID THAT "EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO MAKE US PAY FOR A FOREIGN DEBT WE DO
NOT OWE."

   "THAT DEBT WAS PAID A LONG TIME AGO, AND WE MUST ASK WHETHER IT IS THE
DEVELOPED CAPITALIST COUNTRIES THAT OWE US BECAUSE OF THEIR LOOTING OF OUR
NATURAL RESOURCES," HE ADDED.

   OSCAR ANIBAL PUERTO, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE HONDURAN HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENSE
COMMITTEE (CODEH), SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES, AND NOT THE HONDURAN
GOVERNMENT, IS THE ONE THAT ISSUES THE NATIONAL POLICY GUIDELINES.

   PUERTO CONDEMNED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THROUGH
ILLEGAL ARRESTS AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE.

TODAY DENIED HAVING CARRIED OUT A DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST A U.S. EMBASSY
WAREHOUSE IN SAN SALVADOR, AN ATTACK OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE BLAMED ON THE

   OFFICIAL SOURCES REPORT TODAY THAT URBAN GUERRILLAS THREW TWO EXPLOSIVE
DEVICES FROM A VEHICLE AT THE SAN JORGE WAREHOUSE, A U.S.  EMBASSY FACILITY
IN THE SAN ANTONIO ABAD NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR.  

   A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SPOKESMAN CLAIMED THAT
THE ATTACK WAS "A CRUDE MANEUVER BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND THE NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA), WHICH WILL BE GOVERNING EL SALVADOR AS OF 1
JUNE, TO COMPLICATE THE GUERRILLA DELEGATION'S U.S. VISIT."  THE REBEL
SOURCE CONFIRMED AN FMLN DECISION FIRST ANNOUNCED 3 MONTHS AGO THAT NO U.S.
DIPLOMATIC OR ECONOMIC FACILITY IN EL SALVADOR WILL BE CONSIDERED A MILITARY
TARGET.

   AN FMLN DELEGATION WILL MEET TODAY IN NEW YORK WITH UN ASSISTANT
SECRETARY ALVARO DE SOTO AND PERMANENT UN REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FRG,
CANADA, AND SPAIN.  MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL DIPLOMATIC GUERRILLA
DELEGATION, WHICH OBTAINED UNRESTRICTED VISAS, WILL ASK THE UNITED NATIONS
TO PARTICIPATE MORE ACTIVELY IN THE SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMED CONFLICT.  THE GUERRILLAS WILL ALSO ASK THE UNITED NATIONS
TO REMAIN ALERT TO THE SITUATION AND TO EXERT PRESSURE ON THE FUTURE ARENA
ADMINISTRATION -- TO BE HEADED BY RIGHTIST ALFREDO CRISTIANI -- TO ENSURE
THAT IT RESPECTS HUMAN RIGHTS.

   LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO, AN ARENA
MEMBER, DESCRIBED THE REBEL DELEGATION'S U.S. VISIT AS "DANGEROUS AND
RIDICULOUS."  "I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE UNITED STATES COULD GRANT
VISAS TO TERRORISTS," ALVARENGA SAID IN REFERENCE TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S

   TEGUCIGALPA, 4 MAY 89 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTERS AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE IN TEGUCIGALPA] [TEXT] [REPORTER]
[PASSAGE OMITTED] ...FOR PEACE.

   [CRISTIANI] PRESIDENT DUARTE HAS NOT HAD THE LUCK OF STRIKING A
RESPONSIVE CHORD IN THE SALVADORAN MARXIST GUERRILLAS.  WE HOPE THAT WITH
NEW EFFORTS AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF SALVADORAN POLITICAL FORCES WE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] PEACE.  WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT TO BE SEEN IN ITS FULL DIMENSION:  IT IS PART OF A
REGIONAL PROBLEM, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE [CENTRAL AMERICAN] PRESIDENTS
HAVE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THIS INTERNAL CONFLICT AT THEIR MEETINGS.

   [REPORTER] I HAVE A QUESTION ON BILATERAL RELATIONS.  WILL YOUR
GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE RULING BY THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE [ICJ] AT
THE HAGUE REGARDING THE DEMARCATION OF THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS?  

   [CRISTIANI] WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN
THE TWO COUNTRIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST BEGIN TO RESOLVE ALL THE
DIFFERENCES THAT OUR TWO COUNTRIES MAY HAVE HAD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THIS
IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE MENTIONED TO PRESIDENT AZCONA.  CONTRARY
TO WHAT SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE SAID, WE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST SEEK A SOLUTION
TO THE PROBLEMS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND CONTINUE
IMPROVING A RELATIONSHIP THAT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED.

   WE ARE GOING TO RESPECT THE PEACE PROCESS THAT IS ALREADY UNDER WAY
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE AGREEMENT TO TAKE THE MATTER TO
THE ICJ FOR RESOLUTION.

   [REPORTER] INTERNATIONAL REPORTS STATE THAT VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED IN EL
SALVADOR SINCE YOUR PARTY WON THE ELECTIONS.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF YOU
TRIED TO CONTACT THE GUERRILLAS PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS OR ARE YOU GOING TO
WAIT FOR THE SITUATION TO DETERIORATE EVEN FURTHER?  [WORDS INDISTINCT] TAKE
POWER?

   [CRISTIANI] THE MARXIST GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR HAS PUBLICLY
ADMITTED THAT IT IS INCREASING ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS IN OUR COUNTRY IN AN
ATTEMPT TO DESTABILIZE THE NEW GOVERNMENT.  WE HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY
VIOLENCE; I BELIEVE THE VICTORY OF OUR PARTY IN THE RECENT ELECTIONS DID NOT
REPRESENT MORE VIOLENCE.  VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT MERINO HEADED THE DELEGATION
THAT MET WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS IN MEXICO, AND FROM THE VERY
BEGINNING WE HAVE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS TO SEEK, VIA A DIALOGUE, A
SOLUTION TO OUR CONFLICT.

   NATURALLY, WE CANNOT YET ACT AS A GOVERNMENT, AND WE ARE GOING TO RESPECT
THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GUERRILLAS.  ONCE OUR
ADMINISTRATION IS IN PLACE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE GREATEST EFFORT TO
SEEK A DIALOGUE AND A SOLUTION.

   [REPORTER] ARE YOU PLANNING TO ASK THE UNITED STATES FOR AN INCREASE IN
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID?

   [CRISTIANI] NO.  DURING OUR RECENT TRIP TO WASHINGTON, ALL WE SAID IS
THAT WE TRUST THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE ARE IN FAVOR OF THE
STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.  ON THIS OCCASION WE BENEFITTED
FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT GENERATE, A PRIORI, ANY
PREJUDICE AGAINST THE NEW SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT THAT COULD RESULT IN A
MODIFICATION OF U.S. AID TO OUR COUNTRY.

   WE HAVE NOT ASKED FOR ANY INCREASE IN AID.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD
DEVELOP OURSELVES AND HAVE EL SALVADOR BECOME SELF-SUPPORTING.  WE HOPE THAT
WITH THE HELP OF THE LORD WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS [WORDS INDISTINCT] NOT
BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO MAINTAIN OUR FRIENDSHIP, BUT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
THAT EL SALVADOR CAN BECOME SELF-SUPPORTING.  

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT] [CRISTIANI] FRANKLY, I WAS SURPRISED BY
THIS STATEMENT BY DANIEL ORTEGA.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE HAS BASED HIS
OPINION ON.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS THE RESULT OF MEETINGS THAT HE MIGHT
HAVE HAD WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] WHO HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM NICARAGUA.  HOWEVER, AS WE HAVE JUST
REITERATED, OUR INTENTION IS TO CONTINUE WITH THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN
UNDER WAY SINCE ESQUIPULAS II WAS SIGNED, AND TO SEEK DEMOCRACY AND PEACE
IN CENTRAL AMERICA BY MEANS OF A JOINT EFFORT BY OUR COUNTRIES.

   [REPORTER] IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT THE NEXT SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS WILL BE HELD IN OUR COUNTRY IN JUNE.  YOU ARE SLATED TO ATTEND
BECAUSE YOU WILL BE INAUGURATED ON 1 JUNE.  WHAT POSITION WILL EL SALVADOR
TAKE AT THE MEETING, AND TO WHAT EXTENT HAS YOUR GOVERNMENT COMPLIED WITH
THE COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS? [CONTINUED]
