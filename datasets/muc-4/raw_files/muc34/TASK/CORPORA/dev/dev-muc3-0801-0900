SPANISH UNDER FOREIGN SECRETARY, SAID TODAY THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI "PROMISED TO CARRY OUT A PROMPT AND SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION" AND "TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE" FOR THE MURDER OF SIX
JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   ARIAS ADDED THAT THE MEETING HELD THIS AFTERNOON WITH PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI WAS "CORDIAL AND SINCERE."

   ARIAS, WHO ARRIVED TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR ALONG WITH OTHER HIGH-RANKING
SPANISH OFFICIALS, SAID THAT "THE PRESIDENT SEEMS WILLING TO PROMOTE A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRIBLE
MASSACRE."

   THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION CAME TO EL SALVADOR AFTER SIX JESUITS, FIVE
OF THEM SPANISH, WERE MURDERED BY INDIVIDUALS WEARING MILITARY
UNIFORMS.

   INOCENCIO ARIAS AFFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS "A LUCID,
INTELLIGENT, AND WELL-INTENDED PERSON," WHO IS "APPARENTLY INTERESTED
IN CLARIFYING THE FACTS."

   AFTER MEETING WITH ARIAS, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT EXPLAINED TO
ACAN-EFE THAT HE REQUESTED EXPERTS BE SENT FROM SPAIN, THE UNITED
STATES, AND GREAT BRITAIN.

   CRISTIANI JUSTIFIED THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN EXPERTS "FROM SPAIN,
BECAUSE THE JESUITS WERE SPANISH; FROM THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE THEY
REQUESTED IT; AND FROM GREAT BRITAIN, BECAUSE OF THE FAME OF SCOTLAND
YARD.

   ACCORDING TO ARIAS, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI "WAS AFFECTED BY THE DEATHS
OF THE PRIESTS."

   ARIAS SAID THAT DURING HIS VISIT TO EL SALVADOR, HE WILL ALSO TRY
TO "WORK ON THE DEPARTURE OF THOSE SPANISH WHO ARE IN GREATER DANGER
IN THE COUNTRY."

   THE OFFICIAL DECLINED BLAMING ANY GROUP FOR THE DEATH OF THE
JESUITS AND THE TWO WOMEN, BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
TOLD HIM THAT "THE REPONSIBLE PERSONS, WHOEVER THEY MAY BE, WILL BE
PUNISHED."

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES, AS AN INSTITUTION, ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE
CASE TO THE VERY END TO UNCOVER WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES."

   WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THEY MAY BE MILITARY MEMBERS, HE
ANSWERED THAT "THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT RULED OUT THAT THEY MIGHT
HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE ARMY, AND THEY ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE
THIS THOROUGHLY."

   HOWEVER, CRISTIANI REJECTED THE "PREMATURE INTERPRETATIONS" THAT
CLAIM THE MILITARY CARRIED OUT THE MULTIPLE CRIME.

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TOLD THE SPANISH DIPLOMAT THAT THE
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR "WILL BE PEACEFUL IN A FEW DAYS," AND HE
REITERATED THAT HE "IS WILLING TO CONTINUE WITH THE DIALOGUE."

   HOWEVER, HE TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "WE ARE NOT GOING TO ATTEND A
MEETING THAT WILL NOT BE ATTENDED BY THE OTHER PARTY," REFERRING TO
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE NOT PLANNING TO ATTEND THE
MEETING SLATED TO START ON 20 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.

   ACCORDING TO ARIAS, CRISTIANI INSISTS THAT THE SITUATION IS
"PRETTY MUCH CONTROLLED IN THE COUNTRY," ALTHOUGH THE SALVADORAN        
PRESIDENT WARNED THEM "THERE MIGHT BE NEW OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE."

   TODAY MARKS THE 8TH DAY OF THE BLOODY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND
THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.  IT HAS LEFT AT LEAST 1,000 PERSONS DEAD,
HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WOUNDED, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PERSONS
DISPLACED, WHO HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND TOWNS TO FLEE
FROM THE CROSSFIRE OF THE FIGHTERS AND THE BOMBINGS OF THE SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE.

DEV-MUC3-0808 (PRC)

   SAN SALVADOR, 18 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [EXCERPT] THE CAPITAL FELL INTO DARKNESS
SATURDAY NIGHT AS ELECTRICAL SERVICE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR WAS CUT AND THE
COUNTRY ENTERED THE EIGHTH DAY OF A NATIONWIDE REBEL OFFENSIVE.

   INSURGENTS FROM THE LEFTIST FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) STILL HELD KEY POSITIONS AROUND THE CAPITAL, FENDING OFF
FIERCE SALVADORAN AIR AND ARTILLERY ATTACKS.

   THE POWER OUTAGE, WHICH HAD AFFECTED CERTAIN ZONES OF THE CITY AND
SURROUNDING SUBURBS BUT NOT THE ENTIRE CITY OVER THE PAST WEEK OF
FIGHTING, CAME AMID UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THAT THE ARMY WAS PREPARING A
MAJOR COUNTER-OFFENSIVE TO DRIVE THE REBELS FROM THE SAN SALVADOR
METROPOLITAN AREA.

   GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS BLOCKED ALL ACCESS TO THE REBEL-HELD NORTHERN
AND EASTERN SECTORS OF THE CAPITAL.

   THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS CONTINUED TO FLEE THE COMBAT ZONES, WHERE
A NUMBER HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE CROSS-FIRE SINCE THE LEFTIST FMLN
LAUNCHED ITS ATTACK NOVEMBER 11 -- THE BOLDEST OFFENSIVE OF THE
10-YEAR CIVIL WAR.

   INSURGENTS WHO THURSDAY HAD EVACUATED THE DISTRICT OF ZACAMIL --
DEVASTATED BY THE ARMED FORCES' AERIAL FIREBOMBINGS -- REGROUPED IN
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AN AREA NORTH OF THE CAPITAL, ACCORDING TO PRESS
REPORTS.

   FIGHTING WAS REPORTEDLY ALSO RAGING IN APOPA, 12 KILOMETERS (7.5
MILES) NORTH OF THE CAPITAL ON THE MAJOR NORTHERN ROUTE.

   IN THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL, 140 KILOMETERS (87 MILES) EAST OF THE
CAPITAL, THE REBELS SHOT DOWN A GOVERNMENT A-37 COMBAT PLANE,
JOURNALISTS THERE SAID.  THIS CONFIRMED EARLIER FMLN RADIO REPORTS
THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAD SHOT DOWN AN ARMY DRAGON FLY A-37 AS IT WAS
BOMBING REBEL-OCCUPIED SECTIONS OF THE CITY.

   AUTHORITIES ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN 2,000 PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED
OR INJURED IN THE CONFLICT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] CIN REPORTS THE
FOLLOWING TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE:

   1.  THE ARMED FORCES HAS ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER NATIONAL TERRITORY

AND TREES.

   2.  CITIZENS WHO ARE STILL STILL SEEKING REFUGE IN THEIR WORK
PLACES ARE ADVISED TO RETURN TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES BEFORE 1800
WHEN THE CURFEW BEGINS.

NATIONAL GUARD, TREASURY POLICE, NATIONAL POLICE, AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT
BATTALIONS SUCH AS THE ATLCATL, ATONAL, ARCE, BELLOSO, AND BRACAMONTE,
AND BRIGADES BELONGING TO OUR GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
DEFEATED FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] MURDERERS TO
ENSURE THE FREEDOM AND TRANQUILLITY OF OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS.
WARLIKE OPERATIONS LAUNCHED IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH INVOLVED
GROUND AND AIR FORCES, WERE NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENCE AND
CRUELTY SHOWN BY THE TERRORIST MURDERERS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.

   6.  ALL BASIC AND VITAL SERVICES IN THE COUNTRY, SUCH AS WATER AND
ELECTRICITY, ARE BEING PROVIDED NORMALLY AND ARE UNDER ARMED FORCES

   CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COMMANDER ROBERTO
ROCA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] COMMANDER ROBERTO
ROCA, THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THE JESUITS' [WORDS INDISTINCT] WERE NOT
LONG IN COMING.  ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONES WAS THE EDITORIAL OF
AN IMPORTANT U.S.  NEWSPAPER, THE NEW YORK TIMES, ON 18 NOVEMBER.  THE
EDITORIAL SAYS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT IF PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI DOES NOT ORDER A QUICK, THOROUGH, AND GENUINE INVESTIGATION
TO CATCH THE ASSASSINS, HE MIGHT LOSE THE UNITED STATES' ECONOMIC AID.

   THE EDITORIAL ALSO STATES THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE SAID THAT
THE MILITARY AID SHOULD BE SUSPENDED IF EL SALVADOR CANNOT CONTROL AND
PUNISH THE DEATH SQUADS.  THEY ADD THAT IF HE DOES NOT HEED THE
WARNING, THE NEXT STATEMENT MIGHT BE ISSUED BY BOTH PARTIES.  WHAT ARE
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS IMPORTANT STATEMENT BY AN INFLUENTIAL U.S.
NEWSPAPER FOR CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES?

   [ROCA] ACTUALLY, THE NEW YORK TIMES STATES THE FEELING PERVADING
THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES.  IT IS A WAY OF CONFIRMING THAT THE FASCIST
GROUPS PREVAIL WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE], AND THEY ARE DECIDING THE REGIME'S POLICIES.
POLITICAL OPINION IN THE UNITED STATES HAS UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN SHAKEN BY
THIS MASSACRE PLANNED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.

   WE BELIEVE THAT U.S. POLITICIANS WILL PROGRESSIVELY COME TO SUPPORT
THE U.S. PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND WILL DEMAND THAT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT
ORDER THE INVESTIGATION.  WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL NOT BE EASY IN EL
SALVADOR, BECAUSE, AS THE EDITORIAL POINTS OUT, SIMILAR ASSASSINATIONS
HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED INNUMERABLE TIMES.  THESE CASES HAVE BEEN
SURROUNDED BY ABSOLUTE SECRECY; NO CULPRITS ARE FOUND; AND WITNESSES
HAVE TESTIFIED MANY TIMES THAT THE ACTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT BY ARMED
FORCES MEMBERS, EITHER DRESSED AS CIVILIANS OR IN UNIFORM.  HOWEVER,
THE POLICY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT PROTECTS THE
CULPRITS.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CIVILIAN ASSASSINATION, MEANING THE
ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE FACT THAT PRACTICALLY ALL THE
LEADERS OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT WERE SOUGHT OUT THAT SAME NIGHT TO BE
KILLED, PLUS THE FACT THAT THE KILLING OF THE COOPERATIVE MEMBERS WAS
CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE GREAT BATTLES BEING FOUGHT IN
EL SALVADOR'S URBAN AREAS, WILL EVENTUALLY CONVINCE U.S.  POLITICIANS
THAT THE GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING IS CLEARLY A FASCIST
GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN ANY KIND OF DEMOCRATIC
CONSOLIDATION.  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COMMANDER ROBERTO ROCA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] [ROCA] REAL LIFE IS MAKING IT EVIDENT THAT IN EL
SALVADOR WE MUST FIND A DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION TO THE TERRIBLE CRISIS
BEING ENDURED -- TO THE WAR.  THIS DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION MEANS ISOLATING
AND EXCLUDING THE FASCISTS FROM POWER BECAUSE THEY ARE AGAINST
DEMOCRACY.

   MR CRISTIANI CANNOT SAY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE SHARES NO
RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS.  IN THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS
FRUSTRATED ATTEMPT TO STOP THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, HE UNLEASHED THE
DOGS OF WAR -- ALL THE FASCIST ELEMENTS -- SO THAT THEY WOULD COMMIT
ALL THE OUTRAGES THEY HAVE COMMITTED.  THIS INCLUDES THE FASCIST
ELEMENTS IN THE AIR FORCE AND THEIR INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING OF THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION, AS WELL AS THE DEATH SQUADS, WHO WERE UNLEASHED
SO THEY WOULD MURDER PEOPLE WHO BEST EXPRESS THE DEMOCRATIC FEELINGS
OF THE PEOPLE AND, AS IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, TO ELIMINATE
A VALUABLE SECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN INTELLIGENTSIA AT THE SERVICE OF
DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.

   AS WE ALL KNOW, THE JESUITS HAD CONTINUOUSLY DENOUNCED THE UNJUST
SYSTEM IN EL SALVADOR AND HAD CALLED FOR CLEARING UP ALL CRIMES.  THE
FASCISTS, IN THEIR HATRED, PUT AN END TO THE LIVES OF THESE JESUITS
BELIEVING THAT THEY CAN HIDE THE SUN WITH ONE FINGER.  THE INDIGNATION
OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL BE INCREASINGLY BACKED BY THE U.S.
PEOPLE AS A RESULT OF THEIR INDIGNATION AND BY U.S.  POLITICIANS WHO
HAVE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO PUT AN END TO
FASCIST OUTRAGES IN EL SALVADOR.  THE FASCISTS REPRESENT A BARRIER
THAT MUST BE DESTROYED AND DEFEATED TO HAVE DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER, IF THE UNITED STATES DECIDED TO CUT OFF
MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, WHAT IMPACT
WOULD THIS HAVE ON THE ARMED FORCES?

   [ROCA] WE HAVE SAID ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES WOULD HAVE LOST THE WAR SOME TIME AGO WERE IT NOT FOR U.S.
SUPPORT AND FINANCING.  AS WE HAVE STATED IN ALL OUR PROPOSALS FOR A
POLITICAL SOLUTION, OUR OBJECTIVE IS NEITHER THE DESTRUCTION NOR THE
ELIMINATION OF THE ARMED FORCES.  WHAT WE WANT IS FOR THE ARMED FORCES
TO GET RID OF THE FASCIST ELEMENTS THAT HAVE TURNED IT INTO A TOOL
THAT ACTS AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND DEMOCRACY.

   WE BELIEVE THAT SENSIBLE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, THOSE
WHO HAVE NOT LOST THEIR HEADS, MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION [WORDS
INDISTINCT] INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING, THE POLITICAL DEFEAT OF THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, AND THE MILITARY DEFEAT OF THE METHODS AND
TACTICS [WORDS INDISTINCT].  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH SALVADOR
SAMAYOA, MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT-DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY
FRONT, FMLN-FDR, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[SAMAYOA] THEREFORE, THE WESTERN EUROPEAN PRESS, POLITICAL PARTIES,
LABOR UNIONS, AND GENERAL PUBLIC ARE VERY STRONGLY REJECTING
CRISTIANI'S REGIME.  THE CONGRESSES AND PARLIAMENTS OF MANY WESTERN
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE SAYING THAT THE COOPERATION THE SALVADORAN
REGIME RECEIVES SHOULD BE REEVALUATED.

   [REPORTER] COMRADE SALVADOR SAMAYOA, THE GOVERNMENT NETWORK IS
REPORTING THAT U.S. AID TO CRISTIANI WILL CONTINUE.  THE COLONELS HAVE
ALSO SAID THAT THE FMLN CANNOT DEFEAT THE ARMED FORCES BECAUSE THE
LATTER HAS MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
RETURNING TO THIS POINT, COMRADE SAMAYOA, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?  WHAT
OPTIONS DOES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE CONCERNING EL SALVADOR, AND WHAT
IMPACT HAS THE NEW SITUATION HAD ON U.S. POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR?

   [SAMAYOA] AS I SAID, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION THAT A NEW INTERNAL SITUATION OF GENERALIZED POPULAR,
POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL DISCONTENT IS TAKING SHAPE, AND THAT FROM THIS
MOMENT ON ITS POLICY IN EL SALVADOR WILL UNDERGO ISOLATION AND WILL BE
REJECTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND EVEN BY VERY IMPORTANT SECTORS
WITHIN THE HOUSE AND SENATE.

   SO FAR, THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS STUBBORNLY CONTINUED PROVIDING
AID AND SUPPORT TO A REGIME THAT IS OBVIOUSLY CRIMINAL AND GENOCIDAL,
AND THAT POLICY IS [WORDS INDISTINCT] CURRENTLY A VERY STRONG DEBATE
IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT
ARE TO SINK WITH THE CRISTIANI REGIME, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY MOVING
TOWARD DEFEAT AND MILITARY AND POLITICAL DESTRUCTION DESPITE ALL THE
PROPAGANDA IT HAS MADE, OR TO CHANGE ITS OPINION WHILE THERE IS STILL
TIME.  THE ALTERNATIVE OF A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT, A REPLACEMENT OF
CRISTIANI'S REGIME OR THE MILITARY HIERARCHY, IS ALREADY UNDER
DISCUSSION.  THESE, THEREFORE, ARE THE TWO ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO
THE UNITED STATES: EITHER CHANGE ITS POLICY IN TIME AND REPLACE
CRISTIANI, OR THE GOVERNMENT WILL SINK BECAUSE ITS PROPAGANDA IS NOT
WORKING.

   THE U.S. AMBASSADOR HAS MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF.  HE SAID THE
GUERRILLAS HAD 1,500 MEN IN SAN SALVADOR, AND HE HAS LISTED CASUALTY
FIGURES ACCORDING TO WHICH THE FMLN SUFFERED OVER 500 DEATHS, OVER 400
WOUNDED, AND OTHERS CAPTURED.  ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES QUOTED BY THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR, WHO PROVIDES GOVERNMENT WAR BULLETINS AND HAS ALMOST
BECOME THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTER, THE FMLN ONLY HAS 200 MEN LEFT
IN SAN SALVADOR.

   WHAT I FIND INEXPLICABLE IS THE GOVERNMENT'S NEED TO USE 40 OR 50
WAR PLANES AND HELICOPTERS, ALONG WITH ITS ARTILLERY AND ELITE
BATTALIONS, TO BOMB AND DESTROY CITIES, ESPECIALLY SAN SALVADOR.  THAT
IS WHY THEIR PROPAGANDA HAS BACKFIRED ON THEM.  IN THE UNITED STATES
THE PRESS AND GENERAL PUBLIC KNOW FULL WELL THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE IS
IN FULL FORCE AND IS MOVING FORWARD, AND THAT THE U.S.  POLICY IS
REACHING THE POINT OF TOTAL FAILURE.

   [REPORTER] TO CONCLUDE, COMRADE SAMAYOA, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE ON
RADIO VENCEREMOS TO THE COMRADES WHO HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR POSITIONS
IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND VARIOUS
POINTS OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY?  WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE
FIGHTERS AND THE PEOPLE?

   [SAMAYOA] TO ALL THE COMRADES WHO ARE FIGHTING IN TRENCHES
THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF OUR COUNTRY, I MUST SAY THAT THE
AFFECTION AND ADMIRATION YOU HAVE GENERATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THE
SOLIDARITY WITH YOUR STRUGGLE, AND THE SURPRISING STRENGTH AND HEROISM
YOU HAVE DISPLAYED ARE NOW RECEIVING SUPPORT FROM ALMOST ALL OF THE
COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.  THEREFORE, OUR STRUGGLE NOT ONLY IS NOT
ALONE, BUT IT HAS NOW ACHIEVED MAXIMUM SUPPORT OF ALL TYPES:
POLITICAL, MATERIAL, ECONOMIC.  SOLIDARITY HAS MULTIPLIED HUNDREDFOLD
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, AND IT WILL BE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF
SUPPORT THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO COMPLETING THE FASCIST REGIME'S
DESTRUCTION.  THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD ADMIRE THE STRUGGLE THE COMRADES
AND FIGHTERS IN ALL THE CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE WAGING, AND THEY
VERY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE IS FOR A JUST CAUSE AND
AGAINST A COMPLETELY ILLEGITIMATE, FASCIST, AND CRIMINAL REGIME.

   THE COMRADES CAN REST ASSURED OF THIS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, WHICH
IS CURRENTLY VERY GREAT.  IT IS IMPRESSIVE TO SEE ALL OF THE AFFECTION
AND ADMIRATION THAT OUR FIGHTERS ARE RECEIVING FROM ALL OVER THE
WORLD.

   [REPORTER] THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SALVADOR.  OUR GREETINGS TO ALL THE
OTHER COMRADES.

   [SAMAYOA] THANK YOU, [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

   CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION.  WE HAVE
REPORTS THAT THERE IS HEAVY FIGHTING GOING ON IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN
SALVADOR AND IN APOPA.  PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.  THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS INTENSIFIED FIGHTING AGAINST SPECIAL BATTALIONS
IN SAN SALVADOR.  WE ALSO REPORT THAT DURING THIS FIGHTING IN SAN SALVADOR,
AT 1600 THIS AFTERNOON, OUR ANTI-AIRCRAFT CREWS DOWNED A SALVADORAN AIR
FORCE HELICOPTER.  WE HIT THE HELICOPTER NEAR SAQUIRO IN ARCE STREET AND IT
CRASHED.  WE ARE TO RECEIVE MORE DETAILS AND A REPORT ABOUT THE CREW'S FATE
LATER.

   WE REPEAT, A SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER WAS DOWNED IN SAN
SALVADOR AT 1600 TODAY.  THIS IS THE SECOND HELICOPTER WE HAVE DOWNED
IN URBAN COMBAT.  AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR OFFENSIVE WE REPORTED THAT A
HELICOPTER HAD BEEN DOWNED AND ONE OF ITS PILOTS HAD BEEN KILLED.

   CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT-DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY
FRONT, FMLN-FDR, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] COMRADE
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS ON STATEMENTS BY THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR IN SAN SALVADOR, WILLIAM WALKER, WHO SAID THAT DESPITE THE
BOMBINGS HIS GOVERNMENT, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, WILL CONTINUE GIVING
MILITARY AID AND SUPPORT TO THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, IT
SEEMS THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE
JESUITS.  AT THIS MOMENT, HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES PERCEIVE THE NEW
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR?

   [SAMAYOA] AT THE LEVEL OF THE U.S. PEOPLE, THERE IS A TOTAL
REPUDIATION OF THE FASCIST CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT AND OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES BECAUSE OF THE BOMBINGS -- WHICH HAVE BECOME A TRUE
GENOCIDE -- IN VARIOUS DENSELY POPULATED CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS IN
EL SALVADOR, AS WELL AS BECAUSE OF THE ASSASSINATIONS PERPETRATED BY
THE SALVADORAN ARMY AGAINST THE JESUIT PRIESTS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY [UCA].  THERE HAVE BEEN VERY RADICAL DEMONSTRATIONS
EXPRESSING MUCH INDIGNATION BY VARIOUS U.S. SOCIAL SECTORS.  MOREOVER,
IN SOME OF THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS, THE POLICE BARRICADES WERE BROKEN.
IMPORTANT U.S. POLITICAL PERSONALITIES SUCH AS JESSE JACKSON, ONE OF
THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTICIPATED IN THE
DEMONSTRATIONS.  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS IN BOSTON,
CHICAGO, NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, AND LOS ANGELES.  IN AT LEAST 20
CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED ALL THEIR
REPUDIATION AND INDIGNATION OVER THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE U.S.
POLICY IN EL SALVADOR.

   SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF THE UCA PRIESTS, A LARGE NUMBER OF
IMPORTANT U.S. SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES ARE SAYING THAT U.S.
MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE
CUT AND SUSPENDED.  SENATOR KENNEDY IN PARTICULAR MADE A VERY STRONG
STATEMENT, SAYING THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' ATTITUDE SIMPLY
EXPRESSES THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF U.S. POLICY -- WHICH HAS BEEN
SPENT FEEDING, TRAINING, ARMING, AND FINANCING AN ARMED FORCE THAT
CARRIES OUT ASSASSINATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO SENATOR KENNEDY, THERE ARE
MANY U.S. SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN WHO ARE REQUESTING THE TOTAL
SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR.  AT THIS TIME, THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF
REPUDIATION IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE
WHITE HOUSE CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE [SALVADORAN] CRIMINAL
REGIME AND GIVING IT FURTHER EMERGENCY AID.

   [REPORTER] COMRADE, YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT ARTICLES PUBLISHED
IN THE MAIN U.S. NEWSPAPERS THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON
POST, WHICH STRONGLY QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT, SPECIFICALLY PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI, THE CHIEF OF THE FASCIST DICTATORSHIP.  WHAT IS THE
SITUATION OF THE CRISTIANI SPEECH AND HIS ALLEGED LEGITIMACY, NOT ONLY
IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO AT THE LEVEL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY?

   [SAMAYOA] THE ALLEGED LEGITIMACY OF CRISTIANI COLLAPSED.  IN THE
UNITED STATES, THEY SAID CRISTIANI WAS [WORDS INDISTINCT] HAD GOOD
INTENTIONS, BUT THE RIGHT-WING [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND THE DEATH SQUADS
DID NOT LET HIM WORK.  THE SPEECH FAILED BECAUSE IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT
AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES, CRISTIANI IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE GENOCIDE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY
[WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE MEDIA HAVE ALSO REPORTED THE ARREST OF U.S.
RELIGIOUS MEN AND OF SWISS, FRENCH, SPANISH, AND JAPANESE CITIZENS.
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT ACCUSING EVERYONE OF
COOPERATING WITH THE GUERRILLAS, AND THIS HAS CAUSED A TOTAL LOSS OF
THE GOVERNMENT'S PRESTIGE. EDITORIALS ON 18 NOVEMBER IN THE MAIN U.S.
NEWSPAPERS [WORDS INDISTINCT] CRISTIANI IS NOT MORE THAN [WORDS
INDISTINCT]. AT EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES IN MOST COUNTRIES IN WESTERN
EUROPE -- IN ITALY, SPAIN, THE FRG, FRANCE, SWEDEN, DENMARK AND
EVERYWHERE -- THERE HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS CALLED BY LABOR UNIONS,
POLITICAL PARTIES, AND PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES TO
EXPRESS REPUDIATION.  IN LONDON, ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS HUMAN
RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, URGED EVERYONE TO STAGE
DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF ALL SALVADORAN EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN'S
ROBERTO ROCA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [ROCA] THE
GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE HAS NOT BEEN DEFEATED AND CANNOT BE DEFEATED.
INTERNATIONAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES HAVE
BECOME STRONG IN THE CITY, THAT THEY ARE MAKING TACTICAL MOVEMENTS,
AND THAT IN SPITE OF THE BARBARISM WITH WHICH THE ARMED FORCES HAS
BEEN OPERATING, THE GUERRILLAS MAINTAIN ALL OF THEIR OPERATIONAL
CAPABILITIES.

   THE SITUATION CANNOT DEFEAT US.  THERE MUST BE A SOLUTION, AND THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY, AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS, BECOMING
INVOLVED IN THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS TO DEFEAT THE FASCISTS AND THE
GENOCIDAL TACTICS THEY ARE USING.

   WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION, AND THIS UNDOUBTEDLY WILL HAVE AN EFFECT
ON THE ARMED FORCES AND COULD RESULT IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE
INSTITUTION.

   WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE ARMED FORCES THERE ARE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS
WHO REJECT FASCISM.  THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DESERTIONS IN THE ARMY
FILES.  MANY ORDERS ARE BEING DISOBEYED, ORDERS OF A GENOCIDAL NATURE
USUALLY.  THIS IS THE STARTING POINT OF AN EVENT THAT WILL STUN
POLITICAL OPINION IN EL SALVADOR.

   WE BELIEVE THAT IF THIS SAVAGE KILLING OF PEOPLE DOES NOT STOP, THE
MILITARY INSTITUTION WILL BE SIGNING ITS OWN DEATH SENTENCE.  THE
PEOPLE CANNOT TOLERATE A MILITARY THAT FUNCTIONS UNDER A MOST SAVAGE
AND DESPOTIC REGIME, AND THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS IN HOT WATER, WE
COULD SAY.

   THE REVOLUTIONARY OFFENSIVE, AS I HAVE NOTED, IS BEING DEVELOPED.
WE HAVE SOLID POSITIONS IN FOUR OF EL SALVADOR'S MAIN CITIES, AND AS
WE HAVE SAID BEFORE: NO ONE IS GOING TO PUSH US OUT.  VICTORY FOR
DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN ASSURED.  THE WORLD WILL BACK US IN THE FACE OF THE
SAVAGE GENOCIDE BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES, ESPECIALLY BY THE FASCIST
MILITARY ELEMENTS IN EL SALVADOR.

   [REPORTER] TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER, THE FUNERAL RITES FOR THE THE
PRIESTS WHO WERE MURDERED IN SAN SALVADOR ARE TAKING PLACE AT THIS
MOMENT, AROUND NOON TIME, AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS WIFE ARE
ATTENDING THIS CEREMONY.  DO YOU HAVE ANY MESSAGE FOR THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, FOR THE STUDENTS FROM THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY, FOR THE
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL, WHO ARE MOURNING THE
DEATH OF THESE WORTHY JESUITS?

   [ROCA] WE HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED, AND I WILL REITERATE IT NOW, THE
DEEP SORROW OF THE FMLN MILITANTS AND THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL OVER THE
LOSS OF THESE WORTHY JESUIT PRIESTS WHO HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT
STRUGGLERS FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  WE SHARE THE
FEELINGS OF THE SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY.

   I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE PRESENCE OF CRISTIANI AT THE BURIAL
FOR THE JESUIT PRIESTS CALLS FOR A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OUTCRY
IN DEMAND FOR PUNISHMENT FOR THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
ATROCIOUS ASSASSINATION.

   CRISTIANI CANNOT GO TO THAT BURIAL AND DO NOTHING ABOUT PEOPLE TO
WHOM HE OPENED DOORS SO THAT THEY COULD COMMIT THESE KILLINGS.
EVERYBODY MUST DEMAND THAT CRISTIANI RESPOND TO THE PEOPLE'S
INDIGNATION BY PUNISHING THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME.
CRISTIANI CANNOT SPEAK ABOUT HAVING MORAL AUTHORITY FOR ATTENDING THAT
BURIAL UNLESS HE PUNISHES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE.  IT IS NOT
ENOUGH TO PUNISH THE ASSASSINS.  THERE MUST BE A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION OF THE WAVE OF CRIME THAT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED IN EL
SALVADOR.  THE MOST NOTORIOUS CRIME HAS BEEN THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT
PRIESTS, BUT IN THE PAST 8 DAYS MANY COMMON PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY
LEADERS HAVE ALSO BEEN MURDERED.  THE BOMBING HAS BEEN INTENSE.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE ENDURING MUCH PAIN AND THEY DEMAND THAT THE
PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT BE PUNISHED.

   WE AGAIN REITERATE THE PAIN OF THE PEOPLE OVER THE DEATH OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH MUST BRAVELY AND
LOUDLY DEMAND JUSTICE IN THE FACE OF THESE CRIMES.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 19 NOV 89 (ACAN) -- [EXCERPT] SAN SALVADOR,
19 NOV (ACAN-EFE) -- SALVADORAN CLERGYMEN FROM THE CATHOLIC, LUTHERAN,
AND BAPTIST CHURCHES HAVE CLAIMED THAT THEY ARE BEING "PERSECUTED" BY
GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY IN THE STYLE OF THE ULTRARIGHTIST
"DEATH SQUADS"

   MEDARDO GOMEZ, A LUTHERAN CHURCH BISHOP, SAID TODAY THAT CLERGYMEN
ARE SUBJECT TO "PERSECUTION."  HE SAID THAT MEMBERS OF THE POLICE
FORCE ARE "BESIEGING" SHELTERS ESTABLISHED BY THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO
BENEFIT THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS OF THE FIGHTING.

   THE LUTHERAN BISHOP SAID THAT SIX GERMANS, FOUR U.S. CITIZENS, A
CANADIAN, AND A SPANIARD WERE ARRESTED BY THE TREASURY POLICE 2 DAYS
AGO IN A CHURCH IN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE TROOPS WERE LOOKING FOR
"GUERRILLA COLLABORATORS."

   THE FOREIGNERS WERE DETAINED AFTER HAVING HELPED TO AID CIVILIANS
WHO TOOK REFUGE IN CHURCHES IN SAN SALVADOR AFTER FLEEING FROM THE
BLOODY CLASHES BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND REBELS IN THE MEJICANOS,
CUSCATANCINGO, ZACAMIL, CIUDAD DELGADO, SAN JACINTO, AND SOYAPANGO
NEIGHBORHOODS, LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE
CAPITAL.

   SEVERAL PRIESTS, INCLUDING DANIEL LOPEZ, A SPANIARD, HAD TO
EVACUATE THEIR PARISHES, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE EMBATTLED AREAS,
AFTER THE CHURCHES WERE SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS.  LOPEZ HAD TO LEAVE
THE SANTA MARIA DE LOS POBRES CHURCH IN THE LA CHACRA SLUM AREA IN
EASTERN SAN SALVADOR AFTER IT WAS BOMBED BY THE AIR FORCE, ACCORDING
TO ONE OF LOPEZ' ASSISTANTS, WHO IS ALSO A SPANIARD.

   RELIGIOUS SOURCES TOLD THE PRESS THAT TREASURY POLICEMEN ASSAULTED
SOME 50 REFUGEES IN THE SAN ROQUE SHELTER, LOCATED IN SOUTHERN SAN
SALVADOR, WHEN THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR A PRIEST NAMED CORTEZ.

   THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS SAID THAT THE PERSECUTION WAS STEPPED UP
AFTER THE START OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN THE CAPITAL, WHICH BEGAN
ON 11 NOVEMBER AND SO FAR HAS LEFT SOME 1,000 DEAD, INCLUDING 6 JESUIT
PRIESTS WHO WERE ASSASSINATED.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

FORCE PLANE WHICH LEFT THE COUNTRY AT 1545 (2145 GMT) FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AT COMALAPA.

   SPANISH DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER INOCENCIO ARIAS WAS ON BOARD THE
PLANE.

   THE AIRPLANE'S DEPARTURE WAS DELAYED TO WAIT FOR ARIAS AND OTHER

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE FOLLOWING IS AN
UPDATED REPORT OF THE MILITARY SITUATION.

   THE ARMED FORCES INFORM THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT THE AREAS IN SAN
SALVADOR WHERE ARMY TROOPS ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING COUNTERINSURGENCY
OPERATIONS ARE THE GUADALUPE AND LOS SANTOS NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE
SOYOPANGO MUNICIPALITY, AND SAN SEBASTIAN [WORD INDISTINCT] AT CIUDAD
DELGADO.  THE ARMED FORCES EXPECT TO EXPEL THE REMAINING SMALL REBEL
REDOUBTS FROM THESE AREAS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  THERE WERE
HARRASSMENT ACTIONS IN APOPA THIS MORNING, BUT NO CASUALTIES WERE
REPORTED.  THE ARMY CONTROLS THE MEJICANOS AND ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOODS.

   THE ARMED FORCES CONTROL THE SITUATION IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE
COUNTRY.  THE SITUATION IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY IS ALSO
UNDER CONTROL, EXCEPT FOR A FEW TERRORIST GROUPS CURRENTLY BEING
EXPELLED FROM THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL.

   THE ARMED FORCES JOINT COMMAND STAFF REPORTS THAT 840 TERRORISTS
HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 558 HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AS OF TODAY.  THE ARMY HAS
SUFFERED THE LOSS OF 220 SOLDIERS, WHO HEROICALLY OFFERED THEIR LIVES
TO DEFEND THE FATHERLAND FROM COMMUNISM.  ALSO, 457 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN
WOUNDED.

   THE FOLLOWING WAR MATERIEL HAS BEEN CONFICATED: 446 RIFLES OF
DIFFERENT CALIBERS, 87 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, [WORDS INDISTINCT], 22
MACHINEGUNS, 18 SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION AND
OTHER WAR MATERIEL.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT] [GENERAL
RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS, SALVADORAN DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY
MINISTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THIS IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY, THIS IS OUR
MISSION, AND WE ARE WILLING TO GIVE OUR LIVES IN SACRIFICE, AS HAS
BEEN PROVEN BY THE MANY HEROIC SOLDIERS WHO ARE DYING IN THIS STRUGGLE
TO DEFEND JUSTICE, PEACE, DEMOCRACY, AND THE WELL-BEING OF THESE
PEOPLE WHOM WE LOVE SO MUCH, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   ARMED FORCES, DO NOT FEAR THE ENEMY.  GO FORWARD WITH YOUR RESOLVE
AND SPIRIT.  OUR FAITH IN GOD AND OUR CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES GIVE US THE
TRUTH AND THE STRENGTH TO CONTINUE DESTROYING THE FORCES THAT ARE
TRYING TO WIPE OUT OUR HISTORY, TRADITION, VALUES, AND CITIZENS'
PRINCIPLES.

   FOR EACH OFFICER AND SOLDIER LOST IN THE STRUGGLE, THERE IS NO
OTHER MISSION BUT TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY, TO DESTROY THE TERRORISTS'
PLANS, AND TO ONCE AND FOR ALL WIPE OUT THIS MANEUVER, THIS ATTEMPT TO
DESTROY THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF EL SALVADOR.

   THIS IS A TIMELY OCCASION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, TO SAY THAT THE ARMED
FORCES AS AN INSTITUTION AT SOCIETY'S SERVICE DEEPLY REGRET AND HAVE
BEEN DISMAYED BY THE INCIDENTS AT THE JOSE SIMEON CANAS CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.  WE CONDEMN, POINT AT, AND DEEPLY REJECT THESE
IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT ACTIONS, WHICH ARE AIMED AGAINST SALVADORAN
INTELLECTUALS.  WE, LIKE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, ALSO POINT TO, QUESTION, AND TOTALLY REJECT THESE ACTIONS
WHICH ONLY BRING MOURNING AND GRIEF AND, FURTHERMORE -- AS THE
TERRORIST FORCES HAVE DONE ON OTHER OCCASIONS -- CREATE CONFUSION,
DECEIT, AND FURTHER TORMENT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY
SUFFERED SO MUCH.

   THE ARMED FORCES CONVEY THEIR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL JESUIT COMMUNITY, AND WE ARE WILLING -- AS THE
GOVERNMENT HAS POINTED OUT -- TO CARRY OUT THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS, SO
THAT SOONER OR LATER WE WILL FIND THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SITUATION
AND APPLY TO THEM THE PUNISHMENT THEY DESERVE FOR SUCH IRRATIONAL,
VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT ONLY BRING GRIEF, TEARS, AND BLOOD TO OUR
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, I BELIEVE THE TIME HAS COME TO FURTHER
DEMONSTRATE OUR STOICISM.  I BELIEVE THIS IS THE TIME TO DEFINE, IN A
TRUE CITIZEN'S SPIRIT, OUR RESOLVE TO DEFEAT, OUR RESOLVE TO WIN.
WITHIN A SHORT WHILE, A FEW HOURS, OR A FEW DAYS, WE WILL JOIN THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO CELEBRATE THE VICTORY OF DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND
PEACE OVER THE IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE UNLEASHED BY THE FMLN.

   THIS MAY ALSO BE A TIMELY OPPORTUNITY TO POINT TO THE TERRORIST
FORCES THAT ARE STILL TRYING TO HURT OUR CIVILIAN POPULATION, TO TELL
THEM THAT THEIR CAUSE, THE CAUSE OF VIOLENCE, IRRATIONALITY, AND
DISRESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE'S WILL, IS LOST.  TO THIS EFFECT, THE ARMED
FORCES ARE URGING THE TERRORIST FORCES TO SURRENDER, TO LAY DOWN THEIR
WEAPONS, TO STOP THE VIOLENCE, AND TO JOIN CIVILIAN LIFE IN SOCIETY,
IN PEACE AND HARMONY, SO THAT WE ALSO -- AS THE ARMED FORCES AND AS AN
INSTITUTION -- CAN RESPECT THEIR LIVES AND INCORPORATE THEM INTO
SOCIETY, AND SO THAT TOGETHER -- TODAY, TOMORROW, AND ALWAYS -- WE CAN
BUILD A COUNTRY FULL OF LOVE, WELL- BEING, PEACE, AND FAITH IN GOD.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] EDUARDO COLORADO,
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF EL SALVADOR, STATED TODAY THAT THERE IS A PLAN,
POSSIBLY PREPARED BY THE GUERRILLAS, TO ATTACK SALVADORAN BISHOPS AND
"CREATE GREATER PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT" OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE OFFICIAL SAID THAT "IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE
FOR THE BISHOPS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OR NOT APPEAR IN PUBLIC."

   COLORADO, WHO DID NOT WANT WANT TO PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT
THE ALLEGED PLAN, SAID THAT THE MAIN TARGET MIGHT BE MSGR GREGORIO
ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SINCE SEVERAL OF HIS
RELATIVES ARE GUERRILLAS.

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT PERSONS
WHO HAVE LOST RELATIVES IN THE WAR "MIGHT CARRY OUT THE PLAN" THAT
"MIGHT BE ORGANIZED BY THE TERRORISTS TO CREATE A GREATER CRISES FOR
THE GOVERNMENT."

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID HE SENT A LETTER TO POPE JOHN PAUL II
ASKING HIM TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY THE BISHOPS WHO REPORTEDLY
SUPPORT THE SO-CALLED "PEOPLE'S CHURCH."  ACCORDING TO COLORADO, THIS
"PEOPLE'S CHURCH" IS RESPONSIBLE IN PART FOR THE VIOLENCE IN THE
COUNTRY.

   HE DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH BISHOPS ARE MENTIONED IN THE LETTER SENT
TO THE POPE, BUT VARIOUS SOURCES INSIST HE IS REFERRING TO ARCHBISHOP
ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS AND AUXILIARY BISHOP ROSA CHAVEZ, WHO SUPPORT A
POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.

   IN THE LETTER, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUGGESTS THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II
REMOVE THESE SALVADORAN BISHOPS SINCE, HE INSISTS, "IT IS 1,000 TIMES
BETTER TO PREVENT THESE INCIDENTS THAN TO HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THEM."

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S LETTER TO THE POPE WAS SENT 2 DAYS AFTER SIX
JESUITS (FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN) AND TWO WOMEN WERE KILLED
IN SAN SALVADOR BY A GROUP OF 30 TO 40 MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS,
ACCORDING TO WITNESSES.  


DEV-MUC3-0821 (PRC)

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE ARMED FORCES
MAINTAIN CONTROL IN THE CAPITAL.  AFTER 6 [NUMBER AS HEARD] DAYS OF INTENSE
BATTLES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE SHOWN
THEIR PROFESSIONALISM BY ACHIEVING TOTAL CONTROL IN THE CAPITAL.  THE
LOCATIONS WHERE THERE WERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS -- THE SLOPES OF SAN JACINTO
HILL IN THE SOUTH AND SOYAPANGO, CIUDAD DELGADO, MEJICANOS, AND ZACAMIL --
HAVE BEEN RETAKEN BY THE ARMY DURING THE WEEKEND.  EVEN THOUGH THE ARMY HAD
DISLODGED THE MARXIST - LENINISTS FROM MEJICANOS, CIVILIAN ACCESS TO THAT
AREA HAS NOT BEEN PERMITTED BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS MINED THE ENTRANCES TO
SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND SEVERAL HOUSES OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT COOPERATE
WITH THEM.  IN CIUDAD DELGADO, ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS FOUGHT SMALL GROUPS OF
GUERRILLAS WHO HAD HIDDEN IN HOUSES AND WHO PUT UP SOME RESISTANCE, WHICH
WAS QUICKLY CONTROLLED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  THE ARMED FORCES MAINTAIN
ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER AMATEPEC AND CIUDAD CREDISA NEIGHBORHOODS.

   ONWARD BRAVE SOLDIERS.  CONTINUE FIGHTING TO KEEP OUR FATHERLAND
FREE WITH GUARANTEES FOR ALL HONEST SALVADORANS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
CAPITAL, WHICH HAS BEEN THE SCENE OF FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN ARMY AND GUERRILLAS OVER THE PAST WEEK, IS SLOWLY RETURNING
TO NORMAL.  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 9 DAYS MANY BUSINESSES AND
WORKPLACES OPENED THEIR DOORS AND MANY BUSES WERE OPERATING.  AFTER
MANY DAYS IN WHICH MOST VEHICLES ON THE STREETS WERE AMBULANCES,
OFFICIAL OR MILITARY VEHICLES, AND VEHICLES BELONGING TO NEWSMEN, THE
CAPITAL AWAKENED TODAY TO HEAVY TRAFFIC WITH BUSES, TAXIS, TRUCKS, AND
PRIVATE VEHICLES.

   THE 24-HOUR "CURFEW" DECREED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN THE DENSELY
POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CUSCATANCINGO, AND MEJICANOS
IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR WAS SUSPENDED, SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT AFLREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT.

   THE "STATE OF SIEGE" AND "CURFEW," HOWEVER, WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT,
FROM 1800 IN THE EVENING UNTIL 0600 IN THE MORNING.

   IN TWO OUTLYING NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL, GUERRILLA REDOUBTS
AND SOLDIERS HAVE CONTINUED TO CLASH, PARTICULARLY IN THE
NEIGHBORHOODS OF APOPA, CIUDAD DELGADO, AND SOYAPANGO.

   PRIVATE VEHICLES CANNOT OPERATE IN MUCH OF MEJICANOS NEIGHBORHOOD,
ONE OF THE MAIN GUERRILLA BASTIONS LAST WEEK, AS A RESULT OF THE
TRENCHES DUG BY THE REBELS AND DEBRIS PILED ON THE STREETS FROM
DESTROYED BUILDINGS AND HOMES.

   THE SITUATION IS ALSO RETURNING TO NORMAL IN SOME PARTS OF THE
INTERIOR, EXCEPT FOR SOME CITIES SUCH AS SAN MIGUEL IN THE EAST AND
ZACATECOLUCA IN THE SOUTH WHERE THERE IS STILL FIERCE FIGHTING IN
WHICH ELITE ARMY UNITS ARE INVOLVED.

   IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THE RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANTARIAN ASSISTANCE
ORGANIZATIONS ARE BEGINNING THE TASKS OF CLEANING UP THE RUBBLE AND
REBUILDING THOUSANDS OF HOMES AFFECTED BY THE FIGHTING AND BOMBING,
ACCORDING TO THE PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENTS.  INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS
SOURCES SAID THAT SOME 50,000 PERSONS HAVE HAD TO ABANDON THEIR HOMES
AND ARE LODGED IN CHURCHES, STADIUMS, SCHOOLS, AND OTHER BUILDINGS SET
UP AS TEMPORARY LODGINGS.

   INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE HAS ALSO BEGUN TO ARRIVE
BRINGING FIRST AID FOR THE MANY CIVILIANS WHO WERE WOUNDED AND ARE
BEING TREATED IN THE HOSPITALS WHERE HUNDREDS OF THE MORE THAN 1,000
WHO WERE TREATED LAST WEEK REMAIN, ACCORDING TO SALVADORAN HOSPITAL
SOURCES.

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANO REPORTED ON A RADIO AND TELEVISION
NETWORK THAT "A FEW REDOUBTS" GUERRILLA REDOUBTS REMAIN, THAT THE
ARMED FORCES HAVE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE, AND THAT "THE SITUATION WILL
BE TOTALLY CONTROLLED SOON."

   HE SAID THAT THE WAR VICTIMS WILL BE GIVEN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE AND
THAT HIS CABINET WILL IMPLEMENT "RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS," WITH WHICH
HE INVITED THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO COOPERATE.

   THE STATE RADIO IS CELEBRATING THE "DEFEAT OF THE RED HORDES" OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IN A TONE OF
RESOUNDING VICTORY, CONSTANTLY RENDERING TRIBUTE TO THE LEADERS AND
SOLDIERS OF THE BATTALIONS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN EXPELLING THE
GUERRILLAS FROM THE CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES.

   "THE TERRORISTS FLED IN DISARRAY," ACCORDING TO THE STATE RADIO,
WHICH COMMENTED ON THE MILITARY SITUATION THAT CIRCLES CLOSE TO THE
FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] INTERPRETED
AS A "TACTICAL WITHDRAWAL."

   THE FIGHTING AND BOMBINGS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY HAVE LEFT A TOLL OF MORE THAN 1,000 DEAD, HUNDREDS WOUNDED,
AND TENS OF THOUSANDS HOMELESS.


DEV-MUC3-0823 (PRC)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] A FRIEND OF
THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE FIRST TO ARRIVE ON THE SCENE, SAID THAT HE
COUNTED SOME 500 OR 600 BULLET HOLES.  HE SAID THAT THESE SHOTS WERE
FIRED FROM SOME DISTANCE, WITH A MACHINEGUN SET UP ON A TRIPOD.  THE
PRIESTS WERE ALSO LATER SHOT IN A GARDEN NEARBY.  ACCORDING TO
INFORMATION THAT THE SOCIETY OF JESUS RECEIVED FOLLOWING THEIR OWN
RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CRIME, WHICH THEY HAVE RELEASED TO THE
AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING THE CASE, THE KILLERS, APPROXIMATELY 30 MEN
IN UNIFORM, ARRIVED SHORTLY BEFORE 0230.  THEY MACHINEGUNNED THE HOUSE
BEFORE ENTERING, DRAGGED THE PRIESTS OUT, PUT THEM IN FRONT OF A WALL
THAT IS STILL STAINED WITH BLOOD, AND SHOT THEM.  THE PRIESTS WERE
ALSO SHOT IN THE HEAD WITH A LONG-RANGE WEAPON; HOWEVER, THESE SHOTS
WERE FIRED FROM SOME DISTANCE.  A LAWYER, HELPING IN THE INVESTIGATION
OF THIS CASE AND WHO HAS ASKED TO REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, SAID THAT THIS
WAS DETERMINED BECAUSE THERE WERE NO GUNPOWDER MARKS ON THE VICTIMS.

   AT THE TIME THE CRIME WAS CARRIED OUT, A CURFEW WAS BEING OBSERVED
THROUGHOUT THE CITY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND THE HOUSE WHERE THE
PRIESTS LIVED WAS SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS.  TOGETHER WITH THIS
INFORMATION, GATHERED BY SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROMINENT PERSONS TO
PROVE THAT THE MURDER WAS CARRIED OUT BY SOLDIERS, WE MUST STRESS THAT
THE HOUSE WAS ALSO SEARCHED BY THE SOLDIERS 2 DAYS BEFORE THE CRIME
WAS COMMITTED.  A JESUIT PRIEST WHO WAS DESCRIBING THE SCENE SAID THAT
ONLY THE AREA PREVIOUSLY SEARCHED BY THE SOLDIERS WAS DESTROYED.  HE
SAID THAT THE LIBRARY WAS BURNED AND THE ROOMS HAD BEEN RANSACKED.
ACCORDING TO THE PRIEST, $5,000 THAT FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA HAD
RECEIVED IN BARCELONA -- PART OF AN AWARD GIVEN THE UNIVERSITY -- WERE
TAKEN FROM ONE OF THE ROOMS.

   THE USE OF LONG-RANGE WEAPONS WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN WHY THE BRAINS OF
THE DEAD WERE SCATTERED ABOUT.  THIS WAS SEEN BY THE FIRST PERSONS WHO
ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.  OTHERS SAID THAT THE BODIES WERE DESTROYED
BECAUSE AK-47 AND M-16 ASSAULT RIFLES WERE USED IN THE ATTACK.  THE
BODIES WERE SO UTTERLY DESTROYED THAT EMBALMING WAS NOT POSSIBLE.
THIS WAS REPORTED TO ACAN-EFE BY SOCIETY OF JESUS SUPERIOR JOSE MARIA
TOJEIRA.

   REGARDING THE TWO MURDERED WOMEN, THE COOK ELBA JULIA RAMOS AND HER
15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MARISELA, ALL INDICATES THAT THEY WERE
MACHINEGUNNED IN THE SMALL ROOM WHERE THEY SLEPT. THERE WAS SO MUCH
BLOOD THAT IT SEEPED UNDER THE DOOR, AND A VERTEBRA AND PIECES OF A
SKULL CAN STILL BE SEEN UNDER A SOFA IN THE SMALL ROOM.  THE
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE VICTIMS WERE NOT
TORTURED AS EARLIER REPORTS HAD STATED.

   MEANWHILE, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REPORTEDLY SAID
YESTERDAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND HAS NOT RULED OUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE KILLERS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS COULD HAVE BEEN
SOLDIERS.  THEY HAVE NOT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOLDIERS COULD
HAVE KILLED THE PRIESTS, AND THEY ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE
INCIDENT AND PUNISH THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.  THIS WAS SAID BY THE
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT IN STATEMENTS TO ACAN-EFE AND OTHER FOREIGN NEWS
AGENCIES.  CRISTIANI, WHO INSISTED ON THE NEED TO AVOID UNFOUNDED
CONCLUSIONS, ADDED THAT THE MILITARY DOES NOT THINK IT WILL BE
AFFECTED BY SOMETHING DONE BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION.

   WE CAN CLEARLY SEE NOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CONTRADICTIONS.  AT THIS
MOMENT THERE ARE THREE POSITIONS.  THERE IS THE POSITION OF U.S.
AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER -- HE IS LIKE AN OSTRICH WITH ITS HEAD
BURIED IN THE SAND.  THERE IS PROOF THAT RULES OUT ALL DOUBT.  HOW CAN
40 MEN IN UNIFORM BE IN A MILITARIZED AREA FOR 60 MINUTES AND NOT HEAR
SHOTS BEING FIRED AND BOMBS EXPLODING?  WHY DID THE ARMY NOT SEND IN
TROOPS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED ONLY A FEW BLOCKS FROM COLONEL RENE
EMILIO PONCE'S OFFICE?  THE 40 MEN WERE IN THE AREA FOR A WHOLE HOUR.
THEY HAD ALREADY SEARCHED FATHER ELLACURIA'S HOME.

   OUR QUESTION FOR WILLIAM WALKER: IF THIS WAS NOT DONE BY THE ARMED
FORCES, THEN WHY WERE THEY THERE SEARCHING THE PREMISES FOR A WHOLE
HOUR AND EVEN STEALING $5,000?  THEY SEARCHED DRAWER BY DRAWER.  THE
DISORDER THEY LEFT BEHIND WAS QUITE EVIDENT IN THE CLIPS SHOWN ON
TELEVISION.  THEY SEARCHED THE AREA FOR AN HOUR TO SEE WHAT THEY, THE
MURDERERS, COULD FIND TO STEAL.  HOWEVER, AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER
SAYS THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IF THE ARMY COMMITTED THE CRIME.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0824 (PRC)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] AS WE SAID EARLIER, THERE ARE THREE POSITIONS.  THIS
PROVES THAT THERE ARE CONTRADICTIONS SURROUNDING THIS CASE.  THERE IS
WILLIAM WALKER, ACTING LIKE AN OSTRICH WITH HIS HEAD STUCK IN THE
GROUND.  AND THERE IS CRISTIANI'S POSITION -- THE DEATH SQUAD MEMBER
WHO WEARS A TIE, WHO [WORDS INDISTINCT] AFTER THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND WHO SAID THAT RASH JUDGMENT SHOULD
NOT BE PASSED AND THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE IN A HURRY TO ACCUSE THE
GOVERNMENT OR ANYONE ELSE.  AND THERE IS ALSO THE GENERAL STAFF AND
DEFENSE MINISTRY POSITION BLAMING THE FMLN.  WHY?  IF IT IS TRUE THAT
THERE IS A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IN EL SALVADOR, THEN WHY CAN THE
DEFENSE MINISTER APPEAR BEFORE THE TELEVISION CAMERAS CONTRADICTING
CRISTIANI, GOING AGAINST WHAT CRISTIANI HAD SAID?  WHO GIVES THE
ORDERS HERE, LARIOS OR CRISTIANI?  IF CRISTIANI GIVES THE ORDERS, THEN
THE DEFENSE MINISTER MUST OBEY CRISTIANI AND REFRAIN FROM MAKING
ACCUSATIONS BEFORE A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION IS HELD.  HOWEVER, THIS IS
NOT THE CASE.

   THIS FURTHER PROVES WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING.  THE CIVILIAN MASK
FELL ON SATURDAY.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY HOLDS THE REAL POWER IN THE
COUNTRY.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CENSORS THE PRESS.  THE SOLDIERS ARE
THE ONES CENSORING THE TELEVISION STATIONS, AND NOT THE ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] FOLLOWERS OR OTHER
CIVILIANS.  THE GENERAL STAFF, THE SOLDIERS, ARE GAGGING THE PRESS,
IMPOSING THE STATE OF SIEGE, GIVING THE FINAL ORDERS.  IT IS IMPORTANT
TO LOOK INTO THIS CLOSELY BECAUSE GEN LARIOS, IN AN EMPTY SPEECH -- WE
HEARD HIM DELIVER A RHETORICAL AND EMPTY SPEECH -- ACCUSED THE FMLN OF
KILLING THE PRIESTS AND SAID THAT THE ARMY CONTROLS THE COUNTRY.  WE
POINT OUT THESE CONTRADICTIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   BY SAYING THAT THEY DID NOT DO IT, THAT THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT DO
IT, THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADMITTED THAT HE DID IT, THAT HE IS ONE OF
THE KILLERS.  THAT IS WHAT GEN LARIOS IS SAYING, THAT IS WHAT HE SAID
IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENT.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] NO DOUBT, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN
THE GOVERNMENT'S INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE PAST EXAMPLES OF IT.
WE HAVE MONSIGNOR ROMERO'S CASE AND WE HAVE THE CASE OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, WHO, A FEW YEARS AGO, WERE
ARRESTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT DURING A POLICE OPERATION.  HOWEVER, NOT A
SINGLE SOLDIER HAS BEEN PUNISHED.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN CRISTIANI'S
JUSTICE.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS PUTTING ON THE PRESSURE AND
CRISTIANI WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.  HE WILL PROBABLY PUT UP SOME
ACT.  THE U.S.  CONGRESS ALSO HAS ITS EYES ON EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE
DEBATING THE ISSUE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR.  THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THE
U.S.  CONGRESS MUST THINK ABOUT.  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SAID
THAT IT IS PLEASED WITH THE WAY CRISTIANI ACTED IN THE FACE OF THE
FMLN OFFENSIVE.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS
APPROVED THE DROPPING OF WHITE PHOSPHORUS OVER ZACAMIL AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF 500 HOMES.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
STATE HAS APPROVED THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, AND ALSO THE
MASSACRE OF SEVERAL SALVADORAN CITIZENS WHO WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR
HOMES AND KILLED ON THE SAME BLACK NIGHT WHEN THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE
KILLED.

   CLANDESTINE, 20 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] HERE IS A VERY
IMPORTANT POINT THAT U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER SHOULD TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION.  AMBASSADOR WALKER SEEMS TO BE A VERY BAD INVESTIGATOR, AS HE
IS STILL IN THE DARK AS REGARDS THE COWARDLY MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.
AFTER THE FUNERAL OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR STILL EXPRESSED
DOUBTS REGARDING THE AUTHORS OF THIS CRIME.

   WELL, WE HAVE RECEIVED A REPORT STATING THAT THE MURDERERS OF THE
JESUITS FIRED MORE THAN 500 SHOTS AND STAYED IN THE RESIDENCE OF THE
SLAIN PRIESTS FOR 1 HOUR.  IN OTHER WORDS, 40 MEN IN THE UNIFORM OF
THE SALVADORAN ARMY WERE A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE GENERAL STAFF
PARTICIPATING IN SHOOTING THAT LASTED SEVERAL MINUTES, AND REMAINED IN
THERE FOR 1 HOUR, IN AN AREA UNDER THE ARMY'S CONTROL, IN AN AREA
UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE GENERAL STAFF.

   WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE U.S. AMBASSADOR.  HOW COULD 40 MEN IN
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES UNIFORMS, AND WITH POLICE AND ARMY PATROLS
ONLY A FEW METERS AWAY FROM THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE, REMAIN IN THAT
PLACE FOR 1 HOUR IF THEY WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES?

   AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF YOU STILL HAVE ANY SHAME, TELL THE
WORLD AND ANSWER THIS QUESTION: IF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF DID
NOT KILL THE JESUIT PRIESTS, HOW COULD THE MURDERERS -- AS THIS
INTERNATIONAL DISPATCH SAYS -- REMAIN IN THE RESIDENCE FOR 1 HOUR
AFTER THE HEAVY SHOOTING, AFTER KILLING THE PRIESTS WITH MACHINEGUNS
IN TRIPODS, AS THE CABLE SAYS?

   WE WILL READ THIS DISPATCH WHICH IS BEING READ ALL OVER THE WORLD.
MAYBE WILLIAM WALKER DOES NOT EVEN READ INTERNATIONAL DISPATCHES,
BECAUSE HE CYNICALLY SAID AFTER THE PRIESTS' FUNERAL THAT HE HAD NO
EVIDENCE OR INDICATION THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE ARMED
FORCES.  WELL, AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, WE WILL READ THIS DISPATCH
TO YOU:

   THE [WORD INDISTINCT] IN UNIFORM WHO KILLED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND
TWO COMPANIONS IN SAN SALVADOR ON THURSDAY FIRED MORE THAN 500 SHOTS
AND REMAINED AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME FOR ALMOST 1 HOUR.  WE REPEAT:
THEY WERE IN THE PRIESTS' RESIDENCE FOR ALMOST 1 HOUR, ACCORDING TO
PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS.

   A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE FUNERAL, THE SCENE OF THE CRIME REVEALS SOME
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONCERNING THE MACHINEGUNNING OF THE PRIESTS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE THREE SPANISH
MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, FREED TODAY BY THE
SALVADORAN NATIONAL GUARD, SAID THAT THE AUTHORITIES ORDERED THEM TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WERE SUSPECTED OF COLLABORATING WITH
"TERRORIST DELINQUENTS."

   "WE ARE BEING THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY," SAID FRANCES RIERA, ONE
OF THE SPANIARDS DETAINED THIS MORNING TOGETHER WITH HIS FELLOW
COUNTRYMEN ESTHER DOMENECH AND LUIS PEREZ, A GUATEMALAN UNDER REFUGE
AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH, AND ANOTHER THREE FOREIGNERS -- A COLOMBIAN,
A CANADIAN, AND AN AMERICAN.

   RIERA SAID THEY WERE DETAINED AT 1005 GMT, WHILE THE CITY WAS
"UNDER CURFEW" AND UNDER A "STATE OF SIEGE," AND THAT NATIONAL GUARD
MEMBERS "KNOCKED ON THE DOOR, ENTERED, SEPARATED US, TOOK THE
FOREIGNERS ASIDE, AND DELIVERED US AN ANTICOMMUNIST HARANGUE."

   "THEY TOLD US THEY WERE ARRESTING US FOR OUR OWN PROTECTION BECAUSE
FOREIGNERS WERE BEING THREATENED BY TERRORIST DELINQUENTS.  AT THE
NATIONAL GUARD WE WERE MADE TO SIGN A STATEMENT IN WHICH WE APPEAR AS
SUSPECTS OF COLLABORATING WITH TERRORIST DELINQUENTS," RIERA ADDED.

   THE THREE SPANIARDS ARE AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY, AFTER AMBASSADOR
FRANCISCO CADIZ IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO ACTION TO GET THEM FREED.

   A TOTAL OF 15 PEOPLE WERE DETAINED, NINE OF THEM SALVADORANS, AND
WE "KNOW NOTHING OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS," RIERA SAID.  HE ADDED THAT
THEY HAD REMAINED IN DETENTION FOR OVER 1 HOUR, STRESSING THAT "WE
WERE NEVER MISTREATED NOR WERE WE ASKED ANY QUESTIONS."

   RIERA SAID THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 135 PEOPLE AT THE EPISCOPAL
CHURCH WHO WERE LEFT HOMELESS BY THE WAR, AND MORE ARE EXPECTED TODAY.

   "PEOPLE HAVE TO REMAIN THERE (AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH) BECAUSE THEY
HAVE NO PLACE TO GO.  THERE ARE NO PLACES LEFT AFTER THE SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE BOMBINGS," RIERA STRESSED.

   HE ADDED THAT THE CHURCH "HAS EVIDENCE THAT WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS
WERE SET ON FIRE."

   RIERA REPORTED THAT AT THE END OF AUGUST "ARMED MEN, DRESSED IN
MILITARY UNIFORMS," ENTERED HIS HOME AND "INTIMIDATED US."

   THE THREE FREED SPANIARDS WILL RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO
MADRID, VIA GUATEMALA, A SPOKESMAN FOR THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN SAN

   WASHINGTON DC (UNITED STATES), 21 NOV 89 (MOSCOW TASS) -- [TEXT]
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES INTENDS TO
CONTINUE MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID TO EL SALVADOR, THE SCENE OF FIERCE
CLASHES RECENTLY BETWEEN SALVADOREAN INSURGENTS AND THE PRO-AMERICAN
REGIME'S ARMY.

   SPEAKING AT THE ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, MARYLAND, ON MONDAY, THE
PRESIDENT STRONGLY CRITICISED THE PREVAILING CONGRESSIONAL SENTIMENTS
IN FAVOUR OF THE TERMINATION OF AID TO THE SALVADOREAN GOVERNMENT.

   "THIS CONCEPT OF THE CONGRESS, OF SOME MEMBERS -- TALKING ABOUT
CUTTING OFF AID TO EL SALVADOR IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE TO ME AS
PRESIDENT." HE SAID.

   "WE SUPPORT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIS EFFORTS TO RESTORE ORDER,"
BUSH SAID.

   THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT, FIGHTING FOR NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY, OF BEING
FINANCED BY "MARXISTS".  MEANWHILE THE VOLUME OF WASHINGTON'S MILITARY
AND ECONOMIC AID TO THE SALVADOREAN REGIME IS KNOWN TO EXCEED 1.5
MILLION DOLLARS.

   "TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A HANDFUL OF COUNTRIES AROUND -- A VERY SMALL
HANDFUL -- SUPPORTING THE OUTDATED CONCEPT OF MARXIST GUERRILLAS, IS
UNACCEPTABLE TO THE UNITED STATES," THE PRESIDENT SAID.  "AND I AM TO
TELL THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES THAT I WILL NOT ACCEPT, AS
PRESIDENT, A CUT OFF OF AID TO EL SALVADOR," HE SAID.

   THE PRESIDENT SAID "WE CANNOT CONDONE KILLING" IN EL SALVADOR,
IGNORING THE FACT THAT THE NOTORIOUS "DEATH SQUADS", PARAMILITARY
EXTREME RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS, HAVE KILLED SCORES OF THOUSANDS OF
CIVILIANS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.  CIVILIANS, SUSPECTED OF LINKS WITH
GUERRILLAS, ARE IMMEDIATELY EXECUTED, THE AMERICAN PRESS HAS REPORTED.

   ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, THERE ARE 55 AMERICAN MILITARY
ADVISERS IN EL SALVADOR, SOME OF THEM INVOLVED IN TERRORISTIC "DEATH
SQUAD" OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS MANY U.S. SECRET SERVICE EMPLOYEES.

FERNANDO CASTRO, A MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT WHO RESIDES IN CUBA, BY JOURNALIST ROBERTO AGUDO] [TEXT] [AGUDO]
WELL, WE BELIEVE THAT TODAY IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR THE
REMARKS OF COMRADE CASTRO OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] IN THIS PROGRAM.  I CONSIDER IT PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT
BECAUSE THE LATEST REPORTS WE ARE RECEIVING STATE THAT THE GUERRILLAS
ARE CARRYING OUT A TACTICAL RETREAT, A TACTICAL REDEPLOYMENT.  I WOULD
LIKE TO ASK YOU, CASTRO, WHAT THE OBJECTIVES BEHIND THIS TACTICAL
RETREAT OR REDEPLOYMENT OF THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT ARE.

   [CASTRO) FOLLOWING 10 DAYS OF FIGHTING IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE
COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY IN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE REGIME CONDUCTED
CRIMINAL BOMBINGS, GOING AS FAR AS USING PHOSPHOROUS BOMBS, AND TO
AVOID FURTHER LOSS OF CIVILIAN LIVES, THAT IS, OF PEOPLE DIRECTLY
INVOLVED IN THE FIGHTING, THE FMLN HAS DECIDED TO CARRY OUT A TACTICAL
RETREAT IN ORDER TO CONCENTRATE ITS FORCES TO CONTINUE TO STRIKE IN
OTHER PLACES AGAINST THE ENEMY: THE SALVADORAN ARMY.

   [AGUDO] CASTRO, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE POLITICAL-MILITARY MANEUVER
HAS ALREADY ENDED?

   [CASTRO] NO. THE POLITICAL-MILITARY MANEUVER CONTINUES.  THE
OBJECTIVE IS TO OPEN AREAS FOR NEGOTIATIONS AND, IF POSSIBLE, TO
CREATE CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO DISLODGING THAT CRIMINAL
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS TODAY MAKING OUR PEOPLE SUFFER.

   [AGUDO] AFTER NEARLY 10 DAYS OF FIGHTING, DOES THE FMLN CONSIDER
THAT THE OPERATION HAS ACHIEVED ITS POLITICAL OBJECTIVE?

   [CASTRO] WE BELIEVE THAT THIS OPERATION HAS ACHIEVED SEVERAL
OBJECTIVES.  IN THE FIRST PLACE, WE HAVE SHOWN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND
THE WORLD OUR POLITICAL, MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC CAPABILITIES.  THE
ENEMY CLAIMED THAT WE ARE WEAK.  THEY EVEN STATED THAT IT WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FMLN TO HOLD A POSITION IN SAN SALVADOR FOR 1 DAY.
WE HAVE HELD MORE THAN 10 POSITIONS FOR 10 DAYS AND THEY HAD TO USE
ALL OF THE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS DELIVERED TO THEM BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT TO FORCE US TO RETREAT, TO CARRY OUT A TACTICAL MANEUVER IN
ORDER TO AVOID MORE DEATHS AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTIONS
IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL ITSELF.

   [AGUDO] WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ONE THING: THERE IS A GROUP OF
GUERRILLA FIGHTERS, OF REBEL FORCES THAT ARE RETREATING FROM THE
CAPITAL.  ISN'T THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN A POSITION TO SURROUND THEM, TO
ANNIHILATE THEM?

   [CASTRO] NO. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ARMY TO SURROUND OR TO
ANNIHILATE OUR COMRADES.  WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED OUR GREAT MANEUVERING
SKILLS IN THE COURSE OF THIS WAR.  WE HAVE TIME AND AGAIN BROKEN
SIEGES, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO ANNIHILATE US.  I REPEAT, WE
HAVE JUST RETREATED IN ORDER TO RELOCATE OUR FORCES IN PLACES THAT
WOULD ENABLE US TO DEAL EVEN HARDER BLOWS TO THE ENEMY.  [CONTINUED]

TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY:

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, CONSIDERING
THAT:

   1.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR A CEASE-FIRE, AS
REQUESTED BY THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL,
THE GROUP OF EIGHT, THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE EEC, CANADA, THE SOVIET
UNION, SWEDEN, AND FINLAND, IS A FAIR DEMAND FOR HUMANITARIAN AND
POLITICAL REASONS AND IS AIMED AT STOPPING THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIVES AS
WELL AS PREVENTING BLOODLETTING BETWEEN THE TWO SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES;

   2.  THE BRUTAL AERIAL AND ARTILLERY ATTACKS HAVE CAUSED MOSTLY
CIVILIAN VICTIMS IN THE LOW-INCOME DISTRICTS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF
THOUSANDS OF HOMES;

   3.  A MANHUNT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED FOR THE LEADERS AND MEMBERS OF
TRADE UNIONS, RELIGIOUS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND OPPOSITION
POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN MURDERS, CAPTURES, SEARCHES,
AND PERSECUTION, THE EXTENT OF WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE, AND OTHER
VICTIMS OF THE PERSECUTION HAVE GONE UNDERGROUND OR LEFT THE COUNTRY,
GIVING RISE -- BECAUSE OF THESE ACTIONS PER SE AND THE CONCEALMENT OF
TRUTH -- TO A CLIMATE OF STATE TERRORISM;

   4.  A POSTPONEMENT OF THE CEASE-FIRE WOULD RESULT IN FURTHER DAMAGE
TO THE SALVADORAN POPULATION AND MORE ARMED CONFRONTATIONS, AND THIS
WOULD NOT ALLOW CONDITIONS TO BE CREATED TO END THE WAR IN THE CITIES,
THE COUNTRYSIDE, AND SAN SALVADOR'S METROPOLITAN AREA;

   5.  THERE ARE SECTORS IN THE ARMED FORCES, ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE], PCN [NATIONAL CONCILIATION PARTY], MAC [AUTHENTIC CHRISTIAN
MOVEMENT], AND IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WANT A PROLONGATION OF THE
WAR AND, THEREFORE, OPPOSE A CEASE-FIRE; AND

   6.  WE ARE ACTING WITH FLEXIBILITY, GUIDED BY THE NATION'S
PATRIOTIC INTERESTS, THE SITUATION OF TRUE EMERGENCY THAT HAS BEEN
CREATED, AND THE DESIRE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED
CONFLICT, AND BECAUSE OF THE SOCIAL, MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC
POLARIZATION, IT IS URGENT THAT ALL FORCES ACT SWIFTLY AND TAKE STEPS
TO PUT A DEFINITIVE END TO THE WAR,

   THEREFORE:

   1.  WE STATE OUR IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE OF A CEASE-FIRE UNDER
VERIFICATION BY THE UNITED NATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE DEMAND OF THE
POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND RELIGIOUS FORCES OF THE SALVADORAN NATION AND

SITUATION THAT HAS RESULTED FROM MILITARY ATTACKS LAUNCHED BY LEFT-WING
GUERRILLAS.

   CHEN YU-CHU, SPOKESMAN FOR THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS [MOFA],

NICARAGUA, THE LEFT-WING GUERRILLAS HAD LAUNCHED LARGE-SCALE MILITARY
ATTACKS ON SAN SALVADOR, THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, AND OTHER MAJOR
CITIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO FORCIBLY SUBVERT THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT.

ACTION," THE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN SAID.

   "WE BELIEVE THAT UNDER THE ABLE LEADERSHIP OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO FELEX CRISTIANI, PEACE, SECURITY AND PROSPERITY WILL BE

THAT THE ROC EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR HAS BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE

DEMANDING PEACE.  THIS IS NOT RIGHT.  IS THIS IS THE DEMOCRACY YOU PEOPLE
WANT TO EXIST HERE?  BUT YOU PEOPLE ARE WRONG, MR.  WALKER.  IT WILL BE
IMPOSSIBLE HERE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE A VOLCANO IN ERUPTION.  WHOEVER PUTS
HIS HAND IN THE FIRE WILL GET BURNED, MR.  WALKER.  STOP STICKING YOUR NOSE
INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S BUSINESS.  YOU SHOULD RATHER SEND AWAY, ONCE AND FOR
ALL, THOSE COUNTRYMEN OF YOURS WHO HAVE BEEN SENT HERE AS ADVISERS.  THEY
ARE ADVISERS, ALL RIGHT, BUT OF THE DEATH SQUADS.  I HAVE JUST ONE PIECE OF
ADVICE FOR YOU.  UNDERSTAND ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT WHOEVER PUTS HIS HAND IN
THE FIRE WILL GET BURNED.  THE LAVA OF THIS ERUPTING VOLCANO IS BOILING,
MR.  WALKER.  UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT TAKE ONE STEP BACK.  ALL
FOR PEACE.

   WE HAVE BEEN READING THE SUMMARY OF OUR NEWS MONITORING.  U.S.  PENTAGON
MILITARY OFFICIALS AND MANY NONMILITARY ANALYSTS ARE SURPRISED OVER WHAT
THEY CALL THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S OFFENSIVE
CAPABILITIES.  A REPORT STATES THAT PENTAGON OFFICIALS ARE VERY SURPRISED
OVER THE FMLN MANEUVERABILITY AND OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES.  THE FMLN ACTIONS
OF THE PAST DAYS HAS SPOILED ALL THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SALVADORAN
MILITARY MEN SENT TO U.S.  OFFICIALS CONTAINING INFORMATION ON THE FMLN
MANPOWER-WEAPONS RATIO AND OUR MILITARY ABILITY TO OPERATE.

   THE FMLN HAS NEVER LOST ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES.  SOME ANALYSTS VIEW
THE SALVADORAN WAR AS A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.  THAT IS A MISTAKE BECAUSE
THE SALVADORAN WAR IS NOT A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.  IT CANNOT BE VIEWED AS
IF IT WERE A REGULAR WAR SUCH AS THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.  EL SALVADOR IS LIVING
THROUGH CONFLICT THAT IS MAINLY SOCIAL IN NATURE, A CONFLICT THAT IS ROOTED
IN SOCIAL INJUSTICE.  THE FMLN DID NOT EMERGE FROM A MILITARY SCHOOL WITH A
REARGUARD IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, BUT IT IS MADE UP OF THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES.
FMLN COMBATANTS HAVE LEARNED TO FIGHT IN ACTUAL CLASHES.  THEY HAVE GAINED
GROUND INCH BY INCH; IT HAS ORGANIZED THE PEOPLE.  THE FMLN DOES NOT
FORCEFULLY RECRUIT PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, IT IS NOT PERIODICALLY RENEWING ITS
RANKS AS THE ARMY DOES THROUGH FORCEFUL RECRUITMENT.  TO THE FMLN, THE MAIN
GOAL IS TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE, TO GET AS CLOSE AS IT CAN TO THE PEOPLE.

   BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, SOCIAL INJUSTICE, AND LACK OF DEMOCRATIC
OPPORTUNITIES IN [EL] SALVADOR, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS HAVE NO OTHER
OPTION THAN TO TAKE UP ARMS AND FIGHT TO ACHIEVE BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS IN
THE FACE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BRUTAL REPRESSION, ECONOMIC INJUSTICE, AND
UNEMPLOYMENT.  TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS DECIDED TO
TAKE UP ARMS AND LEARN TO WAGE WAR BY FIGHTING DAIILY.  THAT IS THE HISTORY
OF THE FMLN.

   THEREFORE, IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT TWO ARMIES ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.
THE LOGISTICS APPARATUS OF THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT' [ARMED] FORCES IS NOT
COMPARABLE TO OUR FORCES.  THEY BRING TO OUR COUNTRY TONS OF BOMBS, RIFLES,
BOOTS, AND MATERIAL THROUGH PORTS AND MILITARY AIRPORTS.  ALTHOUGH THE
GOVERNMENTS OF NICARAGUA, CUBA, AND THE USSR COULD HELP THE FMLN, AS MANY
ARE SAYING, THE FIREPOWER OF OUR FORCES COULD NEVER BE COMPARED TO THE
ARMY'S.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN HAS OPENED IN ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE
[UNITED] STATES, THE NECESSARY WAYS FOR US TO OBTAIN OUR ARMS AND
AMMUNITION.  WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THIS.  HOW DOES THE FMLN LEARN TO FIGHT--
BY FIGHTING.  WE ARE NOW FIGHTING IN CITIES.  EVERY MILITARY ANALYST KNOWS
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIGHT IN URBAN AREAS.  THE FMLN FIGHTING IN SAN
SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, AND USULUTAN HAS SHOWN THE
ORGANIZATION'S TREMENDOUS ABILITY TO WEAR OUT THE ENEMY, TAKE AND HOLD
POSITIONS, AND MANEUVER IN THE CITY JUST AS IT HAS DONE IN RURAL AREAS.  THE
FMLN ABILITY HAS SURPRISED THE MILITARY ANALYSTS AT THE PENTAGON.  OUR FRONT
HAS ALWAYS HAD THIS ABILITY.  BUT NOW WE HAVE CHANGED OUR STRATEGY AND
TACTICS TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY PLANS.  THE [ARMED] FORCES HAVE A SPECIFIC PLAN
REGARDING THE ACTIONS BY PATROLS [WORDS INDISTINCT], SPECIAL OPERATIONS.
THE FMLN HAD TO CHANGE ITS STRATEGY TO STRIKE AT THE SMALL FORCES THAT TRIED
TO INFILTRATE OUR ZONE UNDER COVER.  ONLY THUS COULD WE ANNIHILATE AND
DEFEAT THESE FORCES AND THEIR STRATEGY.  AND THIS IS WHAT WE DID.  THIS IS
WHAT MUST BE OBSERVED, HOW THE FMLN HAS CHANGED ITS MILITARY STRATEGY TO
FACE THE ONE USED BY THE [ARMED] FORCES.  OF COURSE, WE HAVE ACCUMULATED
GREAT EXPERIENCE OVER THE YEARS, WHICH WE HAVE APPLIED THESE LAST DAYS IN
COMBAT IN [SAN] SALVADOR AND [SAN] MIGUEL.  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS ARE
BEING DESTROYED IN STREETS AND AVENUES; HELICOPTERS ARE BEING SHOT DOWN;
SOLDIERS ARE BEING TAKEN PRISONER; AND ARMS ARE BEING SEIZED.

    MILITARY ANALYSTS ARE WONDERING HOW A GUERRILLA ARMY CAN OPERATE FOR SO
LONG IN AN URBAN AREA.  IN ADDITION, LOGISTICS MUST BE TAKEN INTO
CONSIDERATION.  THE [ARMED] FORCES ARE CONSTANTLY GETTING AMMUNITION THROUGH
THE ILOPANGO [AIR] BASE.  THE FMLN HAS BEEN ABLE TO CARRY OUT THIS OPERATION
BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT.  THOUSANDS OF CAPITAL RESIDENTS COOPERATED
BY KEEPING SILENT WHEN THEY SAW THE GUERRILLA COLUMNS PASS BY.  THEY DID NOT
WARN THE [ARMED] FORCES.  WHY?  BECAUSE THE PEOPLE SEE IN THESE GUERRILLA
COLUMNS THEIR OWN ARMY.

NATIONA LIBERATION FRONT] OFFENSIVE.  THE MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT IF THERE
HAS BEEN DRASTIC ACTION AGAINST THE FMLN REBELS, IT HAS ONLY BEEN TO DEFEND
THE CIVILIANS FROM WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A FOREIGN AGGRESSION.  IN THIS WAY,
GEN BUSTILLO REPLIED TO STATEMENTS BY SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA
Y DAMAS, WHO SAID THE ARMY'S RESPONSE TO THE FMLN OFFENSIVE IN SAN SALVADOR
WAS EXCESSIVE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSTILLO] MANY COMMENTS CAN BE MADE BUT WHAT MUST BE
ASKED IS WHY DID THE REBELS SEEK THE URBAN AREAS?  WHAT IS THEIR
JUSTIFICATION?  THAT IS THE CONDEMNABLE ASPECT.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND
THE MEDIA SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED ABOUT WHETHER WE ACTED STRONGLY AS MSGR
RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID.  IT IS TRUE WE HAVE BEEN STRONG AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO
BE STRONG.  BUT WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE TERRORISTS BEGAN THE ACTION,
THAT IS HOW THE PROBLEM BEGAN.  THAT IS WHAT MUST BE JUDGED AND NOT HOW WE
REACTED. [END RECORDING]

   GEN BUSTILLO SAID THE MAIN ROLE OF THE AIR FORCE IS THE DEFENSE OF
THE FATHERLAND.  HE ADDED: THERE IS NO ROOM HERE FOR GUERRILLAS AND
MUCH LESS FOR THOSE OF THE FMLN WHO CALL THEMSELVES DEFENDERS OF THE
PEOPLE.  GEN BUSTILLO SAID THIS FMLN OFFENSIVE WAS NOT PREPARED IN THE
LAST FEW DAYS.  INSTEAD, HE SAID, IT MUST HAVE BEEN PREPARED AT LEAST
18 MONTHS AGO.  HE SAID IT HAS TAKEN TIME TO OUST THE REBELS BECAUSE
THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT WANTED TO HARM THE CIVILIAN POPULATION,
AMONG WHICH THE INSURGENTS HID.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSTILLO] IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO ANNIHILATE THESE
TERRORISTS WHEN THEY TAKE PEOPLE AS HOSTAGES. THAT IS WHY FOR YEARS THEY
BEGAN INFILTRATING AND ESTABLISHING THE MEANS TO USE THE PEOPLE AS A COVER.
WE CAN SEE THAT WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE VILLAGES
FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS, THEY HAVE NOW CARRIED OUT HERE IN SAN SALVADOR AND
OTHER BIG CITIES.  THEY HAVE TAKEN COVER BEHIND THE PEOPLE, AND THAT IS WHY
IT HAS BEEN VERY HARD AND DIFFICULT FOR US TO ANNIHILATE THEM.  WE HAD TO BE
CAREFUL SO AS TO CAUSE THE LEAST HARM TO THE PEOPLE. [END RECORDING]

   HE ALSO SAID THE SEIZURE OF THE SHERATON HOTEL IS AN ISOLATED
INCIDENT THAT ONLY SEEKS INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.  BUSTILLO SAID A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION HAS JUST BEEN A GAME FOR THE REBELS SO NO ONE IN
EL SALVADOR SHOULD CONSIDER IT AS A SOLUTION TO A 10-YEAR-OLD WAR THAT
HAS LEFT MORE THAN 60,000 DEAD.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSTILLO] THE DIALOGUE AND A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION HAVE
BEEN A TACTIC USED BY THE FMLN FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  WE CAN NOW CLEARLY SEE
THAT NEITHER THE PEOPLE, ARMED FORCES, NOR THE POLITICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER
THEM AS AN ALTERNATIVE.  IT CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN THAT ALL THIS TIME DURING
WHICH SOME INDIVIDUALS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN SEEKING A SOLUTION THROUGH DIALOGUE, THE FMLN HAD
JUST BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS OFFENSIVE. [END RECORDING]

   ASKED WHAT PLANS THE ARMED FORCES HAVE IN THE FACE OF ANOTHER FMLN
OFFENSIVE, THE GENERAL WAS EMPHATIC:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSTILLO] ANNIHILATE THEM.  ANNIHILATE THEM.  THAT IS
THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO. [END RECORDING]

   THE GENERAL MADE THESE STATEMENTS TO THIS NEWSCAST AFTER HE LISTED
THE WEAPONS THAT WERE SEIZED AND THE CASUALTIES SUSTAINED BY THE ARMY.
BUSTILLO SAID FOUR OFFICERS OF THE PARATROOPERS BATTALION WERE KILLED
AND SEVERAL WERE WOUNDED.  HE SAID 20 SOLDIERS DIED IN THE MILITARY
ACTIONS [TIME FRAME NOT SPECIFIED].

   BOGOTA, 23 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] GENERAL MIGUEL ANTONIO GOMEZ
PADILLA, NATIONAL POLICE DIRECTOR, REPORTED TODAY THAT PABLO ESCOBAR
GAVIRIA, NUMBER ONE IN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, AND ONE OF THE OCHOA
BROTHERS, ALSO A KINGPIN IN THE GROUP, ARE APPARENTLEY SURROUNDED AND
SHOULD BE CAPTURED ANY TIME.

   GENERAL PADILLA TOLD REPORTERS AT 1500 GMT TODAY THAT THE SEARCH
FOR SOME OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL LEADERS HAD BEEN INTENSIFIED IN THE
PAST 2 DAYS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA IN COLOMBIA'S NORTHERN
CENTER. HE REFUSED TO IDENTIFY THE PLACE SO AS NOT TO HAMPER THE
OPERATIONS.

   HE ALSO SAID THAT THE SEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED BY THE POLICE'S
ELITE GROUP, SUPPORTED BY ARMY AND AIR FORCE TROOPS.

   GEN PADILLA SAID: "FOR THE PAST 2 DAYS, SPECIAL ELITE POLICE
MEMBERS, SUPPORTED BY THE AIR FORCE AND MILITARY UNITS, HAVE
CONFRONTED DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN THE SEARCH FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING CAPOS
WHO WILL BE CAPTURED LATER."

   "AT THIS TIME, WE ARE OPERATING IN A SPECIFIC AREA AGAINST THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL."  HE ALSO SAID THAT "PABLO ESCOBAR AND ONE OF THE
OCHOA BROTHERS" ARE POSSIBLY ENCIRCLED AND THAT THE CLASHES
"APPARENTLY HAVE RESULTED IN TWO MEN BEING KILLED AND NUMEROUS OTHERS
BEING DETAINED."

   THE HIGH-RANKING OFFICER ASKED NEWSMEN FOR TIME "TO COMPLETE THE
ACTION AND, POSSIBLY, TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED VICTORY."

   POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT THE OPERATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE
CONCORNA MUNICIPALITY AREA, IN ANTIOQUIA'S MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION,
BETWEEN MEDELLIN AND BOGOTA, SOME 180 KM NORTHWEST OF THE COLOMBIAN
CAPITAL, WHERE GUERRILLAS OF THE CAMILIST UNION - NATIONAL LIBERATION
ARMY (UC-ELN) ARE ALSO ACTIVE.

   THE MEDELLIN CARTEL IS REGARDED AS THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT DRUG
TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION AND, ACCORDING TO THE U.S. POLICE, IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE SMUGGLED INTO THE UNITED
STATES.

   PABLO ESCOBAR AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUEZ, THE CARTEL'S NUMBER ONE
AND NUMBER TWO MEN, RESPECTIVELY, ARE RANKED AMONG THE WORLD'S 20
RICHEST MEN BY SPECIALIZED U.S. MAGAZINES LIKE "FORBES" AND "FORTUNE,"

   JORGE LUIS OCHOA HAS TWO BROTHERS WHO ARE ALSO REGARDED AS
IMPORTANT DRUG KINGPINS.

   BOGOTA, 23 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, HEAD OF
THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, HAS ESCAPED FROM THE COLOMBIAN POLICE TRAP WHICH
WAS SET UP 2 DAYS AGO TO CAPTURE HIM, POLICE SOURCES SAID.

   ESCOBAR, REGARDED AS THE OPERATIONS CHIEF OF COLOMBIA'S LARGEST
COCAINE - EXPORTING GROUP, FLED "VIRTUALLY IN UNDERWEAR," ONE OF THE
OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATIONS SAID.

   CHIEF OF POLICE GENERAL MIGUEL PADILLA HAD EARLIER REPORTED THAT
THE DRUG TRAFFICKER HAD BEEN "SURROUNDED" AND THAT "HIS CAPTURE WAS
IMMINENT." PADILLA ALSO SAID HE WAS "ALMOST SURE" THAT THE OPERATION,
IN WHICH THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE ALSO PARTICIPATED, WOULD YIELD
"POSITIVE RESULTS."

   THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES SURROUNDED AND RAIDED FOUR ESTATES OWNED
BY ESCOBAR GAVIRIA IN THE MIDDLE REGION OF THE MAGDALENA RIVER, IN
COLOMBIA'S NORTHERN CENTER.

   ON THE ESTATES, CALLED "LAS PALMAS," "EL ORO," "LA PAZ," AND
"FLORENCIA," 50 BODYGUARDS AND 5 WOMEN WERE DETAINED.  TWO
UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE ENSUING CLASHES.

   THE POLICE SEIZED RIFLES, ISRAELI-MADE UZZI SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND
SEVERAL GRENADES.

   ACCORDING TO A POLICE SOURCE, THE POLICE ELITE TROOPS HAVE
CONTINUED TO COMB THE AREAS NEAR THE RAIDED ESTATES IN AN EFFORT TO
TRACK THE ESCAPEES, WHO COULD INCLUDE ONE OF THE THREE OCHOA BROTHERS,
WHO ARE THE CARTEL'S HEADS.

   THE OPERATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED IN THE COCORNA MUNICIPALITY, IN
THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA IN ANTIOQUIA, BETWEEN MEDELLIN AND BOGOTA, 180 KM
NORTHWEST FROM BOGOTA.

   THE MEDELLIN CARTEL IS CONSIDERED RESPONSIBLE FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE
COCAINE THAT ENTERS THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 23 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI REJECTED THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY THE REBELS ON 22
NOVEMBER FOR AN "IMMEDIATE" CEASE-FIRE WITH THE ARMY UNDER THE UNITED
NATIONS SUPERVISION THIS AFTERNOON.

   (THE REBEL PROPOSAL) "IS HARDLY SERIOUS.  WE DO NOT FEEL THIS
PROPOSAL HAS BEEN ADDRESSED TO THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS NOT SERIOUS.
AGAIN (THE GUERRILLAS) ASSERT THAT THERE ARE TWO ARMIES. THERE IS JUST
ONE ARMY IN EL SALVADOR," THE RIGHTIST PRESIDENT SAID.

   CRISTIANI'S STATMENTS WERE MOMENTARILY INTERRUPTED BY AN INTENSIVE
AIR RAID BY SIX SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES WHICH ARE BOMBING
GUERRILLA POSITIONS IN THE SLOPES OF THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO.

   COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES
GENERAL STAFF, WHO WAS ACCOMPANYING CRISTIANI, ASSERTED THAT THE ARMY
IS CHASING AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF "GUERRILLAS WHO ARE FLEEING IN
GREAT CONFUSION."

   CLANDESTINE, 23 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] JUST AS WE REPORTED
THIS AFTERNOON, FASCIST CRISTIANI AND PONCE, THE VISIBLE HEAD OF LA TANDONA
[REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY] HELD A PECULIAR NEWS CONFERENCE WHICH NOT EVEN THE
CUSCATLAN RADIO NETWORK EVEN DARED BROADCAST.

    THE NEWS CONFERENCE HAD JUST BEGUN THIS AFTERNOON WITH CRISTIANI
AND SOME REPORTERS.  PONCE WAS BESIDE HIM.  SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION
OCCURRED WHICH STARTLED BOTH CRISTIANI AND PONCE.  THE NERVOUSNESS OF
CRISTIANI AND PONCE DID NOT FADE AWAY.  THEY WERE SCARED.  THE
REPORTERS ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE EXPLOSION.  AFTER STAMMERING
FOR A WHILE, PONCE SAID IT WAS A BOMBING BY THE ARMY ON THE SLOPES OF
THE [SAN] SALVADOR VOLCANO.

   IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE, CRISTIANI REJECTED THE FMLN'S [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] POSITION, WHICH HE DESCRIBED
AS A PROPOSAL.  BUT THE FMLN HAS MADE NO PROPOSAL.  THE FMLN HAS BUT
ECHOED THE CLAMOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND VARIOUS
ORGANIZATIONS, ALL OF WHICH DEMAND A CEASE - FIRE IN THE COUNTRY.
CONSEQUENTLY, CRISTIANI HAS NOT REJECTED A CEASE - FIRE PROPOSAL, BUT
THE POSITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 23 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] HONDURAS TODAY
DEMANDED FROM NICARAGUA THE "IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL" OF SANDINIST TROOPS
CONCENTRATED ALONG COMMON BORDER AREAS AND WARNED OF ITS INTENTION TO
"REPEL ANY ACTION THAT VIOLATES HONDURAS' TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY AND
INTEGRITY."

   HONDURAS, IN A NOTE SENT BY FOREIGN MINISTER CARLOS LOPEZ CONTRERAS
TO HIS COLLEAGUE MIGUEL D'ESCOTO, STATED ITS "CONCERN DUE TO THE
ANNOUNCEMENTS NICARAGUAN SPOKESMEN ARE MAKING ON TAKING MILITARY
ACTION AGAINST THEIR ARMED OPPOSITION, WHEREVER THEY MAY BE."

   IN THE HONDURAN DEPARMENT OF EL PARAISO, ON THE NICARAGUAN BORDER,
THERE ARE SOME 12,000 ARMED ANTI-SANDINISTS, BASED THERE SINCE 1982,
WHO RESIST DEMOBILIZATION AND ARGUE THAT THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY IN
NICARAGUA.

   TO THIS EFFECT, LOPEZ CONTRERAS POINTED OUT THAT "THE BORDER AREA
THREATENED BY SANDINIST ARMY AND ARTILLERY, HOLDS SOME 15,000
HONDURANS, ALSO CAMPS OF UNARMED FORMER NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE
FIGHTERS, MANY WHOM ARE CRIPPLED, WITH THEIR FAMILIES."

   THE HONDURAN PROTEST NOTE SAYS THAT "TO INDISCRIMINATELY BOMB THE
HONDURAN CIVILIAN POPULATION WOULD BE A BARBARIC ACT, AND IF IT WERE
CARRIED OUT INVOKING A SO-CALLED RIGHT TO MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST
THEIR ARMED OPPOSITION, IT WOULD BE A CONSCIOUS MASSACRE."

   THE FOREIGN MINISTRY WARNED THAT "THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT
RESIGN ITS RIGHT TO REPEL ANY ACTION THAT VIOLATES OUR COUNTRY'S
SOVEREIGNTY AND NATIONAL INTEGRITY."

   NEVERTHELESS, THE OFFICER CLARIFIED THAT THE HONDURAN ARMY HAS NOT
MOVED ADDITIONAL TROOPS INTO THAT BORDER AREA.

   LOPEZ CONTRERAS INSISTED THAT THE "CONTRAS," WHO ARE AT CAMPS NEAR
NICARAGUA, ARE "MOSTLY CIVILIANS AND UNARMED FORMER FIGHTERS."

   THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER'S STATEMENT CONTRASTED WITH THE FACT
THAT THE "CONTRAS" THEMSELVES HAVE REITERATED THEIR REFUSAL TO TURN IN
THEIR WEAPONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF SUPPORT AND
VERIFICATION (CIAV).

   THE CIAV, MADE UP BY OAS AND UN DELEGATES, WAS CREATED IN SEPTEMBER
TO DIRECT THE "CONTRAS'" DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, OR RESETTLEMENT
PROCESS, AGREED IN AUGUST AT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

   THE PRESIDENTS SET THE DEMOBILIZATION DATE FOR 5 DECEMBER.

   THE TALKS ON THIS TOPIC, HELD IN WASHINGTON BETWEEN THE "CONTRAS"
AND THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT, SPONSORD BY THE CIAV, AND IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE HONDURAN DELEGATES, WERE SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY ON
WEDNESDAY.

   FORESEEING "POSSIBLE INCIDENTS," THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SAID
IT HAS INFORMED OF THE OAS AND UN SECRETARIES GENERAL.


DEV-MUC3-0859 (GTE)

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [REPORT] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] CRISTIANI
EMPHASIZED THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE CAPABLE OF COUNTERING ANY
AGGRESSION ON THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  HE ALSO TERMED AS A COMPLETE
FAILURE THE TERRORIST OFFENSIVE, WHICH WAS SPURNED BY THE CITIZENRY,
ADDING THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE
FMLN'S TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   [CRISTIANI] "LET US SAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT ARE PREPARED TO MILITARILY COUNTER THE AGGRESSION FOR AS
LONG AS THE FMLN WANTS TO.  THE FMLN DECIDED TO LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE
BECAUSE IT THOUGHT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SUPPORTED IT [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THE PEOPLE HAVE SPURNED IT ONCE AGAIN.  THE ONLY THING THE
FMLN HAS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE IS TO EARN THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S SCORN."

   "WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT A CEASE-FIRE AND NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE BUT
WE BELIEVE THAT THE ENDING OF HOSTILITIES SHOULD BE THE FIRST GESTURE
BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN TALK TO THE FMLN.  IF THIS DOES
NOT OCCUR, I DO NOT THINK THAT ONE SINGLE SALVADORAN WILL TRUST THE
FMLN IN THE LEAST [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE, MEANING THE ARMED FORCES
AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC, DO NOT WANT TO [WORDS
INDISTINCT]."

   THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE CURFEW WILL
BE MODIFIED, PARTICULARLY IN PLACES WHERE ORDER HAS BEEN COMPLETELY
RESTORED.  HE ALSO EXPLAINED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER SOUGHT A
MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT BECAUSE THAT IS CLARIFIED IN
THE CONSTITUTION.

    CRISTIANI "WE HAVE NEVER SOUGHT A MILITARY SOLUTION.  THE FMLN IS
THE ONE WHICH HAS OPTED FOR A MILITARY SOLUTION.  WE HAVE NOT [WORDS
INDISTINCT] GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WEAPONS AND WE HAVE NOT
SOUGHT THE ARMED FORCES TO DO IT.  THE FMLN IS THE ONLY ONE TRYING TO
SEIZE POWER WITH ITS WEAPONS.  THE ARMED FORCES HAS ONLY FULFILLED ITS
DUTY, WHICH IS TO COUNTER AN ARMED ACTION."

   "FURTHERMORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS AGGRESSION IS [WORDS INDISTINCT]
NICARAGUA AND CUBA, BECAUSE NICARAGUA AND CUBA [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE
FMLN WOULD HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF [WORDS INDISTINCT] PEACE IN EL
SALVADOR."

   THE PRESIDENT ASSERTED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE WITH THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS BUT IT MUST BE FULLY CONVINCED THAT THE REBEL GROUPS
ARE WILLING TO PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
IN A PEACEFUL AND VOLUNTARY WAY.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
ROLE IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, WAS LIMITED TO NOTIFYING HIS COUNTERPART,
CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ABOUT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION AND REASSERTING
THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION GIVEN THE FMLN DELEGATION'S ABSENCE -- WHICH
CONFIRMED THEIR LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  


DEV-MUC3-0860 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, 23 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
WHENEVER WE HAVE MADE ANY PEACE PROPOSAL, THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
ANSWERS BY SAYING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND THAT OUR
PROPOSALS ARE NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE WE MUST RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION.
THAT IS WHAT ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] ALWAYS SAYS.
WELL, WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK [U.S.  AMBASSADOR] WILLIAM WALKER -- WHO
HAS SAID IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] PEACE PROPOSALS ARE NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE THEY
VIOLATE THE SALVADORAN CONSTITUTION -- IF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT
PROHIBIT FOREIGN TROOPS FROM COMING TO OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT THE
GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL?  WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
AND THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WHY U.S. ARMY SPECIAL FORCES CAME TO EL
SALVADOR, AS PRESIDENT BUSH HIMSELF ANNOUNCED?  WE SAW THESE SPECIAL
FORCES IN THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR, VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION THAT
YOU PEOPLE CLAIM TO DEFEND.

   WE WANT TO ASK THE PATRIOTIC OFFICIALS: WHY ARE THERE THREE ARMIES
RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY?  THERE IS THE FMLN ARMY, THE LA TANDONA
[REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPT GEN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY] ARMY, AND PRESIDENT BUSH'S ARMY.  SO, WHAT
IS THE ANSWER?  WHENEVER WE PROPOSE A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE
CONFLICT, WE ARE TOLD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT VIOLATES THE
CONSTITUTION.  HOWEVER, PRESIDENT BUSH VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION THAT
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY CLAIM TO DEFEND WHEN HE
SENT A FOREIGN MILITARY FORCE TO THIS COUNTRY.  HE ALSO VIOLATED THE
SOVEREIGNTY OF THIS NATION.  THEREFORE, GENTLEMEN OF ARENA AND OF THE
HIGH COMMAND, THIS LOVE FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS THAT YOU
CLAIM TO HAVE IS FALSE.

   WE WANT TO ASK COLONEL PONCE: WHY IS THERE A FOREIGN MILITARY FORCE
IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW?  DOESN'T THE CONSTITUTION THAT YOUR ARMED
FORCES CLAIM TO RESPECT PROHIBIT IT?  IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN THE NATION
WANTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE, YOU PEOPLE SAY IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE WE MUST RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION.  HOWEVER, WHEN
PRESIDENT BUSH ARROGANTLY ANNOUNCES IN HIS PRESIDENTIAL PLANE THAT HIS
FORCES HAVE CARRIED OUT OPERATIONS IN A SAN SALVADOR HOTEL, THEN THE
CONSTITUTION IS WORTH NOTHING.

   WE WANT TO APPEAL TO THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS TO THINK ABOUT THIS
SITUATION.  THERE ARE OFFICERS BEING KILLED ON THE BATTLEFIELDS.  FOR
EXAMPLE, AN OFFICER FROM THE MORAZAN BATTALION DIED IN ALTOS DE LA
CUEVA IN SAN MIGUEL; LIEUTENANTS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN SAN SALVADOR
CITY; DOZENS OF LIEUTENANTS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED OR KILLED IN THE LAST 10
DAYS.  OFFICERS, YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS.  SO WE WANT TO CALL ON THE
LIEUTENANTS, THE CAPTAINS, THE PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, TO THINK ABOUT THIS
SITUATION.  YOU ARE BEING TOLD YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION.
WHAT CONSTITUTION?  AFTER ALL, A HERD OF GRINGO RAMBOS IS HERE; AND
WITH THEIR YANKEE BOOTS, THEY HAVE TRAMPLED ON THE CONSTITUTION.  SO
OFFICERS, WHAT ARE YOU DEFENDING?  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS?  THIS
SITUATION IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY SALVADORAN PATRIOT.  OFFICERS, WE
KNOW YOU ARE LISTENING TO US IN THE GARRISONS TO FIND OUT WHAT IS
HAPPENING, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT NETWORK IS HIDING THIS INFORMATION
FROM YOU.  YOU MUST THINK OVER THIS SITUATION, OFFICERS.  YOU ARE
SHEDDING BLOOD, LOSING ARMS AND LEGS IN THE BATTLEFIELDS, SACRIFICING
YOUR LIVES, SEEING HOW THE CAPITAL CITY IS BEING DESTROYED BY THE
BOMBINGS, AND YOU ARE TOLD THIS IS BEING DONE TO DEFEND THE
CONSTITUTION.  HOWEVER, MR BUSH DECIDED TO SEND A HERD OF RAMBOS WHO
ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING.  AFTER ALL, THEY DID NOTHING, EXCEPT COVER THEIR
FACES LIKE COMMON CRIMINALS.  SO, OFFICERS, WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR?
WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE?  IS IT COMMUNISM, OR THIS OR THAT?  IS IT
BECAUSE MSGR ROMERO WAS A COMMUNIST AND THEREFORE MURDERED?  WAS IT
BECAUSE THE JESUITS WERE COMMUNISTS AND THEREFORE MURDERED?  NOW IT IS
SAID THAT THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBERS ARE COMMUNISTS.
OTHERS SAY THAT THE JOURNALISTS, THE TEACHERS ARE COMMUNISTS; EVERYONE
IS A COMMUNIST.  IS THIS A NATION OF COMMUNISTS?  WHAT IS THIS?  WE
MUST START TO THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION AT THIS CRITICAL HOUR FOR THE
NATION.  [CONTINUED]

TEXT OF THE NOTE READS.

   NOTE NO. 122-DSM

   TEGUCIGALPA, 23 NOVEMBER 1989

   HIS EXCELLENCY

   MR MIGUEL D'ESCOTO BROCKMANN

   FOREIGN MINISTER

   MANAGUA, NICARAGUA

   MR MINISTER:

   MY GOVERNMENT HAS NOTED WITH GREAT CONCERN THE CONCENTRATION OF
NICARAGUAN TROOPS AT VARIOUS POINTS OF THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS, AS
WELL AS THE ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE BY NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN
ABOUT BEGINNING MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST THEIR ARMED OPPOSITION,
REGARDLESS OF LOCATION.

   TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE DANGER REPRESENTED BY THE
CONCENTRATION OF TROOPS AT THE BORDER, MY GOVERNMENT HEREBY WARNS THAT
IT IS A VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, PARTICULARLY TO INTER-AMERICAN
LAW, TO RESORT TO THREATS OR THE USE OF FORCE AND TO VIOLATE THE
SOVERIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF OTHER STATES.

   AS YOUR GOVERNMENT IS FULLY AWARE OF -- AND THIS HAS BEEN VERIFIED
BY ON-SITE INSPECTIONS BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF SUPPORT AND
VERIFICATION (CIAV) -- APPROXIMATELY 15,000 HONDURANS LIVE IN THE
BORDER SECTOR CURRENTLY THREATENED BY THE SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY AND
ARTILLERY.  THE SECURITY OF THOSE CITIZENS IS THE PRIMARY
RESPONSIBILITY OF MY GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, IN THAT SECTOR THERE ARE
CAMPS OF DISARMED FORMER COMBATANTS FROM THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE
[RN].  MANY OF THEM ARE WAR CRIPPLED AND THEIR RELATIVES, MOST OF WHOM
ARE CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND THE ELDERLY.

   TO CARRY OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AGAINST THE HONDURAN CIVILIAN
POPULATION AND TO VIOLATE THAT SECTOR OF HONDURAN TERRITORY WOULD BE A
BARBARIC ACTION AGAINST HUMANITY.  IF YOU ARE REFERRING TO AN ALLEGED
RIGHT TO CARY OUT MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST YOUR ARMED OPPOSITION "NO
MATTER WHERE THEY ARE," I REMIND YOU THAT THIS WOULD BE AN INTENTIONAL
MASSACRE, BECAUSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT AREA ARE CIVILIANS AND
THE REST ARE DISARMED FORMER COMBATANTS.  THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN
VERIFIED BY THE CIAV.

   THEREFORE, MY GOVERNMENT DEMANDS THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE
NICARAGUAN TROOPS CONCENTRATED IN THE BORDER AREAS WITH HONDURAS.  UP
UNTIL THIS TIME, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT INCREASED THE NUMBER
OF TROOPS WHO REGULARLY COMPOSE THE BORDER SECURITY FORCES.

   NEVERTHELESS, MY GOVERNMENT IS NOT GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO REPEL ANY
ACTION THAT VIOLATES HONDURAN SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY
AND TO CARRY OUT THE CONSULTATIONS IT DEEMS NECESSARY, TO ADOPT THE
INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE DEFENSE MEASURES THE SITUATION REQUIRES.

   MY GOVERNMENT ALSO WANTS TO STATE THAT IT VIEWS WITH ASTONISHMENT
THE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT TO THE
COUNTERREVOLUTION -- DURING THE TALKS PROMOTED BY THE CIAV IN THE
UNITED STATES -- IN THE SENSE THAT THE NICARAGUAN INTERNAL ARMED
CONFLICT BE SOLVED BY WITHDRAWING THE ARMED OPPOSITION TO HONDURAS.
THIS PROPOSAL CLEARLY VIOLATES THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENT AND THE
AGREEMENTS SIGNED AT THE TELA SUMMIT, WHICH CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR
DEMOCRATIZATION, NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, DEMOBILIZATION, AND
REPATRIATION.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 24 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] ATTORNEY GENERAL
MAURICIO COLORADO, INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS IN EL
SALVADOR, SAID TODAY THAT THE DECLARATIONS MADE SO FAR, AMONG THEM
THOSE MADE BY LUCIA BARRERA CERNA, ONE OF THE MAIN WITNESSES, "ARE NOT
CONCLUSIVE, NOR HAVE THEY SHED ANY LIGHT" ON THE IDENTITY OF THE
KILLERS."

   THE JESUITS, FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN, WERE MURDERED 9
DAYS AGO BY A GROUP OF MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS DURING A "CURFEW"
DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE THAT
BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   LUCIA BARRERA, WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE COLORADO, A GOVERNMENT
COMMISSION INVESTIGATING THE MURDERS, AND SEVERAL DIPLOMATS, AMONG
THEM SPANISH AMBASSADOR FRANCISCO CADIZ, SAID THAT THE MURDERERS
NUMBERED BETWEEN 30 AND 40 UNIDENTIFIED MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.
COLORADO SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT "THERE ARE SEVERAL WITNESSES,
NONE OF WHICH HAS SHED MUCH LIGHT ON THE CASE.  THEIR DECLARATIONS ARE
NOT CONCLUSIVE REGARDING THIS SAD AND REGRETTABLE EVENT."  HE STRESSED
"THAT IT WOULD BE RASH TO SAY THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY DID IT."

   ACCORDING TO COLORADO, NEITHER FBI AGENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES,
NOR SCOTLAND YARD AGENTS FROM GREAT BRITAIN, NOR THE SPANISH
GOVERNMENT'S DELEGATES -- AS REQUESTED BY SALVDORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI WHEN HE PROMISED TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE EXHAUSTIVELY --
HAVE ARRIVED IN EL SALVADOR.

   HE SAID THAT THE COURT WILL SUBPOENA MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ,
DIRECTOR OF THE SAN SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL AID OFFICE, "TO
DECLARE WHAT SHE KNOWS, WHO TOLD HER WHAT, AND TO SAY IF SHE WAS AT
THE SCENE."

   THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL AID OFFICE, A HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION,
HAS PROMISED TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION JOINTLY WITH THE JESUITS.

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT "WE ARE INVESTIGATING ALL CLUES,"
WHEN ASKED BY REPORTERS IF HE WOULD INTERROGATE THE SOLDIERS WHO WERE
PATROLLING THE UNIVERSITY AREA WHERE THE MURDERS TOOK PLACE ON 16
NOVEMBER.

   MEANWHILE, JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA, JESUIT SUPERIOR IN CENTRAL AMERICA,
SAID THAT THE MAIN WITNESS TO THE MURDERS IS "SAFE AND SOUND" ABROAD,
POSSIBLY IN THE UNITED STATES.

   ACCORDING TO TOJEIRA, THE WITNESS, WHO WAS INTERROGATED REPEATEDLY,
WAS KEPT UNDER STRICT SECURITY. HE STRESSED THAT SHE LEFT FOR AN
UNKNOWN DESTINATION AND THAT SHE "IS AT EASE BECAUSE SHE HAS TOLD THE
TRUTH."

   JESUIT SUPERIOR TOJEIRA AND ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, ARCHBISHOP OF
SAN SALVADOR, HAVE ASSERTED THAT THERE IS A STRONG BELIEF THAT THE
MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS WERE EITHER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES OR
PERSONS CLOSELY LINKED TO THEM.

   WHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS BELIEF, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REPLIED, "I DO
NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION. HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE RASH TO SAY THAT THE
ARMY DID IT."

TIME WHEN THE WORLD'S ATTENTION IS RIVETED ON THE DEMOCRATIZATION
MOVEMENT IN EASTERN EUROPE, WE HEAR A GLOOMY NEWS REPORT THAT THE
PROTRACTED CIVIL WAR BETWEEN EL SALVADOR'S GOVERNMENTAL TROOPS
RECEIVING U.S. ASSISTANCE AND LEFTIST GUERRILLAS HAS RECENTLY ONCE
AGAIN INTENSIFIED, AND HAS TAKEN MANY LIVES.

   THE SOVIET UNION IS NOW PRODDING THE COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE,
WHICH WERE ONCE KNOWN AS SOVIET SATELLITES, TO DEMOCRATIZE AND TO
REFORM THEIR STATE SYSTEMS; WHY DOES THE UNITED STATES INCREASE ITS
MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR AND CAUSE THE CIVIL WAR TO INTENSIFY?

   LIKE MANY CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES BEFORE THEY BECAME
DEMOCRATIZED, THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS
SUCH THAT IT IS PLAGUED BY AN EXTREME FORM OF THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND
POOR, BY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, BY RIGHT-WING TERRORISM, AND BY ABUSE
OF HUMAN RIGHTS TO THE POINT WHERE IT COULD BE ENGULFED BY REVOLUTION
AT ANY TIME.  HOW CAN A COUNTRY WHERE MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION OUT OF A
POPULATION OF 5.4 MILLION ARE ON THE BORDER OF STARVATION, AND WHERE
ROUGHLY 20 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION ENJOYS 66 PERCENT OF THE
COUNTRY'S GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, BE IN PEACE?

   AFTER A LARGE-SCALE PEASANT UPRISING IN 1930, THE LEFTIST FORCES IN
THIS COUNTRY FORMED A UNIFIED GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION IN 1980 AND BEGAN
THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN EARNEST.

   THE OLIGARCHIC RULING CLASS, WHICH IS SAID TO CONSIST OF 15 TO 240
FAMILIES WITH HIGH INCOME, LAUNCHED A "CLEAN-UP OPERATION" AGAINST
GUERRILLAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE MILITARY, AND OPENLY MASSACRED THE
LEADERS OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS BY ORGANIZING AN EXTREME RIGHT-WING
ASSASSINATION GROUP CALLED THE "DEATH SQUAD."  THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR
AS TO ASSASSINATE INTELLECTUALS AND CLERGYMEN WHO CHAMPIONED SOCIAL
REFORM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.

   FILMS SUCH AS "ROMERO" AND "SALVADOR" THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN OUR
COUNTRY IN RECENT MONTHS ARE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE BRUTALITY COMMITTED
BY SUCH AN ASSASSINATION GROUP.  THIS GROUP WAS UNQUESTIONABLY BEHIND
THE RECENT ASSASSINATIONS IN WHICH 10 LABOR UNION LEADERS WERE
MERCILESSLY MASSACRED AND ANOTHER 8, INCLUDING A JESUIT PRIEST, WERE
BRUTALLY KILLED.

   THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE UNITED STATES LURKS BEHIND THE MILITARY AND
RIGHT-WING FORCES THAT ARE BENT ON SUPPRESSING THOSE WHO CALL FOR
SOCIAL REFORM AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, NOT STOPPING AT A "CLEANING
UP" OF THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS.  WHILE SENDING A GROUP OF MILITARY
ADVISERS TO EL SALVADOR TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS MOP UP THE
GUERRILLAS, THE UNITED STATES IS NOW ALSO SUPPLYING THE COUNTRY WITH
WEAPONS, INCLUDING ASSAULT HELICOPTERS, WORTH U.S. $103 MILLION.

   HOW LONG WILL THE UNITED STATES RETAIN ITS OLD POLICY OF IGNORING
SOCIAL REFORM AND DEMOCRATIZATION IN A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY AND OF
GIVING MILITARY AID TO ITS INCOMPETENT GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO DEFEND
ITS OWN INTERESTS?  WITH OUR EYES ON THE DEMOCRATIZATION MOVEMENT IN
EAST EUROPE, WE ARE COMPELLED TO THINK ONCE AGAIN OF THE
DEMOCRATIZATION IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND OF THE OUTSIDE
INTERVENTION THERE BLOCKING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   DRAWING A LESSON FROM THE DEFEAT IT SUFFERED IN VIETNAM AND IN
IRAN, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CEASE INTERFERING IN THE INTERNAL
AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] FOREIGNERS LINKED TO
TERRORISTS WILL BE DEPORTED.  IMMIGRATION GENERAL DIRECTOR COLONEL
MAXIMILIANO LEIVA HAS SAID THAT FOREIGNERS ARRESTED FOR THEIR TIES TO FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN
TURNED OVER TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CONSULAR REPRESENTATIVES.  HE REPORTED THE
ARRESTS WERE MADE BY THE TREASURY POLICE AND OTHER SECURITY ELEMENTS WHO ARE
COURAGEOUSLY FIGHTING THE FMLN MURDEROUS COMMUNISTS, WHO WANT TO INSTALL A
MARXIST - LENINIST GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THESE REBELS WILL NOT HAVE THEIR
WAY.  THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE DEPORTED TO THEIR PLACES OF ORIGIN.

   COL LEIVA ALSO NOTED THAT 1,100 SALVADORAN REFUGEES RETURNED
RECENTLY FROM COLOMONCAGUA, HONDURAS, WITHOUT GOING THROUGH LEGAL
IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES.  ARRIVING WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WERE CHILDREN
-- RAGING IN AGE FROM 12 TO 13, SOME LESS THAN 7.  COL LEIVA STATED
THE REFUGEES BROUGHT IN MEDICAL SUPPLIES, AND THEIR PLAN IS TO HELP
THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS IN THEIR AGGRESSION AGAINST THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 24 NOV 89 (DIARIO LATINO) -- [TEXT] "THE FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] USED TUPAC AMARU, VIETNAMESE, SANDINIST,
AND OTHER GUERRILLA WARFARE OFFENSIVE TACTICS IN ITS OFFENSIVE," [COLONEL
RENE EMILIO] PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES, STATED 23 NOVEMBER. HE REPORTED THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE
RESULTED IN 1,484 GUERRILLAS AND 284 SOLDIERS KILLED.  THE OFFICER SAID THAT
GUERRILLAS WERE ENGAGED IN A TACTICAL-TYPE DIALOGUE BY ATTENDING THE
MEETINGS WITH THE GOVERNMENT WHILE PREPARING FOR THE OFFENSIVE.  AMONG THE
WEAPONS SEIZED, WE FOUND RUSTED WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION, INDICATING THEY HAD
BEEN BURIED FOR A LONG TIME.  WE ALSO FOUND DOCUMENTS AND MEDICINES WITH
OLDT EXPIRATION DATES."

   HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES LEARNED ON 9 NOVEMBER ABOUT THE
OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN ON 11 NOVEMBER, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO
ACT. THAT IS WHY THE ARMED FORCES ACTED WITH CAUTION WHEN IT BEGAN,
BECAUSE THE FMLN WANTED A FAR-REACHING REACTION, SOMETHING WHICH WOULD
HAVE ENTAILED HUGE DAMAGE TO CIVILIANS, AND SO THE GUERRILLAS'
INTENTIONS FAILED.

   THE TUPAC AMARU TACTIC EMPLOYED CONSISTED IN DIGGING LARGE DITCHES,
AND SO THE GUERRILLAS FORCED THE PEOPLE TO DIG THEM, COL PONCE SAID.

   REGARDING THE BOMBINGS HEARD EAST OF THE CAPITAL DURING THE NEWS
CONFERENCE, COL PONCE SAID IT WAS A OPERATION TO PURSUE "A GROUP OF
TERRORISTS WHO HAD BEEN LOCATED IN THE LOS CASTILLOS, SAN FRANCISCO,
AND EL PROGRESO CANTONS.  HOWEVER, ONLY THE FIRST CANTON WAS SHELLED
BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN EVACUATED, WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE IN THE OTHER TWO
CANTONS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES TODAY REPORTED THAT A PLANE LOADED WITH WEAPONS FOR GUERRILLAS
COMING FROM NICARAGUA CRASHED AT DAWN TODAY IN A TOWN OF USULUTAN
DEPARMENT, KILLING THREE CREWMEN WHILE A FOURTH COMMITTED "SUICIDE."

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) POINTED OUT THAT THE
PLANE CRASHED AT 0025 LOCAL TIME (0625 GMT) IN A TOWN IN EL TRANSITO,
EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT. ACCORDING TO COPREFA, THREE CREWMEN DIED
DURING THE ACCIDENT AND A FOURTH SURVIVED, BUT COMMITTED SUICIDE
AFTERWARD.  THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT IDENTIFY THE CREWMEN, STATING
ONLY THAT THEY WERE WEARING CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS.

   THE MILITARY SOURCE REPORTED THAT THE PLANE, A WHITE AND BLUE,
RED-STRIPED TWO-MOTOR "CESSNA" BELONGS TO A COMPANY CALLED "SETA"
HEADQUARTERED IN NICARAGUA.

   THE COPREFA REPORT, WHICH IS BASED ON THE FLIGHT SCHEDULE, STATES
THAT THE PLANE LEFT MANAGUA (NICARAGUA) AND WAS TO HAVE LANDED IN
AMATECAMPO, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT, BUT SUFFERED AN ACCIDENT IN "PIEDRA
PACHA" NEAR EL TRANSITO.

   COPREFA REPORTS THAT THE PLANE WAS CARRYING 24 "SAM-7"
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, A "REDEYE" MISSILE, A 75- MM ANTITANK GUN,
AND 21 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION FOR NONRECOILLESS 75- MM CANNON.

   SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS SURROUNDED THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT AND
SEIZED THE WEAPONS, THE SOURCE REPORTED.

   ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES
HAVE ACCUSED THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT OF HELPING THE FARABUNNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) LOGISTICALLY AND WITH WEAPONS.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, THE OFFENSIVE THAT THE FMLN BEGAN ON
11 NOVEMBER, WHICH HAS YIELDED 2,000 DEAD AND THOUSANDS OF WOUNDED,
WAS SUPPORTED BY NICARAGUA AND CUBA, WHICH SUPPLIED MOST OF THE
WEAPONS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [BULLETIN]
[ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE] [TEXT] A CESSNA PLANE TRANSPORTING
WEAPONS FROM MANAGUA CRASHED TODAY AT 0525 ON A SMALL LANDING STRIP IN
PIEDRA PACHA CANTON, EL TRANSITO, 6 KM EAST OF USULUTAN.  THE PLANE
WAS CARRYING THE FOLLOWING WEAPONS FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT TERRORISTS: 24 SAM-7, SOVIET-MADE SURFACE-TO-AIR
MISSILES; 21 GRENADES FOR 75-MM CANNONS; A 75-MM ANTI-TANK CANNON; A
U.S.-MADE SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE KNOWN AS THE RED-EYE; AND OTHER
EQUIPMENT.

   THE PLANE, A WHITE AND BLUE TWIN-ENGINE CRAFT WITH RED STRIPES, WAS
BEING FLOWN BY SANDINISTS.  FOUR PERSONS, DRESSED IN CAMOUFLAGE WEAR,
WERE KILLED AT THE SITE OF THE ACCIDENT.  SOME DOCUMENTS THAT ARE
BEING ANALYZED BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE WERE ALSO FOUND AT THE SCENE.
AMONG THE DOCUMENTS IS THE FLIGHT PLAN THAT SHOWS THAT THE PLANE
DEPARTED FROM MANAGUA, NICARAGUA, AND ITS DESTINATION WAS EL SALVADOR.
THIS PLANE WAS TO HAVE LANDED AT THE AMATICAMPO LANDING STRIP, ALONG
THE LA PAZ DEPARTMENT COASTLINE.

   THE INFORMATION ADDS THAT THE PLANE BELONGED TO ZETA COMPANY --
OFFICES LOCATED ACROSS FROM THE CESAR AUGUSTO SANDINO AIRPORT IN
MANAGUA -- AND THAT IT DEPARTED EARLY THIS MORNING FROM MANAGUA.  THE
AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING MORE DETAILS REGARDING THIS INCIDENT,
WHICH PROVES NICARAGUA'S INTERFERENCE IN EL SALVADOR'S DOMESTIC
AFFAIRS.

   CLANDESTINE, 26 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] IN VIEW OF
THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY'S ARMED CONFLICT AND THE ARMED
FORCES' ATTITUDE, THE FMLN REPORTS THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THAT THE GOVERNMENT, FAR FROM SUSPENDING, HAS INTENSIFIED
BOMBINGS AND ARTILLERY ATTACKS.  IT IS NOW EVEN USING 105-MM OBUS
HOWITZERS IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS.  WE ARE INFORMING THE NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT SUCH BOMBINGS HAVE YIELDED THOUSANDS
OF REFUGEES AND DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES BELONGING TO HUMBLE
FAMILIES IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, USULUTAN, AND ZACATECOLUCA.  IN
REJECTING A CEASE-FIRE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TURNED ITS BACK ON THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

   2.  THAT IN VIEW OF THE RUMORS THAT THE FMLN IS PLANNING TO ATTACK
U.S. CITIZENS [7-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] TO NOT ATTACK U.S.
PERSONNEL AND INSTALLATIONS.  THAT POLICY WAS EVIDENT DURING THE
SHERATON HOTEL INCIDENT IN WHICH, ALTHOUGH OUR FORCES ENJOYED AN
ADVANTAGE OVER THE GREEN BERETS TRAPPED IN THAT HOTEL, AND DESPITE THE
PREVAILING TENSION, THEY RIGOROUSLY ADHERED TO THAT POLICY WITH
DISCIPLINE.

   3.  THE FMLN DOES NOT ADVOCATE CAPTURING PRISONERS OR CARRYING OUT
INDISCRIMINATE ARMED ACTIONS.

   4.  WE ALSO ALERT THE ENTIRE NATION AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
ABOUT THE GENERALIZED REPRESSION BEING UNLEASHED BY THE ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT.  THAT PARTY, BY TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THE STATE OF SIEGE AND THE MARTIAL LAW, HAS HASTILY
APPROVED THE ANTITERRORIST LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT TO INSTITUTIONALIZE
TERROR.  THIS LAW SEEKS TO ELIMINATE THE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT
OUR PEOPLE HAVE ACHIEVED, ALL FORMS OF OPPOSITION, AND TO CONSOLIDATE
A FASCIST REGIME.  THIS HAS BEEN THE HISTORIC PROJECT OF ROBERTO
D'AUBUISSON AND LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF
THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] WHO NOW CONTROLS THE
ENTIRE MILITARY LEADERSHIP.

DEV-MUC3-0872 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THIS AIRCRAFT, I REPEAT, WAS
CARRYING VERY SOPHISTICATED ARMAMENTS.  IT CARRIED 24 SOVIET-MADE
SURFACE-TO-AIR-MISSILES, ONE 75-MM RECOILLESS CANNON, GRENADES FOR
THAT CANNON, AND IT ALSO HAD DOCUMENTS AND MANUALS EXPLAINING ITS
USAGE.

   WE CAN NO LONGER CONTINUE DOING NOTHING IN VIEW OF THIS GENOCIDAL,
INTERVENTIONIST ACTION, AND MORE THAN ANYTHING, A TRAITOROUS ACTION BY
DANIEL ORTEGA.  THAT IS WHY WE RESOLVED ON 25 NOVEMBER, SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, TO MAKE THE PROPER CHARGES AGAINST ORTEGA AND HIS GOVERNMENT
BEFORE THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE OAS SECURITY COUNCIL.

   SECOND, WE WILL SUSPEND RELATIONS, BE THEY DIPLOMATIC, COMMERCIAL,
OR OF ANY SORT WITH NICARAGUA.  WE WILL WITHDRAW OUR MISSION FROM
NICARAGUA.

   THIRD, AT THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT, EL SALVADOR WILL NOT GO TO
NICARAGUA.  RIGHT NOW, IT WILL ASK THE OTHER THREE DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENTS OF THE AREA TO TRANSFER THE SITE OF THAT MEETING TO ANOTHER
FRATERNAL CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.  WE WILL DEMAND THERE, BEFORE THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES THAT THEY TRULY HONOR THE ESQUIPULAS PACT
AND CONDEMN DANIEL ORTEGA FOR SUPPORTING THE FMLN

   WE CAN APPRECIATE, VERY FRANKLY, WHAT THE FMLN IS.  THEY ARE
NOTHING MORE THAN THE PUPPETS OF THE COMMUNIST AGGRESSION.  MR CASTRO
AND MR ORTEGA ARE RESISTING ALL OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE
IN THE SOVIET UNION AND IN ALL OF THE COUNTRIES BEHIND THE IRON
CURTAIN WHICH ARE ATTEMPTING TO DEMOCRATIZE THEMSELVES AND GIVE THEIR
PEOPLE LIBERTY.  THEY ARE THE ONLY TWO WHO SEEK TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN
IN POWER THROUGH THE RIFLE AND BY WAR.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE CANNOT PERMIT OUR COUNTRY, OUR SMALL EL
SALVADOR, OR OUR NOBLE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO BE THE VICTIMS OF THAT
COMMUNIST AGGRESSION WHICH DANIEL ORTEGA AND FIDEL CASTRO SEEK TO
LAUNCH.

   IN THAT SENSE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN VIEW OF THIS NEW SITUATION, WE
WANT YOU TO REFLECT ON THAT ARTIFICIAL CEASE-FIRE WHICH THE FMLN
LAUNCHED A FEW DAYS AGO.  WHAT IS THE FMLN UP TO WITH THAT CEASE-FIRE?
IT MADE THAT PROPOSAL AFTER IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE CITY THAT IT HAD
ATTACKED.  THE PEOPLE WERE RESUMING THEIR NORMAL ACTIVITIES AND
EVERYTHING WAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ARMED FORCES IN THOSE AREAS.
WHY DID THEY CALL FOR A CEASE-FIRE WHEN THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DEFEATED
IN THE OFFENSIVE BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO HAD REPUDIATED THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS?  THEY HAD NO REAL OBJECTIVE AHEAD, OTHER THAN TO
CONTINUE TO DESTROY, TO ASSASSINATE, AND TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE
TERRORIST ACTIONS HERE IN OUR COUNTRY.

   THEREFORE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT PERMIT ITSELF TO FALL
INTO ANOTHER TRAP OF THE FMLN.  IF THEY WENT TO MEXICO AND COSTA RICA
WITH A SINCERE DESIRE FOR PEACE, AS THEY TRIED TO MAKE US BELIEVE, WE
REALIZE TODAY THAT THOSE ACTIONS WERE JUST ANOTHER FARCE.  THIS
AGGRESSION WAS NOT PLANNED IN 2 OR 3 DAYS.  THIS AGGRESSION HAD BEEN
PLANNED SEVERAL MONTHS BACK.  KNOWING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THEY HAD THE GALL TO
 ATTEND AND MAKE THE ENTIRE WORLD BELIEVE THAT THEY REALLY WANTED
PEACE.  THEREFORE, WE CANNOT, I REPEAT SALVADORAN PEOPLE, FALL INTO      
ANOTHER TRAP OF THE FMLN.  THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DEMAND TERRITORIAL
RIGHTS IN OUR COUNTRY WHEN THEY ARE A BAND OF TERRORISTS AND ARE         
PUPPETS OF ORTEGA AND CASTRO.  LET US SEE IF THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE
SUPPORT, AS THEY ARE, WILL OWE ORTEGA AND CASTRO FAVORS.  IF THEY
SUCCEED, THEY WILL OWE LOYALTY NOT TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BUT TO      
COMMUNIST DICTATORS SUCH AS DANIEL ORTEGA AND FIDEL CASTRO.  THAT IS
WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLSIHED A CLEAR POSITION.

NOT OCCURRED IN OUR COUNTRY DURING A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN WHICH ALL

   WE REPORT THAT CITIZEN JUSTINIANO SAGASTUME RODRIGUEZ, 42, WAS

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] WE WANT PEACE BADLY AND ARE
CONVINCED THAT YOU SALVADORANS ALSO WANT PEACE AND VIEW IT AS A MAJOR
GOAL TO BE ACHIEVED.  WE ALSO MUST BE COURAGEOUS AND ENDURE THE FMLN
AGGRESSION AS WE, PARTICULARLY, YOU HAVE IN THE PAST DAYS.

   WE ARE WILLING TO SOLVE THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT THROUGH A DIALOGUE
PROCESS.  HOWEVER, WE CAN NO LONGER TRUST LIARS AND CYNICS WHO HAVE
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE PEOPLE'S DESIRE FOR PEACE AND OPPORTUNITIES
GIVEN TO THEM IN AN ATTEMPT TO SIMPLY GAIN GROUND AND TIME TO REARM
THEMSELVES TO ATTACK, KILL, AND DESTROY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THIS IS WHY TODAY WE DEMAND THAT THE FMLN END ALL THEIR
HOSTILITIES.  THE VERIFICATION TEAM ONUCA [UNITED NATIONS OBSERVER
GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA] MAY COME HERE IF THEY WANT TO, TO
ENSURE THAT THE FMLN ENDS THEIR HOSTILITES AND FINDS A WAY TO
INCORPORATE ITSELF TO THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS.  HOWEVER, WE
WILL NEVER AGAIN ALLOW OURSELVES TO FALL INTO THE TRAP SET UP BY FMLN
CYNICS WHO HAVE DECEIVED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT
LOOKING AFTER YOUR INTERESTS, BUT THOSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM
THAT ORTEGA AND FIDEL CASTRO ARE SENDING OUR WAY.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE MUST ASK YOU TO TRUST YOUR GOVERNMENT AND
ARMED FORCES.  IT MATTERS NOT WHAT DANIEL ORTEGA PLANS TO DO OR WHAT
WEAPONS HE SENDS THEM BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES WILL BE READY TO REPEL
ANY ATTACK OR ANY IRRATIONAL ACTION THAT THE FMLN MIGHT LAUNCH.

   YOU MUST REST ASSURED AND REALIZE THAT WE ARE WAGING A STRUGGLE FOR
THE SAKE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE; TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY FROM
AGGRESSIONS, WHICH REGARDLESS OF THEIR ORIGIN, SHOULD NOT HINDER THE
FREEDOM OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE MUST BE CONFIDENT THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE A
PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED, REPELLED,
AND REMOVED THIS AGGRESSION THROUGH A PROFESSIONALISM THAT MUST STAND
AS AN EXAMPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD TODAY.

   ALTHOUGH THE FMLN HAS HIDDEN BEHIND YOU, AS COWARDS DO, THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE GRADUALLY AND CAREFULLY DEALT A BLOW TO THEM WHILE
SAFEGUARDING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S INTERESTS.  THE ONLY DESTRUCTORS
HERE ARE THE FMLN FOLLOWERS; THE ONLY TERRORISTS HERE ARE FMLN
FOLLOWERS.  WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE IN OUR COUNTRY.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: I DO NOT WANT TO ALARM YOU.  I WANT US TO
GRADUALLY UNDERSTAND, AS EACH PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE FALLS INTO ITS
PLACE, WHAT THE FMLN REALLY IS: A PUPPET OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM
THAT IS ONLY SEEKING TO SUBJUGATE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, TAKE AWAY
THEIR FREEDOMS, AND SINK THEM INTO DESTITUTION, AS ORTEGA HAS DONE TO
THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.

   OUR NICARAGUAN POLICY HAS AT NO TIME BEEN AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN
PEOPLE; OUR POLICY IS ONLY AGAINST THAT ANTIDEMOCRATIC DICTATOR CALLED
ORTEGA WHO WANTS TO SPREAD DESTRUCTION AND DEATH TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO
SATISFY HIS OWN GOALS OF CONSOLIDATING A TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENT IN
NICARAGUA.

   WE MUST BE ALERT TO ALL THE UPCOMING INFORMATION REGARDING THE
NORMALIZATION OF THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY AND REST ASSURED THAT
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO HELP THE PEOPLE, WHO HAVE IN ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER SUFFERED FROM THE FMLN AGGRESSION, WITH MEDICINE, FOOD,
AND ESPECIALLY, THIS IS NEARLY FINALIZED, AID TO RECONSTRUCT THOSE
HOMES THAT WERE DAMAGED BY THIS SAVAGE AND IRRATIONAL FMLN ACTION.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH; GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS STATED THAT HE IS "PROUD AND HONORED" OVER
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S DECISION TO SEVER RELATIONS
WITH HIS GOVERNMENT, AND DESCRIBED THE SALVADORAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE AS A
"MURDERER."

   IN A SPEECH IN THE TOWN OF SOMOTILLO, ON THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS,
ORTEGA SAID THAT THE NEWS OF HIS SALVADORAN COLLEAGUE'S ANNOUNCEMENT
"FILLED ME WITH JOY BECAUSE WE WILL THUS AVOID RECEIVING THE PRESIDENT
OF A GOVERNMENT THAT MURDERS PRIESTS, NUNS, AND POLITICAL LEADERS."

   THE NICARAGUAN CAPITAL HAS BEEN SET AS THE SITE FOR THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR 8-9 DECEMBER.

   THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE WILL ASK THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH EL SALVADOR "UNTIL THE SLAYERS OF
THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS MURDERED IN EL SALVADOR ARE PUNISHED."  THE
PRIESTS WERE MURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   LIMA, 24 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] A 2-MONTH-OLD LABOR CONFLICT
INVOLVING [WORDS INDISTINCT] WORKERS, WHICH IN THE PAST FEW DAYS HAS
CAUSED STREET VIOLENCE IN LIMA, HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF
CONCERN FOR THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.

   THE STRIKE, WHICH WAS DECREED BY THE INTERSECTORIAL CONFEDERATION
OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES (CITE), IS BEING OBSERVED BY 300,000 PUBLIC
SERVANTS, WHO MAKE UP 50 PERCENT OF CITE MEMBERS. THE STRIKERS DEMAND
SALARY IMPROVEMENTS, THE REINSTATEMENT OF 250 DISMISSED WORKERS, AND
THE OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF THE CITE.

   RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA) SECRETARY
GENERAL LUIZ ALVA CASTRO, WHO IS ALSO THE APRA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,
REPORTED THAT TODAY HE MET WITH PRIME MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX IN
SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.

   ALVA SAID THAT "THERE IS GOOD WILL" TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE
CONFLICT, WHICH HAS AFFECTED LARGE SECTORS OF THE POPULATION, WHO MAKE
USE OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, JUSTICE, TRANSPORTATION, AND COMMUNICATION
SERVICES. THE STRIKE HAS ALSO AFFECTED THE STATE, WHICH HAS FAILED TO
COLLECT 70 PERCENT OF TAXES BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE BY THE TAX
COLLECTORS.

   ALVA CASTRO SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD HIM THAT THERE WILL
BE NO PROBLEM IN RECOGNIZING THE CITE, PROVIDED THAT THIS ORGANIZATION
MEETS THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

   THERE WERE INCIDENTS IN LIMA ON 23 NOVEMBER, WHEN GROUPS OF CITE
MEMBERS DEMONSTRATED IN DOWNTOWN LIMA AND WERE REPRESSED BY THE
POLICE. DURING THE INCIDENTS, BOMBS WERE DETONATED, TIRES WERE BURNED,
AND THE POLICE SHOT IN THE AIR. AT LEAST [9] PERSONS DIED DURING THE
INCIDENTS LAST WEEK.

   A UNION SOURCE TODAY SAID THAT A 15-DAY STRIKE BY 3,500 WORKERS OF
THE STATE-RUN MINERO PERU COMPANY HAS CAUSED DAILY LOSSES OF $800,000.

   ACCORDING TO THE LABOR MINISTRY, THE STRIKES HAVE COST THE PRIVATE
SECTOR 13 MILLION HOURS OF LABOR,

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE MINING SECTOR LOST $80 MILLION DURING
18 DAYS OF STRIKE IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, WHILE THE FISHING SECTOR
HAS LOST $150 MILLION BECAUSE OF A STRIKE THAT THE WORKERS OF THE
SECTOR BEGAN 55 DAYS AGO.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] I AM GOING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING, AND I AM GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU FROM THE HEART.  ABOUT 15
DAYS AGO, I HEARD THE NEWS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, THE
SALVADORAN ARMY, WAS BOMBING NEIGHBORHOODS AND CITIES IN EL SALVADOR,
THAT IT WAS MURDERING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  I LATER HEARD THAT THE
SALVADORAN ARMY HAD MURDERED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, AMONG THEM A PRIEST
WHO HAD BEEN DEAN OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY HERE IN NICARAGUA.  IT
WAS THEN THAT I BEGAN TO THINK AND ASKED MYSELF: HOW CAN I WELCOME THE
PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR HERE IN NICARAGUA WHEN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
SUMMIT IS HELD?  WHAT A PROBLEM.  A REAL PROBLEM.  HOW COULD I WELCOME
IN NICARAGUA THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS PRIESTS AND
BISHOPS, THAT KILLED MONSIGNOR ROMERO; A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS
CLERGYMEN, THAT HAS KILLED NUNS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER CHURCHES,
CATHOLICS AND EVANGELISTS; A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS WORKERS, PEASANTS,
LABORERS, AND LEADERS OF POLITICAL PARTIES, THAT HAS KILLED MORE THAN
600 CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS.  THEY WERE KILLED BY ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLIC ALLIANCE], THE RULING PARTY IN EL SALVADOR, AND
THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH IS THE SAME THING.  I KEPT ASKING MYSELF:
HOW CAN I WELCOME THEM IN NICARAGUA?  IT WOULD BE LIKE WELCOMING
SOMOZA.  ALL I COULD COME UP WITH WAS TO FIND AN EXCUSE NOT TO HOLD
THE MEETING.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE FOR THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE TO
HAVE TO WELCOME AND HAVE AS A GUEST THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT
THAT KILLS PRIESTS, NUNS, WORKERS, LABORERS, PEASANTS, INTELLECTUALS,
PROFESSIONALS, AND WORKERS.  THEREFORE, THIS NEWS MADE ME HAPPY.  IT
MADE ME HAPPY BECAUSE WE HAVE AVOIDED THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO
WELCOME, IN NICARAGUA, THE PRESIDENT OF THAT GOVERNMENT OF
INTERNATIONAL KILLERS AND COMMON CRIMINALS.  [APPLAUSE]

   THE TRUTH IS THAT WE SHOULD FEEL PROUD.  AS A NICARAGUAN I FEEL
PROUD THAT THAT MURDEROUS GOVERNMENT HAS BROKEN RELATIONS WITH
NICARAGUA.  THAT IS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF, BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT
THEY KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEASANT, ON THE SIDE OF THE
SALVADORAN WORKER, ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN CHURCH AND PRIESTS,
THAT WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF PEACE, JUSTICE, AND DEMOCRACY IN EL
SALVADOR, AND THAT WE OPPOSE TYRANNY IN EL SALVADOR.

   I CAN SEE THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO SPEAK CLEARLY TO YOU.  I
BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SPEAK CLEARLY BECAUSE DIPLOMATIC
JARGON CAN SOMETIMES CONFUSE THINGS.  IT IS TIME THAT WE SPEAK
CLEARLY.  THE LEAST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CAN DO IN RESPONSE TO
THE ATTITUDE ASSUMED BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TO ASK AND DEMAND
OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE WORLD THAT IT BREAK RELATIONS
WITH THAT MURDEROUS AND CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT UNTIL THOSE WHO KILLED THE
PRIESTS HAVE BEEN PUNISHED, UNTIL THOSE WHO ARE KILLING THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUNISHED.  [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO
DEMAND.  THAT IS GOING TO BE OUR ANSWER.

   THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS UNEASY BECAUSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING
IN EL SALVADOR.  CRISTIANI IS NO TAME DOVE.  HE HAS BECOME AN
ACCOMPLICE AND INSTRUMENT OF THIS POLICY OF DEATH IMPLEMENTED BY THE
ARMY, BY MEN LIKE [COLONEL RENE EMILIO] PONCE AND [GENERAL
JUAN RAFAEL] BUSTILLO.  THEY ARE MURDEROUS GUARDSMEN JUST LIKE
THOSE YOU KNEW, THE SOMOZIST GUARDSMEN.  BUSTILLO, PONCE, AND A FEW
OTHERS ARE JUST LIKE THAT.  HOWEVER, NOT ALL OF THEM ARE LIKE THAT.
THERE ARE SOME HONEST SOLDIERS IN EL SALVADOR, SOLDIERS WITH HONEST
POSITIONS.  [CONTINUED]

HAS BEEN UNMASKED AS A FASCIST DICTATORSHIP.

   THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY MODEL TRIED TO LEGITIMIZE, THROUGH AN
ELECTORAL PROCESS, A QUOTE, DEMOCRATIC, UNQUOTE, GOVERNMENT WHICH
WOULD LEAVE THE GROWING POPULAR INSURGENCY IN EL SALVADOR WITH NO
REASON TO EXIST.  THAT MODEL HAS OVERWHELMINGLY FAILED BECAUSE,
INSTEAD OF AN EVEN TIMIDLY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, WHAT HAS BEEN
INSTALLED IS A REGIME THAT DOES NOT EVEN TOLERATE THE CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHICH IT VIEWS AS A GREAT TRAITOR TO THE FATHERLAND.
A REGIME HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WHICH DOES NOT PERMIT THE MOST MINIMAL
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FREE EXPRESSION OF THOUGHT.  IT DOES NOT
TOLERATE THE EXISTENCE OF AN OBJECTIVE AND INDEPENDENT NEWSCAST, SUCH
AS THAT OF TELEVISION CANAL DOCE.  IT IS A REGIME WHICH DEMANDS THAT
THE HIGHEST LEADERS OF THE CHURCH LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT DOES
NOT GUARANTEE THEIR SECURITY.  IT IS A REGIME THAT ISSUES TOTALLY
UNDEMOCRATIC LAWS AND CLOSES ALL POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES.  IN SHORT,
IT IS A REGIME IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY.  IT IS A FASCIST REGIME WITH
ALL ITS COMPONENTS.  THAT IS THE FINAL RESULT OF THE U.S. EFFORTS TO
ESTABLISH A COUNTERINSURGENT DEMOCRATIC REGIME IN EL SALVADOR.  THE
LITTLE LEGITIMACY THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AT ONE POINT ENJOYED
WAS DESTROYED WHEN IT HAD TO COVER UP AND PERMIT THE ASSASSINATION OF
SIX JESUIT PRIESTS TO GO UNPUNISHED, AND WHEN IT INDISCRIMINATELY
BOMBED THE MORE DENSELY POPULATED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY.

   A FEW DAYS OF THE OFFENSIVE HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO TEAR DOWN THE
FOUNDATIONS OF THE ERRONEOUS U.S. POLICY IN OUR COUNTRY.  AND THE
VALIDITY OF THAT POLICY HAS BEGUN TO BE SERIOUSLY QUESTIONED IN THE
UNITED STATES.

   A SECOND GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE FIRST WEEKS OF THE OFFENSIVE
HAS BEEN A RADICAL CHANGE IN THE THEATERS OF OPERATION.  WE HAVE
PLACED THE WAR IN ITS FINAL PHASE, IN ITS PHASE OF STRATEGIC
DEFINITION.  THERE HAS BEEN AN ABRUPT CHANGE IN WHAT HAD APPEARED TO
BE AN ENDLESS WAR AND AN UNBREAKABLE BALANCE OF FORCES.  THE TRANSFER
OF THE THEATERS OF OPERATION TO THE CITIES HAS RESULTED IN A STRATEGIC
SIEGE OF THE CITIES, WHICH ARE THE WEAK SPOTS OF THE POLITICAL,
ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL POWER. IN TURN, AS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY POINTED
OUT, THIS HAS BROUGHT ABOUT AN ACCELERATED POLITICAL BREAKDOWN OF THE
REGIME.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0879 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE
ENEMY IS LEFT LIKE THAT, HANGING FROM A THREAD -- A STRATEGIC THREAD
WHICH CAN BREAK AT ANY MOMENT AND RESULT IN A MILITARY SETBACK FOR THE
ARMY.  THE PHENOMENON WHICH ENSUED AFTER THE MASSES JOINED THE
OFFENSIVE IN ITS EARLY STAGES FORCED THE ENEMY TO INDISCRIMINATELY USE
THE AIR FORCE TO PREVENT A GENERAL UPRISING AND TO CURTAIL THE
INSURRECTION.  NEVERTHELESS, THE EFFORT EXERTED TO LAUNCH A NATIONWIDE
OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN BASED ON A LARGE-SCALE PEASANT AND SUBURBAN
INSURRECTION PROCESS.  OUR RANKS WERE CONSIDERABLY INCREASED TO RENDER
THE OFFENSIVE EFFECTIVE, AND THIS WAS POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE PEOPLE'S
GREAT INTEREST IN FIGHTING IN THE CITIES AND SPEEDING UP THE OUTCOME
OF THE WAR.  THE PEOPLE ALSO JOINED OUR RANKS DURING THE FIGHTING
WHICH OCCURRED IN THE CITIES.

   FURTHERMORE, THE GERM OF A NEW SOCIAL EXPLOSION HAS BEEN CREATED BY
THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF, WITH ITS INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND
REPRESSION.  EVEN THOUGH SOME PEOPLE MAY BLAME THE FMLN FOR THE ARMY'S
BRUTAL REACTION, FEW CAN FEEL ANY SYMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BOMBED
THEM.  THIS HAS CREATED A SOCIAL SITUATION WHICH GUARANTEES THE
CONTINUITY OF THE FMLN'S OFFENSIVE UNTIL VICTORY IS ACHIEVED.  ALL THE
PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE BOMBINGS ARE DISSATISFIED PEOPLE WHO WILL JOIN
THE STRUGGLE SOONER OR LATER.

   WE REMEMBER THE PHENOMENON OF THE DISPLACED PEOPLE AND REFUGEES
CAUSED BY THE BOMBINGS IN THE SALVADORAN COUNTRYSIDE.  THE BRUTAL
ATTITUDE OF THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE HAS LEGITIMIZED THE ARMED STRUGGLE.
THE OTHER PARTY, MEANING THE ENEMY, HAD TO GRAB ALL THE RESOURCES OF A
CONVENTIONAL WAR: AIRPLANES, HELICOPTERS, AND HEAVY ARTILLERY.  THIS
LEGITIMIZES THE PEOPLE'S ARMED STRUGGLE AND SELF-DEFENSE.

   A THIRD GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL AND STRATEGIC EFFORT
EXERTED AGAINST FASCISM HAS BEEN THE LIBERATION OF LARGE ZONES OF THE
NATIONAL TERRITORY.  A NEW, EMERGING POWER NOW CONTROLS EIGHT
DEPARTMENTS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE ARMY IS SPREAD THIN AND IT HAD TO
ABANDON THE ZONES WHERE IT CANNOT KEEP ITS MEN -- COMPROMISED AS IT IS
IN THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE OF THE CITIES.  THIS PUTS THE ARMY THROUGHOUT
THE NATIONAL TERRITORY IN A SITUATION RESEMBLING A CLOTH WITH MANY
HOLES, STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT AND THREATENING TO RIP AT ANY POINT.
THE TEAR CAN OCCUR WHEN LEAST EXPECTED.  LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE ARE
NOW IN THOSE LIBERATED TERRITORIES, ENGAGED IN A RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT
AND ORGANIZING A REARGUARD FOR THE MARCH ON THE CITIES.

   THERE IS A FOURTH ELEMENT TO CONSIDER: ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST
IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOW A BETTER BALANCE
FOR NEGOTIATIONS.  ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMANDS AND PROPOSALS AT
THE NEGOTIATION TABLE ARE COMPLETELY NULL AND VOID.  THE PRETENSE OF
DEMANDING THE FMLN'S SURRENDER IS UNTIMELY GIVEN SUCH A SHOW OF
STRENGTH.  NO ONE IN THE WORLD WOULD NOW BE WILLING TO BET ON THAT
POSITION.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0880 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THERE
IS NO LONGER ROOM FOR THE IDEA OF DIALOGUE WITHOUT NEGOTIATION.  NOW
WE MUST NEGOTIATE IN EARNEST.  THAT DEMAND HAS BEEN MADE BY SEVERAL
GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL FORUMS, AND EVEN BY SOME INFLUENTIAL
SECTORS IN THE UNITED STATES.  YET CRISTIANI HAS OPPOSED THIS
UNIVERSAL CURRENT.  CRISTIANI'S TACTICAL, PROPAGANDISTIC, AND DELAYING
MOVES AROUND THE NEGOTIATIONS TABLE WILL NO LONGER HAVE A CHANCE TO
SUCCEED.  ON THE OTHER HAND, IT WILL NOW BE AN INDISPENSABLE CONDITION
THAT DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION BE EXPANDED AND THAT THE REAL
DECISIONMAKERS BE THE ONES WHO SIT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.

   FINALLY, FOLLOWING THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN, THE
ANALYSTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, HAVE ADMITTED THAT THERE IS
A NEED TO CARRY OUT AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE VALUE OF THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR.  THE DEBATE ON THE
CONDITIONING, AND EVEN THE TOTAL SUSPENSION, OF MILITARY AID TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMY IS VERY INTENSE, AND IT HAS ALREADY SHAKEN THE
FOUNDATIONS OF BIPARTISANSHIP REGARDING U.S. SUPPORT FOR THE CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT.  YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE DEBATE HAS NOT CONTINUED BECAUSE
THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS DECLARED A RECESS; HOWEVER, IT WILL SOON BECOME
THE CENTER OF THE U.S. CONGRESS' DEBATES.

   IN SUMMARY, WE COULD SAY THAT THE ENEMY HAS LOST GROUND AND
LEGITIMACY, AND THE BASIS FOR ITS SUPPORT, THE U.S. AID, IS BEING
SERIOUSLY THREATENED.  IN ADDITION, THE ARMY HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THE
STRATEGIC DEFENSE OF AN IMPORTANT CENTER, THE CAPITAL CITY.
THEREFORE, IT IS ONLY LOGICAL TO SAY THAT TODAY WE SAW A VERY WORRIED,
EVEN DESPERATE, CRISTIANI.  CRISTIANI'S SPEECH ON THE RADIO AND
TELEVISION NETWORK SHOWS AN ATTEMPT TO RETOUCH THE PICTURE.  CRISTIANI
TRIED TO LOWER THE LEVEL OF THE WATER THAT HAS REACHED HIS NECK BY
DIVERTING THE WORLD'S ATTENTION FROM THE BOMBINGS AND THE DEATHS OF
THE JESUIT PRIESTS TO NICARAGUA.  IN THIS DESPERATE EFFORT, ALL THAT
CRISTIANI HAS DONE IS TO TAKE THE WAR TO OTHER AND MORE DANGEROUS
LEVELS.  HE IS ATTEMPTING TO REGIONALIZE THE WAR, AND THIS WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY ISOLATE HIM EVEN MORE FROM THE WORLD.

   THE OUTCOME OF THIS SITUATION DEPENDS ON ALL THESE FACTORS THAT CAN
ACCELERATE THE DECOMPOSITION OF FASCISM IN THE COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, THEY
DEPEND MOSTLY ON THE VIGOR AND STRENGTH THAT ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
PLACE ON THIS ONGOING AND IRREVERSIBLE STRUGGLE.

   BOGOTA, 27 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] AN AVIANCA BOEING 727 WITH 107
PEOPLE ON BOARD TODAY EXPLODED AT 07:18 HOURS (1218 GMT) ABOUT 22 KM
SOUTH OF BOGOTA, THE EL DORADO AIRPORT CONTROL TOWER IN BOGOTA
CONFIRMED.

   AERONAUTIC AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT A PLANE WITH REGISTRATION
NUMBER HK-1803 TRAVELING FROM BOGOTA TO CALI TOOK OFF AT 07:13 FROM
THE BOGOTA AIRPORT. A FEW MINUTES LATER, WITNESSES REPORTED TO BOGOTA
RADIO STATIONS THAT THE PLANE EXPLODED IN THE AIR, BROKE IN TWO, AND
BURST INTO FLAMES.

   OCTAVIO FONSECA, A WITNESS WHO WAS NEAR WHERE THE PLANE FELL TOLD
CADENA RADIAL COLOMBIANA (CARACOL) THAT "THE PLANE EXPLODED IN THE AIR
AND BROKE IN TWO."

   HE ADDED: "I HAVE ALREADY GONE TO WHERE THE PLANE FELL. THE PLANE
IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, NO SURVIVORS, ONLY BURNT AND MANGLED

   CLANDESTINE, 27 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION. PAY
CLOSE ATTENTION.  ATTENTION.  PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.  AS WE HAVE ALREADY
REPORTED, U.S.  OFFICIALS, IMPORTANT PERSONS, AND POLITICIANS IN THE
UNITED STATES HAVE ISSUED STATEMENTS AFFIRMING THAT THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS.
THE TESTIMONY GIVEN BY THE LADY WHO WITNESSED THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY CRIME HAS CAUSED POLITICAL UPHEAVAL THAT IS ALSO BEING FELT
IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE U.S.  CONGRESS, THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THE
PENTAGON.

   EVEN ELLIOTT ABRAMS, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, HAS STATED ON THE FACE THE NATION TELEVISION
PROGRAM ON 27 NOVEMBER, THAT THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS, A WOMAN,
AND HER DAUGHTER WAS AN ACTION BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND NOT
THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  ABRAMS,
A FORMER REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, STATED: BASED ON 10 YEARS
EXPERIENCE ON THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, I PRESUME THAT THE DEATH OF THE
PRIESTS WAS NOT THE WORK OF LEFTIST GUERRILLAS, BUT AN ACTION BY
FORCES OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION.  WE DO NOT HAVE A RECORD OF
GUERRILLAS TAKING THIS SORT OF ACTION, SAID ELLIOT ABRAMS.  HE ADDED
THAT, IN THE PAST, MANY MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH
THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS AND THE RIGHTIST SECTOR IN EL SALVADOR.
THESE WERE THE STATEMENTS BY ELLIOT ABRAMS.  VOA HAS REPORTED THE
STATEMENTS BY THE WOMAN WHO WITNESSED THE CRIME.  AT THIS TIME IN THE
UNITED STATES, THE SALVADORAN TOP MILITARY COMMAND, COLONEL RENE
EMILIO PONCE, AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE BEING POINTED OUT AS
THE PERSONS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ABOMINABLE CRIME.

   IN RELATION TO THIS, WE WANT TO DENOUNCE THE FOLLOWING TO THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA.  OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE CRISTIANI
ADMINISTRATION HAS TRIED TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE UNITED STATES
THAT IS PRESENTLY CENTERED ON THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND THE
INVOLVEMENT OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN THIS CRIME.  WE DENOUNCE
THE ARREST OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO AS PART OF A SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES PLAN TO ATTEMPT TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF INTERNATIONAL
PUBLIC OPINION FROM THE JESUITS' CASE.  WE ALSO DENOUNCE THE ARREST OF
JENNIFER CAZOLO AS A REPRESSIVE ACT.  ALSO, THE ARMED FORCES IS TRYING
TO LINK HUMANITARIAN AID FOR EL SALVADOR, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND U.S.-BASED
ORGANIZATIONS TO THE FMLN.  IT IS TRYING TO LINK THESE ORGANIZATIONS
AND THESE PERSONS TO THE FMLN.

   THE FMLN COMPLETELY DENIES THAT IT HAS ANY LINK WITH U.S. CITIZEN
JENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE DENOUNCE THIS ACCUSATION AS A CLUMSY SET UP BY
THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND, WHICH IS TRYING -- WE REPEAT -- TRYING TO
REPRESS THESE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.  THIS IS A
SET UP BY THE ARMED FORCES TO REPRESS FOREIGN CITIZENS AND -- WE
REPEAT -- IT IS A SMOKE SCREEN TO DIVERT U.S. ATTENTION FROM THE CASE
THAT IS PRESENTLY ON THE TABLE.  IT IS A SET UP TO NOT ATTEND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT
PRIESTS.

   IF ELLIOT ABRAMS, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN
AFFAIRS, WHO KNOWS SO MUCH ABOUT EL SALVADOR, SAYS THAT IT WAS NOT THE
FMLN AND THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY MILITARY UNITS AND PERSONS
LINKED TO THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, HIS STATEMENTS WILL HAVE
STRONG REPERCUSSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND
AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO
THROW A SMOKESCREEN HERE AND THERE TO TRY TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, ESPECIALLY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED
STATES.

   IN CONCLUSION, WE REAFIRM: WE DENY THE ARMED FORCES' ACCUSATIONS
AGAINST U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE STATE THAT THE ACCUSATION IS
A CLUMSY SET UP TO HIDE AND NOT RESPOND TO THE QUESTION EVERYONE IS
ASKING -- WHERE ARE THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS?  BEHIND THE CLUMSY
SET UP WITH REGARD TO THE U.S. CITIZEN, WE ALSO SEE THAT THEY INTEND
TO CONTINUE TO REPRESS HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND DIFFERENT
SECTORS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY WITH EL SALVADOR.  IN SHORT,
ALL THIS SET UP ATTEMPTS TO DO IS THROW A HUGE SMOKESCREEN TO REPRESS
THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.

   SANTIAGO, 27 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [EXCERPTS] THE
RADIO MINERIA SANTIAGO STAFF CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE SUBSTANTIAL
DAMAGE CAUSED BY A TERRORIST ATTACK AT THE OFFICES OF RADIO MINERIA.

   ERNANI VALDA, THE DIRECTOR OF THE RADIO STATION, HAS REPORTED
THAT SO FAR THE DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED AT 2.5 MILLION PESOS.

   THE BOMB WAS PLACED IN THE OFFICE OF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR GERMAN
GAMONAL, WHO IS ALSO THE PRESS DIRECTOR.  FIVE PEOPLE WERE WORKING AT
THE OFFICES WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED; ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED.

   WE SPOKE WITH REPORTER HERMOGENES CARRILLO, WHO ARRIVED AT THE
RADIO STATION OFFICES AFTER THE ATTACK.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CARRILLO] ONE PERSON SUFFERED MINOR INJURIES AND
THE OFFICES OF RADIO MINERIA WERE SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED DURING THE
BOMB ATTACK HERE AT THE INTERSECTION OF PROVIDENCIA AND TOBALABA
STREETS THIS MORNING AT 0510. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE RADIO STATION WAS OFF THE AIR FOR 45 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME
CARABINEROS PERSONNEL INSPECTED THE SITE TO CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE NO
OTHER BOMBS.

   GOPE [SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP] PERSONNEL ARRIVED LATER.
ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIALIZED PERSONNEL THE BOMB CONTAINED TRONEX
[EXPANSION UNKNOWN], AND IT HAD BEEN PLACED BY ONE OF THE WINDOWS ON
PROVIDENCIA STREET.

   AT LEAST TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE ATTACK.  THEY
SOMEHOW CLIMBED TO THE SECOND FLOOR, PLACED THE BOMB, LIT THE FUSE,
AND FLED.

   NO WARNING WAS RECEIVED NOR HAS ANY SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENT CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK SO FAR.

   WE HAVE RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS FROM OUR LISTENERS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.  WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED IMPORTANT POLITICAL PERSONALITIES,
INCLUDING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERNAN BUCHI AND INTERIOR MINISTER
CARLOS CACERES.

   AMONG OTHERS, WE HAVE RECEIVED A CALL FROM OSORNO FROM
[PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE] FRANCISCO JAVIER ERRAZURIZ AND
ANOTHER CALL FROM SANTIAGO FROM RICARDO LAGOS.

   THIS IS ALL WE CAN REPORT FOR NOW.  THE COST HAS NOT YET BEEN
ESTIMATED, BUT IT WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL.

   THIS WAS A REPORT BY RADIO MINERIA FOR RADIO NACIONAL DE CHILE.

   BOGOTA, 27 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] POLICE SOURCES HAVE DESCRIBED THE
ANNONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALL TO RADIO CADENA CARACOL BLAMING "THE
EXTRADITABLES" DRUG TRAFFICKING GROUP FOR THE EXPLOSION ON BOARD AN
AVIANCA BOEING 727 AS "LACKING CREDIBILITY."  THE PLANE WAS ON A
FLIGHT FROM BOGOTA TO CALI WITH 107 PERSONS ABOARD. THE ANNONYMOUS
CALLER SAID THAT "THE EXTRADITABLES" HAD PLANTED A BOMB ON THAT PLANE
BECAUSE "FIVE INFORMERS" WERE ABOARD.

   HOWEVER, POLICE SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE WERE SKEPTICAL, DESCRIBING
WHAT THE ANNONYMOUS CALLER HAD SAID AS LACKING CREDIBILITY. ANOTHER
POLICE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE ANNONYMOUS PHONE CALL BLAMING "THE
EXTRADITABLES" FOR THE EXPLOSION SOUNDED MORE LIKE A JOKE IN BAD
TASTE.  HE ADDED THAT THE CALL DOES NOT FOLLOW THE NORMAL PATTERN USED
BY THAT GROUP WHEN CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACTIONS. THE GROUP
USUALLY SENDS COMMUNIQUES TO THE MEDIA.  THESE COMMUNIQUES ARE WRITTEN
ON PAPER WITH THE GROUP'S LETTERHEAD AND ARE DULY SIGNED, AND AT TIMES
INCLUDE THE FINGERPRINTS OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING THE
COMMUNIQUE.

   A SPOKESPERSON AT EL DORADO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN BOGOTA, FROM
WHERE THE PLANE TOOK OFF, SAID THAT IT WAS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR
SOMEONE TO HAVE EVADED THE STRICT SECURITY AT THE AIRPORT. THE SOURCE
ADDED THAT THE PASSENGERS AND THE LUGGAGE UNDERWENT ROUTINE BUT
RIGOROUS SECURITY CHECKS.  THESE SECURITY CHECKS INCLUDE HAND CHECKS
AND THE USE OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AND EXPLOSIVES-DETECTING DOGS.
THE SOURCE ADDED THAT NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS NOTICED.

   "THE EXTRADITABLES" IS AN ARMED GROUP UNDER THE MEDELLIN CARTEL
THAT FOR THE PAST 6 YEARS HAS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THE EXTRADITION OF
COLOMBIANS TO THE UNITED STATES.  UP TO NOW THE CRIMES THAT THE GROUP
HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND OTHERS FOR WHICH IT IS BLAMED,
HAVE ALL FALLEN UNDER THE CATEGORY OF SELECTIVE MURDERS BUT NEVER AN
INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK LIKE DESTROYING A PLANE.

   CIVIL AERONAUTICS DIRECTORATE SOURCES SAID THAT THE BLACK BOX HAS
BEEN FOUND AND THAT ITS CONTENTS WILL PROBABLY REVEAL WHAT HAPPENED.

   THE SOURCES ADDED THAT 8 HOURS AFTER THE TRAGEDY, THERE ARE STILL
NO CLUES THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE WHETHER THIS WAS
AN ATTACK OR AN ACCIDENT.

   MOST OF THE PASSENGERS ON BOARD THE PLANE WERE GOVERNMENT AND
PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE TRAVELING FROM BOGOTA TO CALI, IN THE
SOUTHEASTERN SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY, FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.

PILOT MAURICIO QUIROS GARCIA BY LUIS CABRERA] [TEXT] [CABRERA] THE
ALLEGED NICARAGUAN PILOT THAT WAS KILLED IN EL SALVADOR IS ALIVE AND
WELL, IN MANAGUA, TALKING WITH US.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SAID
MAURICIO QUIROS GARCIA WAS KILLED IN AN ALLEGED TRANSSHIPMENT OF
WEAPONS LAST SATURDAY, 25 NOVEMBER WHEN A CESSNA PLANE CRASHED.
MAURICIO QUIROS GARCIA, 36-YEARS-OLD, IS HERE, NEXT TO ME.  HE IS
MARRIED AND HAS CHILDREN.  GOOD EVENING, MAURICIO.

   [QUIROS GARCIA] GOOD EVENING.  I AM SO SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED
OVER THIS REPORT, THAT I REALLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN HOW I FELT
WHEN I WAS CALLED.  AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE.  HOWEVER, AFTER
RECEIVING SEVERAL TELEPHONE CALLS FROM SEVERAL NEWSMEN, I STARTED TO
THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THIS.  I WANT TO CLARIFY AND EXPLAIN THAT THIS
REPORT IS TOTALLY FALSE.

   [CABRERA] MAURICIO, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SAYS YOU ARE A FORMER
PILOT OF THE SANDINIST AIR FORCE, FAS.  IS THAT TRUE?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] THAT IS TRUE.  I WAS IN THE FAS FOR 2 YEARS, AND
NOW, I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH AERONICA FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS.

   [CABRERA] WHAT TYPES OF FLIGHTS DO YOU MAKE?  TO WHERE DO YOU FLY
AND FROM WHERE?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] THEY ARE INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS.  I AM THE CAPTAIN
OF A BOEING 727.  WE FLY TO PANAMA CITY; SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA; MEXICO
CITY, AND GUATEMALA CITY.

   [CABRERA] WHERE DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] IN MEXICO.

   [CABRERA] WERE YOU EVER INVOLVED WITH THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY TYPE OF
WEAPONS?  THE REPORTS MENTION SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT.  DID YOU JUST
UNLOAD ALL THAT IN EL SALVADOR, AND TURNED AROUND SO QUICKLY, THAT YOU
WERE IN SEVERAL PLACES ON SATURDAY?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] I DO NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST NOTION ABOUT
SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS, OR ANYTHING ELSE.  MY JOB IS TO PILOT A PLANE,
AND THAT IS WHAT I DO; I PILOT THE AERONICA PLANE AND THAT IS IT.

   [CABRERA] MAURICIO, DO YOU KNOW THE FMLN WELL?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] NO, I DO NOT KNOW ANYONE FROM THE FMLN.  I HAVE NO
RELATIONS WITH ANYONE LINKED AT ALL TO THE FMLN.

   [CABRERA] SO WHY SHOULD ANYONE WANT TO REPORT THAT YOU WERE KILLED
EARLY IN THE MORNING IN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] WELL, AS I SAID BEFORE, THAT REPORT HAS SURPRISED
ME.  FRANKLY SPEAKING, I DO NOT KNOW.  THIS SHOWS THAT CERTAIN
GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES ISSUE TOTALLY FALSE REPORTS IN ORDER TO HIDE OR,
I DO NOT KNOW [CHANGES THOUGHT] THAT REPORT IS TOTALLY FALSE.  THAT IS
ALL I CAN SAY.  AS YOU CAN SEE, I AM VERY CONCERNED, AND JUST AS
SURPRISED AS YOU ARE.  [CONTINUED]

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 27 NOV 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [SPEECH]
[NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA, IN PROGRESS] [TEXT] EL SALVADOR
HAS CARRIED OUT A CONSTANT AND PERMANENT AGGRESSION AGAINST NICARAGUA
AND NICARAGUA HAS NEVER SUGGESTED BREAKING RELATIONS WITH EL SALVADOR.
NICARAGUA HAS NOT EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT BREAKING RELATIONS WITH HONDURAS.
ON THE CONTRARY, WE HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO FOLLOW A POLICY OF
NEGOTIATIONS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.  I DO NOT BELIEVE IN FOOLING
OURSELVES.  THE REAL PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS MADE A COMMITMENT, AND THAT COMMITMENT MUST BE FULFILLED.
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS MADE A COMMITMENT TO MOBILIZE THE
CONTRAS; THAT COMMITMENT MUST BE FULFILLED.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS ALSO COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN
CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THAT COMMITMENT MUST ALSO BE FULFILLED.  EL
SALVADOR MUST FULFILL THAT COMMITMENT. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS
NOT RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR, THEY ARE KILLING PEOPLE IN
EL SALVADOR, THEY HAVE BOMBED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE
KILLED THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

   IN LIGHT OF ALL THIS, THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT MUST EXPRESS ITS
SOLIDARITY WITH THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE; THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE THE
ONES WHO ARE SUFFERING.  WE CANNOT BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH AN ARMY THAT
IS KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  LET US WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY
GOVERNMENTS WILL SUPPORT THAT ARMY WHICH IS KILLING THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, AN ARMY THAT IS BOMBING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AN ARMY THAT
HAS KILLED THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  LET US WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY
GOVERNMENTS WILL SUPPORT THE ARMY.  I ASSURE YOU THAT MOST OF THE
PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD WILL EXPRESS THEIR
SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   SHORTLY BEFORE COMING HERE THIS EVENING, I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS
VIA SATELLITE, AND I SAW PROTEST DEMOSTRATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.
THE PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE
BOMBINGS IN EL SALVADOR.  CHRISTIANS, CATHOLICS, CLERGYMEN, AND
PRIESTS ARE PROTESTING IN THE UNITED STATES [WORDS INDISTINCT].
THEREFORE, OUR POSITION IS QUITE CLEAR.  WE DO NOT RENOUNCE THE PEACE
AGREEMENTS.  WE CONTINUE TO DEFEND THEM, AND WE WILL DEMAND THAT THE
AGREEMENTS BE FULFILLED.  WE ARE GOING TO DEMAND THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT RESPECT THOSE AGREEMENTS AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS.  WHAT IS
NEEDED IN EL SALVADOR IS A CEASE-FIRE.  A REAL CEASE-FIRE AND
NEGOTIATIONS ARE NEEDED IN EL SALVADOR TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL
ALLOW PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.  NO ONE CAN BE HAPPY WITH
THAT KIND OF A DEMOCRATIC REGIME -- LIKE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DESCRIBE IT. THAT GOVERNMENT IS KNOWN FOR
KILLING PEOPLE, FOR KILLING CLERGYMEN.  HUMAN RIGHTS MUST BE RESPECTED
IN EL SALVADOR.

   I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL THE COMRADES WHO CAME FROM THE VARIOUS REGIONS
TO BE HERE TONIGHT TO ATTEND THIS MEETING DURING WHICH, IN ADDITION TO
DISCUSSING SEVERAL MATTERS OF INTEREST FOR ALL THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE,
WE ALSO HONORED OUR EVANGELISTIC BROTHERS WHO HAVE WORKED HERE IN
NICARAGUA FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS AND GAVE
 POSTHUMOUS RECOGNITION TO OUR JESUIT BROTHERS, THE PRIESTS BRUTALLY
MURDERED IN EL SALVADOR.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] WE ARE DETERMINED TO        
CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, THE PREACHERS OF THE
GOSPEL, THE EVANGELISTS AND ALL THE CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY, FOR A

BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND REVOLUTION, THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 27 NOV 89 (RADIO PEACE AND PROGRESS) -- [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS REJETED THE PROPOSAL FOR AN IMMEDIATE
CEASE-FIRE THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN],
ACCORDING TO MAURICIO SANDOVAL, SALVADORAN MINISTER OF CULTURE AND
COMMUNICATIONS.  SANDOVAL WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE U.S.  NEWS AGENCY
UPI.

   THE SALVADORAN PATRIOTS MADE THIS PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO THE OAS
RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE SALVADORAN SITUATION.  THE RECOMMENDATION
CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS.  BISHOP GREGORIO ROSA
CHAVEZ OFFERED HIS GOOD OFFICES.  VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES
PEREZ HAS ALSO JOINED THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO STOP THE
VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR.  ON TUESDAY, 21 NOVEMBER, PEREZ MET WITH
OFFICIALS OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, NAMELY JUSTICE MINISTER
OSCAR SANTAMARIA AND MINISTER OF PRESIDENCY JUAN PADELA.

   ACCORDING TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, HE ALSO TALKED WITH HIS
SALVADORAN COUNTERPART ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE PHONE.  IN THE COURSE
OF THIS TALK HE OFFERED TO HOST A CARACAS MEETING BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS.

   IT WOULD SEEM THAT BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDE OF CRISTIANI'S
ADMINISTRATION, ALL THESE EFFORTS HAVE NOT YIELDED THE EXPECTED
FRUITS.  THE FACT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO
WORSEN THE TERROR.  WITH THIS IN MIND, THE GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING A
LAW TO PUNISH THE OPPOSITION.  AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE, CONGRESS HAS
ALREADY APPROVED ANTITERRORIST BILLS.  THESE BILLS ALLOW THE ARREST OF
PEOPLE ON SUSPICION OF ANTIGOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES.

   A SALVADORAN DEPUTY HAS LABELED THESE BILLS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND
CONTRARY TO HUMAN RIGHTS.  MEANWHILE, THESE BILLS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE
ACURSED DEATH SQUADS.  AMERICAS WATCH, A HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION,
HAS REPORTED AN INCREASE OF [WORD INDISTINCT], ARRESTS OF AND THREATS
AGAINST FOREIGNERS WHO WORK FOR RELIGIOUS AND HUMANITARIAN
ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR.

   THE SALVADORAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE CRUSADE
AGAINST FOREIGN MISSIONARIES IS ENCOURAGED BY THE ULTRARIGHTISTS WHO
ARE OPERATING UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT
GUARANTEES THE REACTIONARIES THEIR IMPUNITY.

   DEATH SQUADS, WORKING CLOSELY WITH REACTIONARY MILITARY MEN AND THE
CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, ARE MOST CERTAINLY TO BLAME FOR THE RECENT
DISGRACEFUL MURDER OF SIX PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO THE
U.S. PUBLICATION THE BOSTON GLOBE.  THE PAPER STATES THAT THIS IS
OBVIOUS TO ALL AND THAT THE SALVADORAN REGIME AND THE YANKEE
GOVERNMENT ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT REFUSE TO ADMIT IT.

   FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW THIS ATTITUDE IS REASONABLE.  WASHINGTON'S
POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR IS BASED ON THE ULTRARIGTHWING FORCES [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  THE BOSTON GLOBE ADDS THAT EVERY YEAR THE TAXPAYERS TAKE
OUT OF THEIR POCKETS $500 MILLION TO FINANCE THE ASSISTANCE THAT THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT GIVES TO EL SALVADOR.  SOME OF THIS MONEY GOES TO THE
DEATH SQUADS WHICH ARE GUILTY OF THOUSANDS OF MURDERS COMMITED AMID
HELLISH TORTURES.  IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF INFORMATION.

   THE THING IS THAT U.S. OFFICIALS PREFER TO LASH OUT AT THE
FICTITIOUS SHIPMENTS OF SOVIET WEAPONS TO EL SALVADOR, FICTITIOUS
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN NONE AT ALL.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE USE THAT
SUCCESSIVE SALVADORAN REGIMES HAVE MADE OF U.S. AID, HAS ALWAYS BEEN
DOWNPLAYED.  HOWEVER, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WITHOUT THE HEFTY U.S.
SUBSIDIES, THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED A LONG
TIME AGO AND THE NEARLY 100,000 SALVADORANS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE
STRUGGLE, WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

AFTER THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE FIGHT BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND
THE GUERRILLAS.  MIKHAIL MAYOROV FILED THIS REPORT:

   THE HORRIFYING REPORTS PUBLISHED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES GIVE AN
APPROPRIATE IDEA OF THE TRAGEDY IN EL SALVADOR, WHERE A CIVIL WAR IS
RAVAGING THE COUNTRY.  ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE
FIGHT IS BEING WAGED, THE PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO BURN DEAD BODIES RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSES.

   THE VICTIMS ARE NOT ONLY SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS, WHO ARE DIRECTLY
INVOLVED IN THE CONFLICT, BUT ALSO CIVILIANS, WHOSE HOUSES ARE HIT BY
BOMBS AND PROJECTILES.  THE CIVILIANS ARE CONSTANTLY THREATENED BY THE
BULLIES OF THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS, WHO MURDERED SIX CATHOLIC
PRIESTS AT THE SAN SALVADOR UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.

   THE SALVADORAN SITUATION, WHICH HAS CAUSED SERIOUS CONCERN, CANNOT
BE REGARDED AS SOMETHING WHICH IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE WORLD NOW SEEMS TO BE
STRONGER THAN EVER.  WE HAVE FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE OLD
SAYING THAT THERE IS NO ISOLATED TRAGEDY.  WE FEEL INCREASINGLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SO-CALLED HOT SPOTS OF THE
PLANET.

   OBVIOUSLY, THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE TO NORMALIZE THE SITUATION IS
TO STEM THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT FLOW OF MILITARY SUPPLIES TO BOTH
SIDES.

   MOSCOW HAS ALREADY TAKEN THIS POSITION.  HOWEVER, U.S. PRESIDENT
GEORGE BUSH HAS TERMED INADMISSIBLE THE POSSIBILITY OF HALTING THE AID
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   IF WE COMPARE THE SALVADORAN AND THE AFGHAN SITUATIONS, WHY DOES
THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION SO BITTERLY REPPROACHED US FOR HELPING THE
NAJIBULLAH REGIME?

   WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY NOT YET ADOPTED GENERAL CRITERIA.

   OUR FOREIGN POLICY IS CONSISTENT, MAYOROV SAYS. IN MY OPINION,
SOVIET DIPLOMACY HAS A MORE FLEXIBLE ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CURRENT
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.  THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT HAS ABANDONED ITS
CONSERVATIVE STAND, WHICH MADE US SUPPORT JUST ONE SIDE.  IN THE FINAL
ANALYSIS, THE WAR IS A TRAGEDY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE, AND THE MAGNITUDE
OF THE TRAGEDY GROWS AS THE CONFLICT BECOMES MORE SERIOUS.

   THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WILL REFLECT THE WILLINGNESS THAT MOSCOW
AND WASHINGTON HAVE TO HELP A SMALL NATION, WHICH IS TIRED OF A 
LONG-STANDING CONFLICT, FIND A WAY TOWARDS PEACE.

   ALL OF US ARE WAITING FOR THE SOVIET-U.S. SUMMIT WHICH WILL BE HELD
OFF THE COAST OF MALTA.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE ISSUES THAT
WILL BE ON THE AGENDA BECAUSE THE MEETING WILL BE UNOFFICIAL [AS
HEARD].

   THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT MAY BE ADDRESSED IN A BILATERAL SUMMIT.
IT IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE, HOWEVER, THAT BOTH SIDES REACH AN
UNDERSTANDING AND THAT THEY IDENTIFY THE POSSIBILITIES OF COOPERATION
FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PROBLEM.

YOUR GOVERNMENT BY REFUSING TO AGREE TO THE CEASE-FIRE WITH

ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS WHICH INCLUDE A COMMITMENT TO HAVE
DEMOCRATIZATION, A CEASE-FIRE, AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.  THIS,

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 28 NOV 89 (PL) -- [TEXT] HEAVY CLASHES ARE
STILL TAKING PLACE IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR FOLLOWING A NIGHT OF
FIERCE COMBAT, WHICH CONFIRMS PREDICTIONS ON THE INTENSIFICATION OF
THE WAR THIS WEEK.

   PRESS REPORTS RELEASED FROM SAN SALVADOR AT NOON TODAY REPORT THE
CONTINUATION OF CLASHES BETWEEN THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] AND THE ARMED FORCES, BASICALLY IN
NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.

   AYUTUXTEPEQUE, SOYAPANGO, ZACAMIL, AND SAN RAMON, ON THE OUTSKIRTS
OF SAN SALVADO, SEEM TO HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED AGAIN BY GUERRILLA COLUMNS,
WHICH CONTROLLED THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS DURING THE FIRST DAYS OF THE
NATIONAL OFFENSIVE WHICH BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   IN ITS MOST RECENT NEWSCAST, THE FMLN'S RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED
THE AIR FORCE HEAVILY BOMBED AYUTUXTEPEQUE, A DENSELY POPULATED
NEIGHBORHOOD, AND CONFIRMED THE CLASHES TAKING PLACE IN SOYAPANGO.

   THE SOURCE REPORTED THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ELITE TROOPS, AND
EVEN INFANTRY BRIGADES FROM MILITARY DETACHMENTS TRADITIONALY
STATIONED IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO SAN SALVADOR IN AN
ATTEMPT TO REPEL THE REBELS' ACTIONS.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLA REPORTS, DESPITE THE CONTINUOUS
BOMBINGS, CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE AT THIS TIME IN THE CAPITAL OF SAN
MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.  SEVERAL
SECTORS OF THE PANAMERICAN HIGHWAY, ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN SAN
SALVADOR, REMAIN UNDER THE FMLN CONTROL, RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED.

   THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MEDIA TODAY WARNED ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF
THE INCIDENTS IN SAN SALVADOR THIS MORNING, WHEN GROUPS OF
UNIDENTIFIED MEN MACHINEGUNNED FORMER SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO GUERRERO, A WELL- KNOWN LEADER OF THE RIGHTWING NATIONAL
CONCILIATION PARTY. SOURCES CONSULTED IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH PREFER
NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED, SAID IT IS A FACT THE FAR RIGHTWING IS LINKED TO
THIS CRIME.  THE SAME SOURCES MAINTAINED THAT THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT
ON THE SUSPENSION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MANAGUA, MADE BY
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, CAUSED DISAGREEMENTS AMONG THE GOVERNMENT
BRANCHES AND AMONG THE VARIOUS PARTIES.  


DEV-MUC3-0891 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, 28 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE
RECEIVED A REPORT ADVISING US THAT AT 0200 [0800 GMT] TODAY, FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FORCES ATTACKED A GROUP OF
PARATROOPERS AT THE INSA [EXPANSION UNKNOWN] FACTORY IN SOYAPANGO.
THE REPORT ALSO ADDS THAT SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING, FIGHTING HAS BEEN
GOING ON IN GUADALUPE NEIGHBORHOOD, ALSO IN SOYAPANGO.  REPORTS FROM
OTHER AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR SPEAK OF HEAVY CLASHES SINCE EARLY THIS
MORNING.  THE REPORT STATES THAT AT 0200 TODAY, FMLN UNITS ATTACKED
TWO 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE COBRA BATTALION COMPANIES IN SAN SALVADOR.
THE TROOPS WERE IN EL CARMEN HILL, AYUTUXTEPEQUE JURISDICTION.  THE
REPORT ADDS THAT THE FMLN INFLICTED TWO DEAD AND THREE WOUNDED,
INCLUDING A SERGEANT AND A CORPORAL.  THIS MEANS THAT THE 4TH INFANTRY
BRIGADE IS ALREADY IN SAN SALVADOR.  THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE IN SAN
SALVADOR: SONSONATE TROOPS, 5TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, AND 4TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS ARE IN SAN SALVADOR.  THIS IS PROOF OF HOW BAD
THE ENEMY IS DOING.

   THE REPORT ADDS THAT SINCE THIS MORNING, FIGHTING AGAINST ATLACATL
BATTALION TROOPS WAS REPORTED IN THE AREA AROUND EL CARMEN HILL.  THE
ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS WERE GOING TO REINFORCE THE COWARDLY 4TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, WHO HAVE LEFT CHALATENANGO AND ARE NOW IN SAN
SALVADOR.  THE FIGHTING ENDED AT 0930 [1530 GMT].

   WE REPEAT: AT 0200 TODAY, FMLN UNITS ATTACKED A GROUP OF
PARATROOPERS AT THE INSA FACTORY IN SOYAPANGO.  FIGHTING WAS ALSO
REPORTED IN SAN JACINTO, MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, SOYAPANGO, SANTA
EDUVIGES, ESCANDIA NEIGHBORHOOD, EL CARMEN NEIGHBORHOOD, AND OTHER
AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR.  WE ARE WAITING FOR MORE REPORTS BECAUSE WE
HAVE LEARNED THAT FIGHTING HAS RESUMED IN THE CAPITAL CITY.

   TO ADD TO THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WE WISH TO
STATE THAT HEAVY FIGHTING OCCURRED THIS MORNING IN GUADALUPE
NEIGHBORHOOD, SOYAPANGO.  AT 0600 [1200 GMT], NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS
WERE AMBUSHED AT KM 11 ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD.  THE NATIONAL GUARD
SUFFERED DEAD AND WOUNDED DURING THAT AMBUSH.  WE WILL HAVE MORE
INFORMATION ON THIS AMBUSH LATER.  


DEV-MUC3-0892 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
[BEGIN RECORDING] [COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] THIS AGAIN PROVES THE
AGGRESSION BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AGAINST POOR PEOPLE, AND AGAINST OUR
COUNTRY'S DISTINGUISHED POLITICIANS.  THIS IS ADDED TO THE INNOCENT
LIVES TAKEN BY THE FMLN FROM THE SALVADORAN POPULATION.  I WANT TO
TELL YOU WE HAVE A PERSON UNDER ARREST WHO WAS WOUNDED RIGHT WHERE THE
ATTACK TOOK PLACE, BY DR. GUERRERO'S BODYGUARD.  WE HAVE HIS IDENTITY,
HE IS AFFILITATED TO THE FMLN, BUT WE WILL NOT RELEASE HIS NAME WHILE
THE INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE THE BEST
WITNESS TO THE FMLN AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR PEOPLE. [END RECORDING]

   [ANNOUNCER] PONCE ALSO SAID THAT THE TERRORISTS CARRY OUT THESE
ACTIONS AS PART OF THEIR STRATEGY TO SCARE THE POPULATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE WANT TO SAY THAT CONDITIONS TO ENABLE
MARXISM AND THE FMLN TO WIN ARE PRACTICALLY NIL.  THE PEOPLE
COMPLETELY REJECT THEM.  THE FMLN ARE USING THAT LYING AND LOSING
VENCEREMOS RADIO STATION TO FOOL THEIR OWN CADRES.  IN NICARAGUA,
THERE WERE SOME STATIONS THAT WERE IN NETWORK WITH THIS LYING AND
LOSING VENCEREMOS RADIO STATION, BROADCASTING FALSE REPORTS ABOUT EL
SALVADOR.  THIS IS ALSO PART OF THE AGGRESSION.  TO ALLOW THEIR
SO-CALLED HIGH-RANKING FMLN COMMANDERS TO BE IN NICARAGUA IS ALSO PART
OF THE AGGRESSION.  NO ONE CAN IGNORE THE AGGRESSION THAT THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN EXERTING FOR A LONG TIME AGAINST THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE.

   [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] HAVING FOUND THESE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS,
DOES IT MEAN YOU MAY EXPECT THE AGGRESSIVE COUNTEROFFENSIVE THESE
GROUPS ARE LAUNCHING MAY WIDEN?

   [PONCE] DEFINITELY NOT.  WE BELIEVE THEIR CADRES ARE DECIMATED.
THIS COULD AFFECT MAINLY OUR AIR FORCE; HOWEVER, WE ARE TAKING THE
PROPER TACTICAL AND TECHNICAL PREVENTIVE MEASURES.  WHAT SHOULD BE
VERY CLEAR TO ALL SALVADORANS IS THAT FOR THE FMLN TO ATTAIN POWER,
WHICH IS THEIR GOAL, THEY WILL HAVE TO CLIMB OVER THE BODY OF THE LAST
ARMED FORCES SOLDIER.  [END RECORDING]

   [ANNOUNCER] PONCE ALSO SAID THAT THE MISSILES AND OTHER WEAPONS
SENT BY ORTEGA FOR THE FMLN ARE AGRESSIONS AGAINST THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, EXPLAINING THAT IT WAS A NICARAGUAN WHO LIVES IN THIS CAPITAL
WHO IDENTIFIED THE MAN WHO PILOTED THE SMALL AIRCRAFT CARRYING THE
WEAPONS FOR THE TERRORISTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] HE SAID THAT IT WAS QUIROS GARCIA.
HOWEVER, THAT EVENING HE CALLED BACK AND SAID THAT THE PILOT SHOULD
HAVE PART OF HIS THUMB MISSING, AND TO PLEASE CHECK HIM OUT.  THE BODY
WE HAVE WAS CHECKED AND ONE OF THE THUMBS HAS A PART MISSING.  TO US
THIS IS IRREFUTABLE PROOF.  WE ALL KNOW OF ORTEGA'S CYNCISM.  ON THE
ONE HAND, HE MADE PROMISES AT ESQUIPULAS II, SIGNING AGREEMENTS HE WAS
NOT PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT; HE WOULD NOT DO IT SINCE HE WAS REALLY
DOING THESE OTHER THINGS.  HE IS THE SAME AS THE FMLN. THE FMLN WAS
DISCUSSING PEACE AT A DIALOGUE TABLE WHILE IT WAS PREPARING FOR THIS
OFFENSIVE.  IT IS A MOCKERY OF THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEIR DESIRE FOR
PEACE HAS BEEN FOOLED WITH.  DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION
HAVE BEEN FOOLED.  [END RECORDING]

   [ANNOUNCER] FINALLY, PONCE SAID THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS HAVE LOW
MORALE AND ARE DESPERATE, BECAUSE IF DANIEL ORTEGA LOSES THE
ELECTIONS, THEY, TOO, WILL LOSE, AND FOREVER.  ADDITIONALLY, THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR IRRATIONAL ACTIONS THAT ONLY
PRODUCE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THERE IS
PROFOUND INDIGNATION OVER THE MURDER OF DR.  FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO,
PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE.  THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED
BY TERRORISTS AT ABOUT 0930 [1530 GMT] THIS MORNING.  ACCORDING TO
WITNESSES, THE TERRORISTS DROVE A YELLOW VOLKSWAGEN.

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ORDERED A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION TO
DETERMINE WHO MURDERED DR GUERRERO AND TO BRING THEM TO TRIAL
ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN PENAL CODE, WHICH WAS MODIFIED A FEW DAYS
AGO.  BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS HAVE SPOKEN OUT AGAINST THESE
CRIMES, BECAUSE THEY ONLY BRING MORE GRIEF AND PAIN TO THE SUFFERING
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.


DEV-MUC3-0894 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] AT LEAST 9 PEOPLE HAVE DIED
AND 13 MORE WERE WOUNDED -- INCLUDING SOLDIERS, REBELS, AND CIVILIANS
-- IN THE ARMED CONFRONTATIONS DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS IN SAN
SALVADOR AND 2 DEPARTMENTS IN THE NORTH AND EAST OF EL SALVADOR,
ACCORDING TO MILITARY REPORTS.

   FOUR GUERRILLAS DIED AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED IN
CONFRONTATIONS THAT OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE CITIES OF
MEJICANOS AND CIUDAD DELGADO, LOCATED NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, ACCORDING
TO THE SAME REPORTS.

   THE CONFRONTATIONS, IN WHICH CARBINES, MORTARS, AND EXPLOSIVES WERE
USED, BEGAN AT 0230 (0830 GMT), WHEN THE REBELS "TRIED TO ENTER" THE
NORTHERN SUBURBS OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT THEY WERE "REPELLED" BY
GOVERNMENT TROOPS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE AIR FORCE, ACCORDING TO THE
ARMY'S PRESS OFFICE.

   ANOTHER FOUR GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND TWO WERE WOUNDED IN ARMED
CONFRONTATIONS IN TONACATEPEQUE, 16 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, AND IN
CHALATENANGO AND SAN MIGUEL, LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS
OF THE COUNTRY, RESPECTIVELY.

   THE ARMY HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ONE SOLDIER DIED AND ANOTHER FIVE
WERE WOUNDED IN THOSE PLACES.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE STATED THAT FOUR EMPLOYEES OF THE RIO LEMPA
HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION WERE WOUNDED BY EXPLOSIVES THAT HAD
BEEN PLACED BY THE REBELS IN A TECHNICAL INSTITUTE LOCATED IN THE
ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED FOR SOME DAYS BY THE
REBELS DURING THE RECENT OFFENSIVE.

   THE ARMY ALSO INDICATES THAT THE REBELS SET FIRE TO A CAR AND
ANOTHER TWO VEHICLES IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL.


DEV-MUC3-0895 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT]
[SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT] [TEXT] IN LIGHT OF THE TERRORIST ARMED
AGGRESSION LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BY THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WITH THE OPEN SUPPORT AND
DIRECTION OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HEADED BY DANIEL ORTEGA ON 11
NOVEMBER, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ADVISES THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY THAT ON THE DAY THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT ASSUMED OFFICE, IT
EXPRESSED ITS FIRM DESIRE TO SEEK, THROUGH THE CIVILIZED PATH OF
DIALOGUE, A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT BECAUSE THE MARXIST
- LENINIST GROUP'S CAUSE BRINGS BLOODSHED TO OUR PEOPLE.  IN THIS
SENSE, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT PROMOTED THE PROCESS OF
DIALOGUE THAT BEGAN IN MEXICO CITY ON 13, 14, AND 15 SEPTEMBER 1989.
AT THAT TIME, GOVERNMENT AND FMLN DELEGATIONS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT
COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO SEEK AN END TO HOSTILITIES WITHIN THE SPIRIT
OF THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN TELA,
HONDURAS.  BASED ON THE AGREEMENT REACHED IN MEXICO CITY, THE ISSUE TO
BE BROACHED DURING THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE,
COSTA RICA, ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER WOULD BE THE END TO HOSTILITIES BASED
ON PROPOSALS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN.  AT THAT TIME,
THE FMLN DID NOT ALLOW THE DISCUSSION OF THE TOPIC PREVIOUSLY AGREED
ON AND PRESENTED A SERIES OF PROPOSALS, DELIBERATELY COMPLEX IN FORM
AND CONTENT, WITH THE EVIDENT PURPOSE OF PREVENTING THE MAIN AND ONLY
TOPIC ON THE AGENDA FROM BEING DISCUSSED.

   ON 11 NOVEMBER, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AGAINST THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AN AGGRESSION THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY PLANNED AT LEAST A
FEW MONTHS BEFORE IT WAS LAUNCHED.  THIS PROVES THAT WHILE THE FMLN
WAS TALKING PEACE AND NEGOTIATIONS AROUND THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, IT
WAS, WITH THE POLITICAL, LOGISTICAL, AND MILITARY SUPPORT OF ORTEGA'S
GOVERNMENT, PREPARING THE CRIMINAL ATTACK AGAINST THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.

   SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION TO DATE, CERTAIN
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED THAT PROVE THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT
IN THE GENOCIDE IMPLEMENTED BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS. THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT HAS PROOF THAT THE FMLN IS A PUPPET OF DANIEL ORTEGA'S
DEADLY PLANS WHO, FACED WITH AN IMMINENT ELECTORAL DEFEAT AND IN
CONJUNCTION WITH FIDEL CASTRO, IS ATTEMPTING TO REGIONALIZE IN CENTRAL
AMERICA AN ARMED CONFLICT TO TRY TO SAVE THE SANDINIST REGIME.

   IN LIGHT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED AND HAVING ESTABLISHED THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT IN THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION
EXPERIENCED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
AGREED, ON 26 NOVEMBER 1989, TO SUSPEND DIPLOMATIC AND COMMERCIAL
RELATIONS WITH THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND RECALLED ITS DIPLOMATIC
MISSION FOR CONSULTATIONS.  IN LIGHT OF THESE SERIOUS ACTIONS WHICH
VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS PRESENTED
FORMAL CHARGES BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS SO THAT IMMEDIATE
AND EFFICIENT MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN TO REPUDIATE
 THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS AND SO THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WILL      
BE DIPLOMATICALLY AND POLITICALLY PRESSURED TO STOP THE AGGRESSION
IT HAS UNLEASHED AGAINST EL SALVADOR, AND THUS STOP A POSSIBLE           
CONFLICT OF UNPREDICTABLE DIMENSIONS.

   HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AT A TIME LIKE THIS, WHEN AROUND THE WORLD
MOMENTS OF POLITICAL FREEDOM ARE BEING EXPERIENCED IN PLACES LIKE
POLAND, THE GDR, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, AND HUNGARY, HERE, IN EL SALVADOR,
BECAUSE OF THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS -- WITH ORTEGA'S SUPPORT --
ATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE TO DROWN A NATION WHICH, DESPITE 10 YEARS OF
WAR, IS TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS?

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE ARE UNITED DURING THIS
HISTORIC TEST TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.


DEV-MUC3-0896 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] DEPUTY DEFENSE
MINISTER COLONEL JUAN ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAS SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES
STRUCTURE REMAINS INTACT AND THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF LAUNCHING ANOTHER
OFFENSIVE.  COL ZEPEDA SAID THAT THE COMMUNIST'S INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK
WAS LAUNCHED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND NOT AGAINST THE
MILITARY.  ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY CHIEF, THE TERRORISTS WERE TRYING
TO ENCOURAGE AN UPRISING AMONG THE PEOPLE; HOWEVER, THEY FAILED IN
THEIR ATTEMPT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND GAVE
THEIR SUPPORT TO THE ARMED FORCES.  COL ZEPEDA SAID THAT THE SUPPORT
OF THE PEOPLE FOR THE ARMED FORCES HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL AND VERY
IMPORTANT TO NEUTRALIZE THE FMLN'S COMMUNIST ATTACK.  THE DEPUTY
DEFENSE MINISTER SAID THAT THANKS TO THIS TOTAL SUPPORT, THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE A LOT OF WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION.  COL
ZEPEDA MENTIONED THE ALTOS DE LA CUEVA CASE IN SAN MIGUEL, WHERE
APPROXIMATELY A MILLION ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WERE FOUND.  ZEPEDA
CALLED ON THE PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR TRUST IN THE ARMED FORCES,
ADDING THAT THE ARMED FORCES' MORALE IS HIGH, VERY HIGH.


DEV-MUC3-0897 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION,
ATTENTION.  WE HAVE LAST MINUTE INFORMATION.

   ATTENTION.  FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] FORCES
HAVE BROKEN THE SIEGE THAT THE FASCIST TROOPS WERE MAINTAINING AROUND
NORTHWESTERN AND NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.

   ATTENTION.  WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING IN AREAS CLOSE TO THE ARMED
FORCES GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS.  WE REPEAT.  WE ARE FIGHTING IN
AREAS CLOSE TO THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS.  WE ARE
FIGHTING IN LA SULTANA NEIGHBORHOOD, ON THE SOUTHERN HIGHWAY AND
AROUND THE DEMOCRACIA BUILDING.

   OUR UNITS ENTERED THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE NEIGHBORHOOD INHABITED BY
HIGH-RANKING MILITARY CHIEFS AND OCCUPIED SEVERAL HOUSES THERE.  OUR
FORCES FOUND ARSENALS IN SOME OF THE HOUSES AND CLASHED AGAINST ENEMY
TROOPS.

   OUR FORCES SEIZED MANY WEAPONS INCLUDING RIFLES, MACHINEGUNS,
AMMUNITION, AND OTHER WAR MATERIAL.  ALL THOSE WEAPONS WERE FOUND IN
THE HOUSES OF SEVERAL HIGH-RANKING MILITARY CHIEFS IN THE MANUEL JOSE
ARCE NEIGHBORHOOD.

   WE ALSO HAVE REPORTS ON CLASHES IN THE AREA OF ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN
WHERE MILITARY DETACHMENT NO 6 REINFORCEMENTS REFUSED TO ADVANCE.  THE
SONSONATE TROOPS REFUSED TO ADVANCE TOWARD OUR POSITIONS IN THE AREA
OF ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN.

   SIMILARLY, OUR FORCES ARE HOLDING POSITIONS IN SOYAPANGO,
MEJICANOS, CUSCATANCINGO, AND AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  OUR FORCES ALSO HAVE
CONTROL OF THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY AND OTHER IMPORTANT ROUTES
LEADING TO SAN SALVADOR.

   THERE ARE CLASHES AGAINST BRACAMONTE BATTALION TROOPS IN LA SULTANA
NEIGHBORHOOD, SAN FRANCISCO, AND ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN.  THE ENEMY HAS
REACTED IN FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS.  THE ENEMY SENT BRACAMONTE BATTALION
REINFORCEMENTS IN ONE DIRECTION, BUT THEIR ADVANCE WAS NEUTRALIZED AND
HALTED AT THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD.  WE REPEAT.  THE FIRST HIGH
COMMAND RESPONSE TO OUR INCURSION INTO NORTHWESTERN AND WESTERN SAN
SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS INCLUDING BRACAMONTE BATTALION
REINFORCEMENTS HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED.  OUR FORCES AMBUSHED AND
NEUTRALIZED THOSE BRACAMONTE BATTALION REINFORCEMENTS.

   A SECOND ENEMY RESPONSE TO OUR INCURSION INTO AND CONTROL OF
NORTHWESTERN AND WESTERN SAN SALVADOR MOVED ALONG THE SOUTHERN HIGHWAY
AND WAS AMBUSHED WITH RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND THEREFORE
NEUTRALIZED.  THE ENEMY'S THIRD RESPONSE MOVING THROUGH SANTA TECLA
WAS ALSO ATTACKED BY OUR FORCES AND HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED WITH AN
AMBUSH NEAR LA UNIVERSAL AND GUADALUPE GARDENS.  THESE ATLACATL
BATTALION FORCES WERE ALSO NEUTRALIZED.

   WE ARE RECEIVING THIS REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR.  THE HIGH COMMAND'S
FIRST AND BELATED RESPONSE INCLUDED FOUR MOVEMENTS, WHICH WERE ALL
HALTED BY OUR FORCES.  THOSE FOUR HIGH COMMAND DEFENSIVE MOVEMENTS
HAVE BEEN ATTACKED AND NEUTRALIZED.  BOTH THE BRACAMONTE AND THE
ATLACATL BATTALIONS HAVE BEEN NEUTRALIZED.  MEANWHILE THE TROOPS
COMING FROM SONSONATE REFUSED TO ADVANCE IN SOUTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR.

   CLASHES NOW COVER A LARGE AREA FROM THE HIGHWAY LINKING SANTA
 TECLA AND SAN SALVADOR AND THROUGH LA MASCOTA, LAS PALMAS, SAN          
BENITO, MAQUILIGUE, CAMPESTRE, LOMAS VERDES, ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS,
CONTINUING TO THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO AND MOVING THROUGH THE ENTIRE     
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR INCLUDING AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CUSCATANCINGO,            
NORTHERN MEJICANOS, AND MEJICANOS ITSELF AND THEN MOVING TO CIUDAD
DELGADO, SOYAPANGO, AND THE SOUTHERN SECTION OF THE PAN-AMERICAN
HIGHWAY, WHERE OUR UNITS MAINTAIN POSITIONS AND ARE ADVANCING TOWARD
ENEMY FORCES.  IN OTHER WORDS, AT THIS HOUR THE FMLN HAS FORMED THE
LARGEST ARCH OF ATTACKS DURING OUR FORCES' ENTIRE OCCUPATION OF SAN
SALVADOR.                                                                


DEV-MUC3-0898 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE LEARNED
THAT THE GENERAL STAFF HAS ERECTED A HUMAN WALL, ERECTED BY COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE, FOLLOWING THE ARTILLERY ATTACK STAGED BY US AT 0515
THIS MORNING ON THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS.  IT WAS REPORTED THAT
HUNDREDS OF LITTLE SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN PLACED AS CANNON FODDER OUTSIDE
THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS.  THIS GIVES US NEW INTELLIGENCE DATA
ON THE MORALE OF COL PONCE, HOW THE CRISIS IS AFFECTING HIM.  WITHOUT
ANY MILITARY CRITERION, HE HAS PLACED A WALL OF SOLDIERS AROUND THE
GENERAL STAFF INSTALATIONS.  THIS IS A GOOD PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE
GIVEN TO US BY COL PONCE, CONCERNING HIS PHYSICAL STATE AND CONCERNING
THE UPSET BEING SUFFERED BY THE STRATEGIC ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF
COMMAND.

   WE CALL ON THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY CLUB, THE MAQUILIGUAS,
SAN BENITO, AND ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS TO IMMEDIATELY ABANDON THAT
COMBAT ZONE.  THE FIGHTING WILL GET WORSE AND THE AIR FORCE WILL BOMB
THE FMLN POSITIONS IN SAN BENITO AND ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS, THEREFORE
ITS INHABITANTS ARE URGED TO ABANDON THAT RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   A REPORT FROM USULUTAN INDICATES AT THIS TIME THAT THE FMLN UNITS
ARE ADVANCING AND FIGHTING IN THE SECTOR OF GAVIRIA, EL MANGUITO, AND
LOS PILOTOS NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY OF USULUTAN.  ALSO, IN THE AREA
OF SANTA ELENA THERE IS FIERCE FIGHTING.

   YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE.  WE HAVE ANOTHER REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS BEING RECEIVED FROM LOMAS VERDES.  IN THE
STRATEGIC ZONE OF LOMAS VERDES IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE
CAPITAL, AN ARMY ARMORED VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED AND ITS 50-CALIBER
MACHINEGUN WAS SEIZED, AS WELL AS MANY RIFLES AND MACHINEGUNS FROM THE
NATIONAL POLICE AND CAVALRY TROOPS.  YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS REPORT
FROM SAN SALVADOR.  FIGHTING IN THE EXCLUSIVE LOMAS VERDES
NEIGHBORHOOD INDICATES THAT AN ARMORED VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED.  DURING
THE FIGHTING A 50-CALIBER MACHINEGUN WAS SEIZED FROM THE DAMAGED
ARMORED VEHICLE.  IT IS BEING EMPLACED AND WILL BE USED AGAINST THE
AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS AND AIRCRAFT THAT ARE OVERFLYING THE AREA.

   SINCE 0000, WHEN THE FIGHTING BEGAN, TO 0940, WHEN WE RECEIVED THE
REPORT OF THE FIGHTING IN LOMAS VERDES NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE WESTERN
PART OF THE CAPITAL, NEAR ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, OUR FORCES HAVE
DESTROYED AN ARMORED VEHICLE AND SEIZED IN COMBAT TWO M-60
MACHINEGUNS, 8 M-16 RIFLES, 1 M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHER, THREE VRC
COMMUNICATION RADIOS, AND A 50-CALIBER MACHINEGUN SEIZED FROM THE
ARMORED VEHICLE.  THIS OCCURRED DURING THE FIGHTING WITH THE NATIONAL
POLICE AND CAVALRY TROOPS, WHICH SUSTAINED 14 CASUALTIES.

   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [EXCERPTS] WE
HAVE AN ACAN-EFE REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.  THE REPORT
READS: THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TODAY UNLEASHED A NEW OFFENSIVE IN
SAN SALVADOR WITH ATTACKS ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND FIERCE CLASHES
WITH THE ARMY IN SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH CONTINUE

   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
THE FIGHTING IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS BRINGS UP
SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM AND CONTENT OF THE WAR IN EL
SALVADOR WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE
POOR AND WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE
RICH.  TODAY, WHEN THE FIGHTING TOOK PLACE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE
CAPITAL CITY, INCLUDING PLACES SUCH AS THE ESCALON, SAN BENITO, SAN
FRANCISCO, AND GENERAL ARCE RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE U.S.  DIPLOMATIC
PERSONNEL LIVE, WHERE THE MILITARY OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
HAVE THEIR RESIDENCES, WHERE THE SALVADORAN HIGH SOCIETY HAS ITS
RESIDENCES, THEN THE REPERCUSSIONS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

   U.S. GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN REACTED QUICKLY AND WITHOUT DELAY.
MARLIN FITZWATER, JAMES BAKER, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AMBASSADOR
WALKER, EVERYONE WAS VERY WORRIED OVER THE FATE OF U.S. PERSONNEL.
THEY EXPRESSED ANGRY WORDS AGAINST THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE WORLD THAT IS
WELL INFORMED OF THE WAR SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, IT IS PRECISELY THE
PENTAGON, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE THEY
HAVE FINANCED AND GIVEN ADVICE TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY.

   IT IS NOT OUR PRESENCE IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS THAT
JEOPARDIZES U.S. PERSONNEL.  ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE U.S.
PRESENCE, THE U.S. MEDDLING IN EL SALVADOR THAT IS JEOPARDIZING ITS
STAFF.  THEY CANNOT ASK US TO GET OUT OF SAN SALVADOR SO THAT THE
AMERICANS WILL NOT BE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE.  IT IS THE U.S.
INTERVENTION IN THE COUNTRY THAT MUST COME TO AN END, SO THAT WE
SALVADORANS WILL BE ABLE TO SETTLE OUR PROBLEMS AMONG OURSELVES.  THIS
IS OUR LAND, OUR FATHERLAND.

   THE WAR WAS IMPOSED BY THE INJUSTICES, THE SLAUGHTERS, THE
DICTATORSHIPS, AND TO A GREAT EXTENT, BY THE AMERICANS WHO SPEND $1.4
MILLION DAILY IN THIS WAR.  THIS IS A CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR EL SALVADOR.
THAT IS WHY WE DEMAND THAT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, THAT IS, THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, THE U.S. CONGRESS, AND THE U.S. PEOPLE CAREFULLY THINK
THIS OVER AND ACT SENSIBLY SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT AN END TO
THIS WAR.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT -- THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION -- THINK THIS OVER AND PROMOTE CHANGES IN ITS POLICY
TOWARD EL SALVADOR, AND THUS MAKE FEASIBLE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.

   WE HAVE PUBLICLY AND OFFICIALLY SAID, AS ONE OF OUR MANY GESTURES
OF GOOD WILL, THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT ATTACK U.S. DIPLOMATIC
INSTALLATIONS OR PERSONNEL IN EL SALVADOR.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE
INSTRUCTED OUR UNITS, OUR FIGHTERS, AND COMMANDO GROUPS NOT TO ATTACK
DIPLOMATIC SITES, BECAUSE NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS FOR
THE FMLN.  WE HOPE THAT IN THE SAME MANNER, BOTH THE U.S. EMBASSY AS
WELL AS THE OTHER DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES WILL INSTRUCT THEIR
SECURITY GUARDS SO THEY WILL NOT BECOME INVOLVED IN THE FIGHTING, THUS
PREVENTING CONFUSION THAT WE WOULD ALL REGRET.

   THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN DEFINING THE
CONFLICT.  THE U.S. CONGRESS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,
SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS, ARE ALREADY DISCUSSING THE
TRUE SITUATION OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOMENT TO
CHANGE POLICIES.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTINUE TO FINANCE AND
SUPPORT A REGIME WHICH IS BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE         
CITIES, A REGIME WHICH MURDERS PRIESTS, WHICH PUBLICLY THREATENS THE     
BISHOPS.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST USE ITS GOOD JUDGMENT AND
CONTRIBUTE TO THE END OF THE WAR, AND NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A
FASCIST REGIME THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN OUR FATHERLAND, EL
SALVADOR.
