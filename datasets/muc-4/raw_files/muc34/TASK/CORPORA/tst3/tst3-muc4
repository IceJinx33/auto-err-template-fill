   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN
COMMANDER HANDAL BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [HANDAL]
WE ARE NOT DEMANDING THAT THEY STOP THEIR OPERATIONS AS A PRECONDITION
FOR NEGOTIATING.  HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE FACING THE
SAME SITUATION AS BEFORE, THEREFORE, WE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND WILL
CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS UNTIL A CEASE-FIRE IS AGREED.

   IN CARACAS WE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO NEGOTIATING AND HOLDING TALKS
IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A CEASE-FIRE AND THE NECESSARY AGREEMENTS FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE NATION.

   THAT IS THE IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW.  WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING
WITHOUT THAT GOAL, WITHOUT HAVING ANY COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE
ANYTHING.  HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SITUATION SHOULD
REMAIN THE SAME.  NOW THERE IS A NEW FACTOR, A COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE
AND REACH AGREEMENTS ON ALL THOSE TOPICS.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THE AGENDA, THAT THEY ARE
FULLY AWARE OF ALL THE TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED, AND THAT THEY KNOW THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE TIMETABLE AGREEMENT FOR DISCUSSIONS AND
NEGOTIATIONS.  YOU JOURNALISTS CAN HELP THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND PROBLEM.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] COMMANDER, WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE
FMLN TO JOIN THE PROCESS?

   [HANDAL] LOOK, DEADLINES ARE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT
NOW. WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW IS COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS TO REACH
POLITICAL AGREEMENTS.  THAT IS THE MAIN ASPECT OF THE GENEVA
AGREEMENT.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME DEADLINES WILL NOT BE MET. IF
DEADLINES ARE SET AND THE TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING THEM EXPIRES, THEN
THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO WASTING TIME.  THIS THEN LEADS TO STEPS BEING
DEMANDED THAT IN REALITY DEPEND ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT ARE
REACHED AND NOT THE DEADLINES FOR REACHING THEM.

   THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO THE AGENDA AND THE TIMETABLE AGREED TO HERE
IN CARACAS, THE ACCENT IS ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS.  THOSE
AGREEMENTS HAVE TO DO WITH CHANGES WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES.
EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE CHANGED.  EVERY FACTOR
CONCERNING THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE REVIEWED FROM A CERTAIN POINT OR
PERSPECTIVE.  CHANGES ARE NECESSARY; CHANGES MUST BE MADE AND THOSE
CHANGES MUST BE SIGNIFICANT. THESE CHANGES MUST COMPLETELY TRANSFORM
THE ARMED FORCES, BEGINNING WITH ITS ROLE AND INFLUENCE IN DETERMINING
THE COUNTRY'S POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.

   WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTING PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD FOR SOME TIME.
THE TOPIC OF DEMOCRATIZATION IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE TOPIC OF THE
ARMED FORCES, TO ITS PURGING, ITS REDUCTION, AND IN SUM, ITS END.  WE
BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT ALWAYS NEED THE ARMED FORCES.  AS
WITH ANY INSTITUTION OR HISTORICAL FACTOR, IT EMERGES, IT IS
MAINTAINED FOR A CERTAIN TIME, AND THEN IT TENDS TO DISAPPEAR.

   THE COUNTRY MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP. IT CANNOT
CONTINUE ALONG THE SAME PATH BECAUSE THIS WOULD ONLY REPRESENT
EXPENSES AND A HEAVY BURDEN FOR THE COUNTRY.

   FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE MEANT ABSENCE OF
LIBERTY, REAL SECURITY, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE CIVILIAN SOCIETY
TO DECIDE THE COUNTRY'S PATH.  ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A MERE
FORMALITY, WHERE THOSE WHO WERE NOT ELECTED RUN THE COUNTRY.

   THE COUNTRY IS NOW GOING THROUGH A DRAMA THAT HAS ALSO SHOCKED THE
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  EVERYONE IS
AWAITING THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOPING THAT THOSE WHO
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME WILL BE PUNISHED.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE
CASE OF JESUIT PRIESTS IS REALLY GRAVE; IT IS A DRAMA THAT REFLECTS
THE DRAMA OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HISTORY IN THE CURRENT CENTURY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THOSE ACCUSED OF THE ASSASSINATION OF
SIX JESUITS WILL HAVE A "FAIR TRIAL" AND IF FOUND GUILTY, WILL BE PUNISHED
WHETHER THEY ARE CIVILIANS, MILITARY, OR INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE, SUPREME COURT
PRESIDENT DR MAURICIO GUTIERREZ CASTRO SAID.

   THE TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED THAT SOME MILITARY
WERE REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THEIR
TWO MAIDS, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT DAYBREAK ON 16 NOVEMBER, AS REPORTED BY
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON 7 JANUARY.

   "THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN REST ASSURED THE SALVADORAN
JUDICIARY SYSTEM WILL NOT HESITATE TO ENFORCE THE LAW UPON THE AUTHORS OF
THIS HORRIBLE CRIME," DR GUTIERREZ POINTED OUT.

   GUTIERREZ SAID HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED OR THEIR
MILITARY RANKS, BECAUSE THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS
STILL CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND HAS NOT PRESENTED ITS REPORT TO THE
TRIBUNAL.

   HOWEVER, GENERAL PROSECUTOR DR MAURICIO EDUARDO COLORADO MAINTAINED
THAT THE MILITARY SUSPECTS "ARE REGROUPED AND HAVE BEEN PUT IN CUSTODY."
HOWEVER, HE DID NOT REVEAL THE NAMES OR THE MILITARY RANKS OF THE SUSPECTS.

   THE PROSECUTOR SAID THAT THE SCIENTIFIC TEST CONDUCTED BY THE
COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS AND THE SPECIALIZED POLICE
WORKING ON THIS CASE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE CRIME COULD HAVE BEEN
PERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS.

   "THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE WILL PROCEED ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND
AGAINST WHOEVER TURNS OUT TO BE GUILTY, BECAUSE IT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL
DUTY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE," COLORADO SAID.

   ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE, JUSTICE MINISTER DR OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA,
PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS SAID: "WE
UNDERSTAND THAT THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION ON THIS CASE WAS ANNOUNCED BY
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC A FEW DAYS AGO."  HE REFUSED TO MAKE ANY
FURTHER STATEMENTS.

   NEW UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] RECTOR JESUIT FRANCISCO ESTRADA
ADMITTED PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS TAKEN "A STEP FORWARD" BY
UNMASKING THE SUSPECTS IN THIS CRIME, "BECAUSE HIS ETHIC PRINCIPLES DO NOT
TOLERATE SUCH ATROCITIES."

   ESTRADA SAID HE UNDERSTANDS WHY CRISTIANI, DURING HIS 7 JANUARY SPEECH,
DID NOT GIVE ANY NAMES, "BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL BEING
CONDUCTED."  MOREOVER, THERE MUST NOT ONLY BE ONE SUSPECT, BUT RATHER
SEVERAL."

   BEFORE MEETING WITH THE REPORTERS, THE UCA RECTOR MET WITH OFFICIALS
FROM SCOTLAND YARD.  A FEW DAYS AGO, HE ALSO MET SPANISH, CANADIAN, AND
U.S.  POLICEMEN WHO, AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST, ARE ASSISTING THE
SALVADORAN COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF CLARIFYING THIS CASE.

ENRIQUE LOPEZ ALBUJAR TRINT, WHO WAS MURDERED IN A TERRORIST ATTACK
YESTERDAY.  THE POLICE ALSO STOPPED 8,000 CARS IN THE SEARCH FOR
ASSASSINS, WHO ARE PRESUMABLY MEMBERS OF THE MAOIST TERRORIST ORGANIZATION
SHINING PATH.

   LOPEZ ALBUJAR, WHO LEFT HIS POST AT THE MINISTRY IN MAY 1989, WAS
RIDDLED WITH BULLETS AS HE WAS GETTING OUT OF HIS CAR IN THE LIMA
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT OF SAN ISIDRO.  LOPEZ ALBUJAR, 63, WAS RETIRED.  HE
WAS DRIVING WITHOUT AN ESCORT.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES, THE CAR IN WHICH THE CRIMINALS FLED WAS

COMPOSITE MADE FROM WITNESS' REPORTS.  THE POLICE SAY THAT OLIVOS SILVA, A
FORESTRY ENGINEER, HAS PARTICIPATED IN OTHER ATTACKS AGAINST ARMED FORCES
PERSONNEL IN THE PAST.

   LOPEZ ALBUJAR'S MURDER HAS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION IN PERU.  ACCORDING
TO POLITICAL OBSERVERS, THE INCIDENT IS BEING REGARDED AS AN INDICATION
THAT THE SHINING PATH INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS TERRORIST ATTACKS TO
INTIMIDATE THE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE UPCOMING GENERAL ELECTION ON 8 APRIL.

   SOME 1600 PERUVIANS WERE MURDERED DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF 1989 DUE TO
THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE SURROUNDING THE 12 NOVEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.

ABOUT LA MARIA FARM, A LUXURIOUS RANCH LOCATED NEAR ASUBA, A FEW
KILOMETERS FROM BOGOTA.  AT 1900, A GOES [SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP] TEAM
SURROUNDED THE RANCH.  AN AGENT MAKES SURE THE MAIN GATE IS NOT
ELECTRICALLY WIRED, AND THE DECISION TO FORCIBLY ENTER THE HOUSE IS MADE.
THEY ALL COVER ONE ANOTHER AS THEY TAKE THEIR POSITIONS.  THESE MEN ARE
PERFECTLY TRAINED FOR THIS SORT OF WORK.  THESE IS A LIGHT INSIDE THE

   A PATROL ENTERS QUICKLY AND CONTROLS EVERY CORNER OF THE RANCH.  OTHER
UNIFORMED MEN SUPPORT THE OPERATION FROM OUTSIDE.  THEY UNSUCCESSFULLY LOOK
FOR CACHES.  THESE THREE WORKERS WHO WERE DOING REPAIRS AT THE RANCH WERE
DETAINED AS A PRECAUTION IN THE MAIN HALL.  MEANWHILE, THE SEARCH
CONTINUES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE HOUSE.  THREE SAFES WERE HIDDEN IN
DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE RANCH HOUSE.  ONE OF THE SAFES WAS BUILT INTO ONE

THE WORKERS' DISPOSAL.  NEAR THE MASTER BEDROOM WAS A LARGE SWIMMING POOL
WITH A GROUND-LEVEL WINDOW FROM THE SAUNA AND JACUZZI AREA.  THERE WERE
SEVERAL GAME ROOMS AND TENNIS AND SQUASH COURTS IN THE HOUSE.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 7 FEB 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH JUAN JOSE MEMBRENO, NICARAGUAN
EMBASSY COUNSELOR, BY RENATO ALVAREZ] [TEXT] [ALVAREZ] IN THE ABSENCE OF
NICARAGUAN AMBASSADOR FRANCISO LACAYO PARAJON, JUAN JOSE MEMBRENO,
COUNSELOR TO THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN HONDURAS, CHARACTERIZED AS
RIDICULOUS, STATEMENTS MADE YESTERDAY BY LUIS FRANCISCO ORDONEZ REYES,
WHO, ACCORDING TO POLICE, IS OF NICARAGUAN ORIGIN.  ORDONEZ REYES ACCUSED
JOSE JESUS PENA--ALLEGED CHIEF OF SECURITY FOR THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN
TEGUCIGALPA--OF MASTERMINDING THE 7 JANUARY ASSASSINATION OF CONTRA
COMMANDER MANUEL ANTONIO RUGAMA.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MEMBRENO] WE CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT ALLEGATION.
THESE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE EMBASSY ARE RIDICULOUS.  THE EMBASSY HAS NO
OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE WITH THE NAME OF THE MAN IDENTIFIED IN THE NEWS
CONFERENCE.  THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MANY ACCOUNTS OF THIS INCIDENT THAT
POINT TO THE COUNTERREVOLUTION.  WE CATEGORICALLY DENY THESE ACCUSATIONS
AND CHARACTERIZE THEM AS RIDICULOUS.  WE HAVE NO SECURITY OFFICERS AT THIS
EMBASSY, ONLY DIPLOMATIC AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL. [END RECORDING]

   [ALVAREZ] ALL THE PERSONNEL WHO WORK AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN
TEGUCIGALPA ARE APPOINTED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, ACCORDING TO THE
COUNSELOR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MEMBRENO] ALL OUR PERSONNEL ARE NICARAGUANS.  IN
REGARD TO WHAT HE [ORDONEZ REYES] HAS INVENTED, WE THINK IT IS
RIDICULOUS.  WE ONLY HAVE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL WORKING AT THE
EMBASSY. [END RECORDING]

   [ALVAREZ] REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY AGENTS
INFILTRATED THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA, COUNSELOR JUAN JOSE
MEMBRENO REPLIED:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MEMBRENO] THIS HAPPENED AT THE AMBASSADOR'S
RESIDENCE.  THE AMBASSADOR LEARNED BY CHANCE THAT ONE OF THE RESIDENCE
GUARDS WAS OF NICARAGUAN ORIGIN WITH ALLEDGED COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY LINKS.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.  THIS CASE DID NOT OCCUR AT THE EMBASSY.

   [ALVAREZ] IS MANAGUA INTERESTED IN ELIMINATING ALL THE CONTRA LEADERS
LIVING IN HONDURAS OR ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE LINKED TO THE COUNTERREVOLUTION?

   [MEMBRENO] ON THE CONTRARY, WE RESPECT PEOPLES' LIVES AND THAT IS WHY WE
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO RECEIVE IN NICARAGUA ALL NICARAGUANS WHO WANT
TO ACCEPT AMNESTY AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE IN ONE WAY OR OTHER BEEN INVOLVED
IN THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY CAMPAIGN.

   [ALVAREZ] HAVE THERE BEEN ANY MORE ATTACKS AGAINST THIS EMBASSY OR ANY
OTHER TYPE OF THREAT, AS OCCURRED A FEW DAYS AGO?

   [MEMBRENO] NO, AFTER THE SHOOTING INCIDENT AT THE AMBASSADOR'S
RESIDENCE, WHAT HAPPENED A FEW DAYS LATER--HERE AT THE EMBASSY--WAS THAT A
CAR DROVE PAST THE EMBASSY AT NIGHT AND KNOCKED DOWN SOME SECURITY RAILS
ON THE SIDEWALK. [END RECORDING]

CONDEMNS THE TERRORIST ATTACKS CARRIED OUT WITH EXPLOSIVES TODAY AGAINST
THE COMMITTEE OF MOTHERS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND MISSING IN EL SALVADOR
AND AGAINST THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION.  AS A RESULT
OF THESE ATTACKS, SEVERAL PERSONS WERE WOUNDED AND OTHERS DIED.  THE
GOVERNMENT OFFERS ITS CONDOLENCES.

   THE GOVERNMENT REPUDIATES THESE IRRATIONAL AND CRIMINAL ACTIONS AND THE
TERRORIST ATTACK CARRIED OUT ON 30 OCTOBER BY THE FMLN AGAINST THE ARMED
FORCES STAFF INSTALLATIONS, WHERE 1 CIVILIAN DIED AND 14 OTHERS WERE
WOUNDED.  IT IS EVIDENT THAT THESE ACTIONS ARE PART OF A PLOT WHOSE
OBJECTIVE IS TO BLOCK THE DIALOGUE INITIATED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI.

   THE GOVERNMENT HAS ORDERED A CAREFUL INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHAT
HAPPENED AND TO FILE CHARGES AGAINST CRIMINAL GROUPS THAT HAVE UNLEASHED
THIS INCREASED WAVE OF TERRORIST VIOLENCE TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF UNREST AND
TO BLOCK THE ROAD TO PEACE.

   FINALLY, THE GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR REAFFIRMS ITS DETERMINATION TO
CONTINUE THE SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH THE DIALOGUE, AND IT STATES THAT IN
SPITE OF THESE BLOODY EVENTS, SALVADORANS MUST REMAIN CALM AND NOT GIVE UP
HOPES TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH CIVILIZED MEANS.

ESPECIALLY THE PARTICIPATION OF FOREIGN COMPANIES, IS REPORTEDLY THE
AIM OF THE PUBLICITY STUNT CARRIED OUT BY THE PRO-CASTRO ELN [ARMY OF
NATIONAL LIBERATION], WHICH KIDNAPPED SEVERAL HONORARY CONSULS,
NEWSMEN, AND POLITICAL LEADERS.

   ANONYMOUS SOURCES OF THE LEFTIST GROUP HEADED BY SPANISH PRIEST

IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS MEMBERS OF THE MANUEL GUSTAVO CHACON
SOVEREIGNTY OPERATION, WHICH WAS NAMED IN HONOR OF THE LEADER OF THE
POWERFUL [NAME INDISTINCT] LABOR UNION OF ECOPETROL [COLOMBIAN
PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE], MURDERED IN BARRANCABERMEJA IN FEBRUARY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 89 -- [TEXT] THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND SAID AT
THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY THAT IT DOES NOT AGREE WITH VIOLATING THE
CONSTITUTION TO FAVOR THE FMLN PROPOSAL.  THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY MET
THIS MORNING WITH PRESIDENT DUARTE, AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED
FORCES; DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL CARLOS EUGENIO VIDES CASANOVA; AND ARMED
FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE.

   THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND TRUSTS THE POLITICAL PARTIES' MATURITY AND
WILL SUPPORT ANY RESOLUTION THEY APPROVE CONCERNING THE FMLN PROPOSAL, THE
DEFENSE MINISTER SAID FOLLOWING A PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY'S DIRECTORATE BOARD AND POLITICAL COMMISSION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GEN VIDES] I TOLD THE POLITICAL PARTIES: IF YOU
WANT TO GIVE THEM ADVANTAGES SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR
CANDIDATES TO WIN, GO AHEAD AND DO IT.  THEY MUST DECIDE WHETHER THEY
WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE ADVANTAGES OR NOT; BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE
UNJUST.  A DEATH SQUAD MIGHT SAY: WE DO NOT WANT PEACE AND WE WILL SET
OFF BOMBS UNTIL THE OTHERS CHANGE THEIR MINDS.

   THIS IS NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW.  WE WOULD BE SIMPLY ESTABLISHING A
PRECEDENT.  THAT IS THE MAIN DANGER.  IF THE CONSTITUTION IS CHANGED AT
WILL TODAY THEN IT CAN BE CHANGED AGAIN TOMORROW, AND AGAIN UNTIL THINGS
ARE JUST AS THE REBELS WANT THEM. [END RECORDING]

   THE MEETING WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY NAPOLEON DUARTE, IN HIS ROLE AS
COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] I AM HERE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE
ARMED FORCES.  I FULLY SUPPORT THE ARMED FORCES' DECISION CONCERNING
ITS UNITY AND THE NEED TO [WORDS INDISTINCT] CONSTITUTION, AND THE
WARNING THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL NOT ADOPT POSITIONS TO HINDER THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN TOO MUCH
BLOODSHED AND TOO MANY LIVES LOST ALREADY. [END RECORDING]

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE FMLN PROPOSAL WAS THOROUGHLY ANALYZED DURING
THE MEETING, AND IT WAS AGREED THAT THE CONSTITUTION CANNOT BE VIOLATED TO
FAVOR MINORITY GROUPS' POSITIONS.

   THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADDED:  THE ARMED FORCES ARE STRONGER THAN EVER.
HE ALSO REFERRED TO THE U.S. VICE PRESIDENT'S VISIT AND SAID THAT HIS VIEWS
COINCIDE WITH THE ARMED FORCES' GOALS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING HUMAN
RIGHTS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND'S VISIT TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS
CONSIDERED THE SECOND STEP TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL TO THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.  THE FIRST STEP WAS TO CALL A MEETING OF THE THE
POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH WAS NOT ATTENDED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY
BUT SERVED AS THE BASIS FOR FUTURE MEETINGS IN A SO-CALLED NEUTRAL PLACE.

   THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY'S POLITICAL COMMISSION HAS NOT RULED OUT THE
POSSIBILITY OF INVITING ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, WHO IS INVOLVED
TO SOME DEGREE IN THE REBEL PROPOSAL.

   CLANDESTINE, 2 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] THE
FMLN REPORTS TO OUR PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE MASSACRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION
FEDERATION [FENASTRAS] WAS PLANNED IN COLD BLOOD.  THE SITE AND THE
MOMENT WHEN THE FENASTRAS LEADERS WERE MEETING HAD BEEN SELECTED.

   2.  WE HAVE TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION FROM OUR INTELLIGENCE ORGANS THAT
THIS ACTION WAS ORDERED BY COLONEL PONCE, THAT CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT AND
APPROVED IT, AND THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTE AS THE
HEAD OF THE MORBID DEATH SQUAD OF THE ARMY'S 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IN
RESPONSE TO OUR MILITARY ATTACK ON THE ARMY STAFF.  THIS BEHAVIOR BY
CRISTIANI SHOULD SURPRISE NO ONE.  TERRORISM IS AN OLD PRACTICE OF THE
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA].

   ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, ARENA ASSASSINS TRIED TO KILL THE PRESIDENT OF THE
MORTGAGE BANK, MR MASON, FOR NOT FOLLOWING THEIR ORDERS.

   3.  THE PEOPLE DEMAND THE RESIGNATION OF CHIEF OF STAFF COL EMILIO PONCE
BECAUSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS CRIMINAL ACTION IS REAL.

   4.  THE FMLN HAS PRUDENTLY TAKEN TIME BEFORE ADOPTING A DEFINITE
POSITION.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADOPTED AN
IRRESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE AND HAVE BRAZENLY ACCUSED THE FMLN OF THE CRIMES
THEY COMMIT.

   IN VIEW OF THIS ATTITUDE AND OF THE PEOPLE'S INDIGNATION, WE HAVE TO
PREVENT OUR PRESENCE AT THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO COVER UP THE
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS MASSACRE AND TO ENHANCE THE MASK OF
MODERATOR AND NEGOTIATOR THAT CRISTIANI HAS BEEN USING TO SECURE POLITICAL
SUPPORT AND U.S. FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO EXTEND THE WAR.

   IN SAN JOSE, SPEAKING ON ITS VIEW OF THE WAR, THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT
IT CONSIDERS POPULAR MOVEMENTS AS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FMLN, AND
THEREFORE, AS ENEMIES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE ARMED CONFLICT.

   WE DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION GIVE US A LIST OF THOSE
ORGANIZATIONS, BUT TO NO AVAIL.  THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND MASSACRES ARE
NOW YIELDING THE LISTS THAT WERE DENIED TO US AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE.

   EVEN BEFORE THE SAN JOSE MEETING, THE GOVERNMENT HAD GREATLY INCREASED
ITS REPRESSION.  SINCE THE MEETING, IT HAS INCREASED ITS DETENTIONS AND
ATTACKED THE RESIDENCES OF LEADERS OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S
MOVEMENT AND THE UDN [NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION], UNIVERSITY, FECMASAN
[MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND
RELATIVES], AND FENASTRAS.  MEANWHILE, CRISTIANI IS MAINTAINING HIS
HYPOCRITICAL POSITION OF MODERATION.

   THE MASSACRES, DETENTIONS, AND REPRESSION OF EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS, THE
REPATRIATED, UNIVERSITIES, LABOR UNIONS, PEASANT COOPERATIVES, MOTHERS'
ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION SHOW THAT THE WAR OF
THE ARMED FORCES, GOVERNMENT, AND ARENA IS AIMED AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND,
THEREFORE, THESE GROUPS CANNOT AND WILL NOT REMAIN IDLE.

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE UP ARMS AND EXERCISE THEIR
LEGITIMATE DEFENSE.  THE ARMED PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE HEADED
BY THE FMLN IS JUST, LEGITIMATE, AND NECESSARY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT]
TWO-FACED CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, THE FMLN HAS DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY
CONTACT THE DIALOGUE OBSERVERS AND THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE MEDIATOR, TO
DEMAND THROUGH THEM GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION CIVIC AND LABOR GROUPS AND A
REVIEW OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF THE DIALOGUE, NEGOTIATION PROCESS, AND
ITS PROSPECTS.  MEANWHILE, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUSPEND OUR
PARTICIPATION IN THE CARACAS MEETING.

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 APR 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] URBAN COMMANDOS HAVE DENIED
REPORTS THEY PARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT
FRANCISCO MERINO'S HOME.

   AT 0530 THIS MORNING, UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS PLACED THREE EXPLOSIVE
DEVICES AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF MERINO'S HOME IN THE MACHILIGUAS
NEIGHBORHOOD.  TWO OF THE DEVICES EXPLODED.  

   REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE PERPETRATORS, WHO ARRIVED IN A VEHICLE, ALSO
FIRED AT THE GUARDS PROTECTING MERINO'S RESIDENCE.  EARLY REPORTS POINTED TO
URBAN COMMANDOS AS THE PRESUMED PERPETRATORS, BUT A SPOKESMAN FOR THE
MODESTO RAMIREZ CENTRAL FRONT, IN A TELEPHONE CALL, DENIED THE REPORT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED FMLN SPOKESMAN] ON THIS OCCASION, THE FMLN
MUST EXPLAIN THAT OUR FORCES DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE ATTACK IN QUESTION.
THE FMLN WARNS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
TO CREATE CONFUSION AND PROMOTE TRUE STATE TERRORISM.

   THE FMLN CONDEMNS THE [WORD INDISTINCT] AGAINST OUR PEOPLE AND WARNS THAT
THESE ACTIONS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE
RESPONSE.  THE FMLN CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTIONS IN WHICH IT IS
DIRECTLY INVOLVED.  IN THIS CASE, WE WERE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED.  THE FMLN
WARNS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS SITUATION TO
PERPETRATE ATTACKS ON INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS WHICH CAN BE EASILY
ATTRIBUTED TO THE FMLN. [END RECORDING]

   THE FMLN DESCRIBED STATEMENTS MADE BY PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI
AS IRRESPONSIBLE.  THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IMMEDIATELY CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND
ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE URBAN COMMANDOS.  AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK, A
15-YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS WOUNDED AND CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE WAS REPORTED.  MERINO
IS CURRENTLY OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE GARRISON AND THE NATIONAL
POLICE STATION IN SAN SALVADOR'S SACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD TONIGHT.

   ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, AT LEAST SIX FMLN GUERRILLAS WERE
KILLED DURING THE ATTACK.  THREE POLICEMEN, A SOLDIER OF THE 1ST INFANTRY
BRIGADE, AND FOUR CIVILIANS WERE WOUNDED AND TAKEN BY THE RED CROSS TO THE
LOCAL HOSPITAL.

   URBAN GUERRILLAS BEGAN THE ATTACK AT 1805.  THEY STRUCK BOTH THE 1ST
INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE NATIONAL POLICE STATION IN THE SACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED MILITARY OFFICER] THE GUERRILLAS USED
60-MM MORTARS AND RPG-18 ROCKET LAUNCHERS.  THE TERRORISTS TRAVELED IN
CARS.  THEY DESTROYED SEVERAL POWER POLES ON 29TH STREET AND MACHINEGUNNED
SEVERAL TRANSFORMERS.  THE ATTACK CAME MAINLY FROM THE SOUTH, WHERE THE
COHACHE ORGANIZATION IS LOCATED, AND FROM THE HONDUA CHURCH HERE.  THEY
ALSO ATTACKED FROM THE NORTHEAST, BUT MOST OF THE ATTACKERS CAME FROM THE
DIRECTION OF THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, FIRING FROM THERE AT SOME [WORD
INDISTINCT] WE HAVE IN THE AREA.  WE HAD REMOVED THE CORDON AROUND THE
UNIVERSITY 4 OR 5 DAYS AGO, AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] FIRED FROM THERE.

   THE WOUNDED INCLUDE AT LEAST THREE CIVILIANS, ONE OF WHOM IS IN SERIOUS
CONDITION AND HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN BY OUR TROOPS TO THE MILITARY HOSPITAL;
PERHAPS FIVE TRAFFIC POLICEMEN, ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED; AND A
SOLDIER OF THE BELLOSO BATTALION.

   NO DAMAGE WAS CAUSED HERE AT THE GARRISON.  ONLY A FEW SHELLS HIT THE
GARRISON, AND THESE WERE 60-MM MORTAR SHELLS, WHICH ARE NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO CAUSE DAMAGE.  WE FOUND SIX [WORDS INDISTINCT].  AS FOR THE RPG'S, WE
FOUND ONLY ONE [WORDS INDISTINCT] BEHIND THE ANTEL [NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION
FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS] OFFICE [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE FOUND SIX HOLES
FROM M-79 SHELLS, BUT THEY DID NOT CAUSE GREAT DAMAGE.

   ONE OF OUR CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES CAME OUT SLIGHTLY WOUNDED FROM THE [WORD
INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, OUR COUNTRY WILL HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT IN A FEW DAYS.
THE FMLN HAS CALLED A NEW TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE BEGINNING ON 31 MAY AND
HAS NOW ATTACKED THE 1ST BRIGADE.  BASED ON THIS EVIDENCE, DO YOU FEEL THE
FMLN WILL INTENSIFY ITS MILITARY ACTIONS IN SAN SALVADOR?  

   [MILITARY OFFICER] OF COURSE, WE ARE EXPECTING THIS.  CHANNEL 12 HAS
ALREADY REPORTED THAT A TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE WILL BEGIN ON 31 MAY.
THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE VIGILANCE MUST BE INCREASED.  WE EXPECTED THIS KIND OF
ATTACK.  WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID WE ARE PREPARED TO REPEL ANY TERRORIST ATTACK,
AND THIS WAS A TYPICAL TERRORIST ATTACK.  FROM A MILITARY STANDPOINT, I DO
NOT THINK THE ATTACK WAS VERY EFFECTIVE.  THE GUERRILLAS USED MORTARS BUT
MOSTLY HURT CIVILIANS. [END RECORDING]

OF TWO YOUNG U.S. CITIZENS ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY A SPECIALIZED GROUP
[NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] SUMMONED SPECIALLY TO CLARIFY THIS CRIME.

   COLONEL ARMANDO SANTAGORDA, IN A STATEMENT TO PANAMERICANA, SAID THAT
HIS GROUP IS SUPPORTED BY THE CHIEF OF POLICE, WHO HAS GIVEN PRECISE
INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL POLICEMEN TO COOPERATE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   MOREOVER, HE SAID THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ARRIVAL IN THE PAST FEW
HOURS OF SPECIALIZED U.S. POLICEMEN, ALLEGEDLY HERE TO COOPERATE IN THE
INVESTIGATIONS THAT, SO FAR, ARE UNDER THE COMMAND AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE
BOLIVIAN POLICE FORCES.  

   HOWEVER, SANTAGORDA ASSERTED THAT THE INSTITUTION, IN COMPLIANCE WITH
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, IS IN PERMANENT CONTACT WITH POLICE FORCES OF
OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH INTERPOL.

   HE SAID THAT REGARDING THE CASE OF THE MURDERED U.S.  CITIZENS, THE
POLICE ARE ALSO EXCHANGING INFORMATION BECAUSE THE INCIDENT IS OF AN
INTERNATIONAL NATURE. HE SAID THAT HE BASED HIS DECLARATIONS ON THE
PRELIMINARY INFORMATION OBTAINED SHORTLY AFTER THE CRIME.

   SANTAGORDA SAID THAT FOUR PERUVIANS SUSPECTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING
INVESTIGATED, AND THEY WILL HAVE TO JUSTIFY THEIR PRESENCE IN BOLIVIA.

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 JUN 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT AND INTERIOR MINISTER FRANCISCO MERINO BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT AND INTERIOR
MINISTER FRANCISCO MERINO REFERRED TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] DOCUMENT ISSUED HOURS AGO, WHICH DENIED ANY
RESPONSIBILITY IN DR JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] HAS BEEN ACTING ERRATICALLY FOR SOME TIME; ALL ITS ACTIONS ARE QUITE
ERRATIC.  THE FMLN PLANS THAT THE ARMED FORCES RECENTLY SEIZED INCLUDE A
STRATEGY IN WHICH THE FMLN IS TO CREATE CONFUSION AMONG THE POPULATION BY
NOT CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF ACTIONS AND CRIMES.  UNDER
THESE GUIDELINES, THE FMLN HAS NOT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACTIONS,
TO INSINUATE...[CHANGES THOUGHT] TO CREATE CONFUSION OR GIVE THE
IMPRESSION THIS IS A VIOLENT SITUATION THAT HAS ARISEN BETWEEN POLITICAL
GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY.

   FORTUNATELY THERE IS EVIDENCE.  THE ARMED FORCES HAVE THE DOCUMENTS THAT
PROVE THAT THIS IS A STRATEGY CARRIED OUT BY TERRORIST GROUPS TO PERPETRATE
THIS KIND OF ACTION AND PROVOKE A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND
DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN THE COUNTRY.

   OTHER VALUABLE INFORMATION HAS BEEN UNCOVERED, BUT I BELIEVE IT IS MORE
APPROPRIATE FOR THE PUBLIC SECURITY AUTHORITIES TO REVEAL THIS. TERRORISTS
HAVE RECENTLY ISSUED DECLARATIONS REVEALING THIS STRATEGY, THEIR MODUS
OPERANDI, AND THE PLANS THEY HAVE FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. THEY HAVE PLANS TO
CONTINUE DEALING BLOWS AGAINST THE NEW ADMINISTRATION THROUGH ITS OFFICIALS
TO FORCE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE -- AS THEY DID WITH
FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT. [END RECORDING]

   VICE PRESIDENT MERINO ALSO REFERRED TO ANOTHER TOPIC IN THE NEWS, THE
ANTITERRORIST LAW:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WE UNDERSTAND THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN SENT TO
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  THERE IS [WORDS INDISTINCT] FOR THE DEFENSE OF
DEMOCRACY, AND ANOTHER ONE THAT REFERS TO THE ANTITERRORIST LAW.  THE TRUTH
IS THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS BEEN QUITE CLEAR IN ITS POSITION, WHICH WAS
STATED BY THE VICE PRESIDENCY.

   THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS CLEARLY STATED IT CANNOT LET THESE PEOPLE
CONTINUE OPERATING WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS OR CONTROLS, VIOLATING THE LAW,
DISRUPTING SOCIAL LIFE, AND DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE MUST BE PROTECTED BY EFFECTIVE LAWS SO THE PUBLIC
SECURITY FORCES CAN CONTROL THE SITUATION AND SO THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE NOT
INTERPRETED AS AN ABUSE OF AUTHORITY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] PENAL CODE THAT
CONTEMPLATES ALL THE SENTENCES FOR TERRORIST CRIMES; HOWEVER, THEY HAVE
PROVED INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE THEY MAY LACK THE PROCEDURES NEEDED IN OUR
CURRENT SITUATION. THOSE LAWS DATE BACK MANY DECADES; IT WAS NEVER FORESEEN
THAT EL SALVADOR COULD REACH THE CURRENT DETERIORATED SITUATION, IN WHICH
PEOPLE ARE KILLED AND THE CULPRITS CALMLY WALK AWAY.  NEWSPAPERS [WORDS
INDISTINCT] SAY THAT SINCE WE ARE AT WAR, IT IS EASY FOR THEM TO KILL.  

   [REPORTER] IT IS RUMORED THAT THE LAW [PASSAGE INDISTINCT].  

   [MERINO] THE PROVISIONS ALREADY EXIST; ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS HARMONIZE
THEM.  WE MUST FULFILL OUR OBLIGATION.  THE CONSTITUTION [WORDS
INDISTINCT] STATED THAT EVERY SECONDARY LAW SHOULD BE HARMONIZED WITH THE
CONSTITUTION.  IN THIS CASE, THE PENAL CODE, THE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN
NEGLECTED TO A CERTAIN POINT, AND IT IS IMPERATIVE -- IF WE ARE GOING TO
ABIDE BY THE CONSTITUTION -- TO ADAPT THEM TO OUR SITUATION.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NO OFFICIAL OF A FRIENDLY COUNTRY CAN
INTERFERE WITH THIS.

   I RECENTLY TOLD SOME JOURNALISTS WHO ARE MY FRIENDS THAT VICE PRESIDENT
QUAYLE'S GOAL WAS TO COME AND REAFFIRM HIS GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF THE NEW
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  HE DID IT ON THIS DATE BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE HE WAS IN
CHARGE OF THE U.S. PRESIDENCY WHILE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS IN EUROPE.  HIS VISIT
TO EL SALVADOR WAS NOT A MERE COINCIDENCE.  HE CAME TO REAFFIRM THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. [END RECORDING]

   MOSCOW (USSR), 12 JUL 89 (PRAVDA) -- [STATEMENT] [SOVIET COMMITTEE
FOR SOLIDARITY WITH LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES] [TEXT] BLOOD IS FLOWING IN
COLUMBIA, MORE ABUNDANTLY EVERY YEAR.  LAST YEAR, ACCORDING TO
OFFICIAL STATISTICS, THERE WERE 4,600 VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE.
ABOUT HALF OF THOSE KILLED WERE PEASANTS.  AN "INTERNAL WAR,"
UNLEASHED BY THE OLIGARCHY MANY YEARS AGO, IS BEING WAGED AGAINST
THEM.  THE ACTIVISTS OF THE COALITION OF LEFT-WING PARTIES AND
ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMUNISTS -- THE
PATRIOTIC UNION -- COME NEXT, AFTER THE PEASANTS.  THE PEOPLE KILLED
INCLUDE JAIME PARDO LEAL, PRESIDENT OF ITS NATIONAL COORDINATION
COMMITTEE, AROUND 30 DEPUTIES, AND MANY MUNICIPAL ADVISORS AND MAYORS.

   THE ORGANIZERS OF THE "DIRTY WAR" AND THE LEADERS OF THE "DEATH SQUADS,"
AND OTHER ULTRA-RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS AND THEIR HIRED KILLERS, FEEL THAT
THEY CAN GO UNPUNISHED.  THE RESPONSE TO THE TERROR OF THE RIGHT HAS THE
ARMED STRUGGLE WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM.

   IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, VICTIMS OF POLITICAL TERROR ALSO INCLUDED
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RULING CIRCLES AND THEIR LAW-ENFORCEMENT ORGANS,
WAGING AN UNEQUAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE POWERFUL NARCOTICS MAFIA.  AS A
"SHADOW ECONOMY," IT IS TRYING TO BECOME PART OF THE STATE STRUCTURE.  IN
THE PAST YEAR THE NARCOTICS BUSINESS HAS "ENRICHED" THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY
WITH $2 BILLION AND EVEN PROPOSED THAT IT WOULD PAY OFF THE GIGANTIC FOREIGN
DEBT.  THE NARCOTICS MAFIA CARRIES OUT REPRISALS AGAINST ITS OPPONENTS.  THE
MINISTER OF JUSTICE, A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT, A DIRECTOR OF THE BIGGEST
NEWSPAPER ESPECTADOR, AND, A FEW DAYS AGO, ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, GOVERNOR
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTIOQUIA WERE KILLED.  MANY PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES ARE
LEAVING THE COUNTRY THROUGH FEAR FOR THEIR OWN LIVES AND THOSE OF THEIR
RELATIVES.

   THE VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING AND THE IMPRESSION IS BEING FORMED THAT
CERTAIN FORCES ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE ATTENTION OF THE 30 MILLION STRONG
POPULATION OF COLOMBIA AWAY FROM THE URGENT RESOLUTION OF PRESSING SOCIAL
PROBLEMS BY DESTABILIZING INTERNAL LIFE.

   SOVIET SOCIETY, IN THE NAME OF OBSERVING BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND CHARITY,
CONSIDERS THAT OUR CONSCIENCE CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH THE ORGY OF
POLITICAL TERROR OVERWHELMING COLOMBIA.  WE APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC OF THE
WORLD TO RAISE THEIR VOICES AGAINST THIS EVIL IN THE NAME OF THE COMMON
SOLIDARITY OF MANKIND.  DRASTIC ACTIONS ARE NEEDED PARTICULARLY ON BEHALF OF
INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS.

   WE CONSIDER THAT IN COLOMBIA ITSELF, DIALOGUE BETWEEN OPPOSING SIDES THAT
ARE TAKING THE STAND OF PATRIOTISM AND POLITICAL REALISM IS NECESSARY.  THE
FRUITFULNESS OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE HAS BEEN PROVED IN PRACTICE IN THE PAST
FEW YEARS BY MANY COUNTRIES. THE VITAL INTERESTS OF THE TORMENTED COLOMBIAN
PEOPLE CALL FOR CIVIL PEACE.

   BOGOTA, 14 JUL 89 (EMISORAS CARACOL NETWORK) -- [TEXT] FOR THE

[COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE] WORKERS ARE REPAIRING THE CANO
LIMON-COVENAS PIPELINE AND CLEANING UP THE ARAUCA RIVER ALONG THE
VENEZUELAN BORDER, WHERE A HUGE OIL SPILL WAS CAUSED BY ANOTHER ATTACK
AGAINST THE OIL PIPELINE.

   AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS A POWERFUL DYNAMITE EXPLOSION AT THE
VINA-PUERTO SALGAR OIL PIPELINE, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30 KM FROM NATAGAIMA,
IN NORTHERN HUILA DEPARTMENT, CAUSING AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF CRUDE OIL TO
SPILL.

   THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN LESS THAN 1 MONTH THAT TERRORISTS HAVE
ATTACKED THE OIL PIPELINE OPERATED BY HOUSTON OIL AND ECOPETROL.  A FEW
WEEKS AGO, TERRORISTS DESTROYED THE PIPELINE NEAR AIPE, WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER
OIL SPILL.

   MEANWHILE, OPERATORS FROM THE STATE-RUN OIL COMPANY YESTERDAY BEGAN
REPAIRING THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE DYNAMITED ON THE NIGHT OF 12
JULY IN ARAUQUITA JURISDICTION, WHICH FORCED THE SUSPENSION OF OIL PUMPING

THE 7 JULY ATTACK AGAINST THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE.  THAT
ATTACK RESULTED IN A SPILL OF 13,000 BARRELS OF OIL, WHICH SEVERELY
CONTAMINATED FARMING AREAS AND THE ARAUCA RIVER, TO THE POINT THAT THE
POTABLE WATER SERVICE WAS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED IN ARAUCA'S CAPITAL CITY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 JUL 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] SAN SALVADOR
DOMESTIC SERVICE IN SPANISH AT 0202 GMT ON 21 JULY BROADCASTS A 1 HOUR
AND 11 MINUTE LIVE OR RECORDED SPEECH "TO THE NATION" BY SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON "THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY
AND THE NATIONAL RECOVERY PLAN."  NO DATE OR PLACE IS GIVEN.

   CRISTIANI BEGINS BY SAYING THAT THIS IS HIS FIRST REPORT TO THE NATION
AFTER 50 DAYS AS PRESIDENT.  HE NOTES THAT SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ON 1 JUNE,
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS INCREASED ITS LEVEL OF
VIOLENCE AND ITS NUMBER OF "INDISCRIMINATE KILLINGS."  HE SAYS THAT THERE IS
NO REASON FOR THIS SINCE HE EXPRESSED ON 1 JUNE HIS DESIRE FIND A PEACEFUL
SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.

   CRISTIANI SAYS THAT SINCE 1 JUNE HE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR A PEACE
DIALOGUE, ADDING:  "IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE OF THIS NATURE, IT MUST BE
HELD IN TWO PHASES:  NATURALLY, DURING THE FIRST PHASE BOTH SIDES MUST SIT
DOWN TO DISCUSS THE MECHANISMS TO DEVELOP THAT DIALOGUE PROCESS, A TIMETABLE
FOR THE TALKS, AND THE PLACE WHERE THE TALKS WILL BE HELD.  IN OTHER WORDS,
THE FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL TAKE
PLACE.  THE SECOND PHASE -- ONCE AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON HOW THE DIALOGUE
WILL BE HELD -- IS WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED.  IN THAT REGARD, OUR GOVERNMENT
HAS NOT SET ANY CONDITIONS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC, BECAUSE WE
KNOW THAT WE MUST FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY THINGS, AND WE ARE WILLING TO DO
SO.  THE ONLY CONDITION WE HAVE DEMANDED FOR THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS IS THAT,
ONCE IT BEGINS, IT SHOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY REASON.  WE BELIEVE
THAT PEOPLE WANT PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND WE CANNOT HOLD TALKS FOR
YEARS.  ONCE WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, THAT DIALOGUE SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL AN
OVERALL SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THE CONFLICT.  THAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT'S
POSITION, AND WE MAINTAIN THAT POSITION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS THE MOST
LOGICAL ONE."

   TURNING TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO
SOLVE THREE PROBLEMS:  THE FISCAL DEFICIT, INFLATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.  HE
SAYS THAT AS A FIRST STEP TO BEGIN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS TO
REFORM THE GOVERNMENT'S PRICING POLICY, ADDING:  "WE MUST PROTECT LOW-INCOME
GROUPS, AND FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE ASKED THE ECONOMY MINISTER TO BEGIN A
PROCESS AIMED AT ELIMINATING PRICE CONTROLS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN
ELIMINATE PRICE CONTROLS ON 230 PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE
MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WE CAN KEEP STAPLE PRODUCTS UNDER THE
CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY."  HE SAYS THAT PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLES
LIKE BASIC GRAINS, POWDERED MILK, FLOUR, COFFEE, SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL AND
LARD, CEMENT FOR HOUSING, AND OIL BY-PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED.

   REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: "WE AGREED
WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE.
TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE
POPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO
OFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE
TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF SERVICE THEY WANT TO USE: WHETHER THEY CONTINUE
TO USE THE LOW-PRICED SERVICE OR A BETTER, MORE COMFORTABLE, AND
FASTER SERVICE."

   ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: "WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO
ELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED,
THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO
LIVE NORMALLY.  THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLY
PROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME.  WE BELIEVE THAT
WITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC
EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] SOLVE PROBLEMS."

   TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS:  "WE HAVE TO TAKE
SHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO.  IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKE
MEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES. THUS, WE HAVE ASKED
THE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES.  HE IS TO
CONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASIC
BREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX.  WE HAVE TO START
ELIMINATING TAX EXEMPTIONS.  ONLY EXPORTS SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF MONETARY
INCENTIVE BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS EXPORTS.  THE
REST OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECTORS SHOULD BE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE."

   CRISTIANI ADDS:  "WE ARE GOING TO MODIFY THE SYSTEM OF PAYING INCOME
TAX.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASED ON UNJUST REGULATIONS, ON
REVENUES EARNED THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT DO NOT REFLECT A FIRM'S PRESENT
SITUATION.  THUS, WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST THAT INCOME-TAX PAYMENTS BE BASED
ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRM'S PRESENT SALES; THESE ARE A TRUER AND
MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF A FIRM'S INCOME."

   CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY'S MONETARY POLICY MUST BE AIMED AT
INCREASING SAVINGS TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HE SAYS THAT
IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE INTEREST RECEIVED ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN THE
COUNTRY'S BANKS MORE ATTRACTIVE SO THAT CAPITAL DOES NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY.
REGARDING THE COUNTRY'S CURRENCY, CRISTIANI SAYS:  "WE FEEL THAT CURRENCY
VALUE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN
EXCHANGE.  WE DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO
ARBITRARILY DEVALUE AND FIX AN EXCHANGE RATE ON THE SALVADORAN COLON.
EVERYTHING MUST BE BASED ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OUR COUNTRY MAY HAVE TO
PAY OUT FOR IMPORTS, BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO FIX THE RATE AT 10 [COLONES] TO
1 [DOLLAR], THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOREIGN
EXCHANGE TO COVER ALL THE IMPORTERS' DEMANDS."

   SANTIAGO, 16 JUL 89 -- [STATEMENT] [CHILEAN SOCIALIST PARTY, PS] [TEXT]

   1. DURING THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, CHILEAN FOREIGN RELATIONS WERE
DIVIDED INTO TWO PROCESSES. ON THE ONE HAND, AS THE DICTATORSHIP BECAME
MORE AND MORE ISOLATED, IT WAS INCREASINGLY CONDEMNED IN INTERNATIONAL
FORA AND REPUDIATED BY INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS
MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR A
FREE CHILE AND GENEROUSLY GRANTED THEIR SOLIDARITY TO OUR CAUSE, OUR
ORGANIZATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES BECAME INCREASINGLY OPEN TO THE
WORLD. THUS, THEY EXPANDED THEIR HORIZONS AND CONTRIBUTED THEIR
EXPERIENCES.

   2. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE PARTY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED ITS
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND ENHANCED ITS VISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL
SITUATION. IT HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES'
REVOLUTIONARY AND DEMOCRATIC CAUSE, AND IT HAS FULLY IMMERSED ITSELF IN THE
GREAT DEBATES OF WORLD SOCIALISM. TO THESE DEBATES WE BROUGHT OUR VIEWS ON A
PROFOUNDLY RENEWED LEFTIST SOCIALISM COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT,
AND SOCIAL CHANGE.

   3. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE PARTIES THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNATIONAL
SOCIALIST [SI] AND WITH THE SI ORGANIZATION ITSELF HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITHIN
THIS CONTEXT. THIS STRENGTHENING OF TIES HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF TWO THINGS.
FIRST, IT IS BASED ON THE POSITION THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PRINCIPLES
THE SI HAS UPHELD REGARDING THE CHILEAN SITUATION. IN OCTOBER 1973, A FEW
DAYS AFTER THE COUP, SI CHAIRMAN WILLY BRANDT CONDEMNED THE END OF THE
CHILEAN DEMOCRACY AND PRESIDENT ALLENDE'S ASSASSINATION AT THE UN GENERAL
ASSEMBLY. AT THE TIME HE ALSO SAID THIS WAS A GREAT STEP BACKWARD FOR THOSE
WHO ASPIRED TO ACHIEVE SOCIALISM THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. SINCE THEN, THE
SI HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY MOBILIZED IN FAVOR OF CHILE BY MAKING THE CHILEAN
CAUSE AND SALVADOR ALLENDE THE SYMBOLS OF ALL INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR
DEMOCRACY AND CHANGE. IT IS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK OF INTEREST AND
COOPERATION THAT THE VOICE OF CHILEAN SOCIALISM HAS BEEN HEARD AND OUR IDEAS
AND PROPOSALS PRAISED.

   4. THE SECOND REASON STEMS FROM THE PROCESS OF EXPANSION AND
TRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE SI IN THE PAST 2 DECADES. THE OVERALL
PROCESS OF CHANGE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WORLD DURING THIS PERIOD -- THE
TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG NATIONS,
EXPANSION OF COMMUNICATIONS, GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND MILITARY PROLIFERATION, THE
EMERGENCE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS, THE
WORSENING OF EXTREME POVERTY AND INTERNATIONAL INEQUALITIES, THE PROGRESS OF
LIBERATION STRUGGLES IN THE THIRD WORLD, INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE
VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS -- HAS ALSO EFFECTED MAJOR CHANGES IN
THE IDEAS AND POSITIONS OF SOCIALIST PARTIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS
FRAMEWORK, THE SI HAS EXPANDED ITS OUTLOOK, HAS INCREASINGLY RENEWED ITS
IDEAS AND, ABOVE ALL, HAS ACCEPTED PLURALISM WITHIN ITS FOLD AS WELL AS A
BROAD INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF AN
AUTONOMOUS, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS DEBATE
ACQUIRED A DEMOCRATIC, ANTIFASCIST CONTENT AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR ROLE
PLAYED BY SOCIALIST FORCES THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A LONG ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE.

OPINION OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE
POLITICAL PARTIES?

   [AZCONA] WELL, I READ THE AGREEMENT LAST NIGHT AND BELIEVE IT TO BE A
STEP FORWARD.  INCIDENTALLY, I READ IT TWICE LAST NIGHT AND IT IS A VERY
LONG DOCUMENT.  I AM TALKING ABOUT THE AGREEMENT WITH THE PARTIES THAT ARE
TRULY OPPOSITION PARTIES AND NOT THE ONE MADE WITH THE OTHER PARTIES BECAUSE
THESE ARE NOT REALLY OPPOSITION PARTIES.

   [REPORTER] WHAT I WANTED WAS YOUR OPINION ON THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE
CONTRAS FROM HONDURAS.  

   [AZCONA] OH, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SMALL DOCUMENT THAT MAKES DEMANDS,
DEMANDS, AND MORE DEMANDS.  THIS DOCUMENT HAS NO VALUE.  

   [REPORTER] I MEAN THE DOCUMENT SIGNED WITH THE 21 POLITICAL
PARTIES...  

   [AZCONA, INTERRUPTING] THAT AGREEMENT IS VALUABLE BUT IT DOES NOT
MENTION THE CONTRA DEMOBILIZATION.  THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THE
NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION PARTIES AGREE THAT THE
ESQUIPULAS II AND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS SHOULD BE ABIDED BY.  THIS
IS THE DOCUMENT I READ TWICE, AND I BELIEVE IT IS QUITE SERIOUS AND A
STEP FORWARD.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET THE MERCENARIES TO LEAVE YOUR
COUNTRY?

   [AZCONA] FIRST, I DO NOT USE DEROGATORY TERMS.  THEY ARE
NICARAGUANS WHO FOR DIFFERENT REASONS DISAGREE WITH THE SYSTEM IN
NICARAGUA.  THESE NICARAGUANS OPPOSE THE SYSTEM, AND FOR THIS AND OTHER
REASONS THEY HAVE TAKEN UP ARMS AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN
HONDURAS.  I DO NOT USE THE TERM MERCENARY.  I UNDERSTAND THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT USES IT AND IT IS ALL RIGHT FOR THEM TO DO SO, BUT I WILL NOT
ANSWER A QUESTION THAT USES A TERM THAT I BELIEVE IS TOO DEROGATORY.

   [REPORTER] THE DEMOBILIZATION PLAN HAS A VERY FIRM DEADLINE AND IS TO BE
COMPLETED WITHIN 90 DAYS.  DO YOU THINK...

   [AZCONA, INTERRUPTING] NO, NO.  THE 90-DAY DEADLINE IS INCLUDED IN AN
AGREEMENT SIGNED BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA WITH THREE SMALL NICARAGUAN
LEFTIST PARTIES.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS DOCUMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT.  I DO
BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT AND
THE OPPOSITION PARTIES IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS II
AND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] TERRORISTS IN EL SALVADOR
AND CONTRAS ARE PRESENTLY NOT ACTIVE, SO BOTH SITUATIONS -- CONTRAS AND
GUERRILLAS -- ARE DIFFERENT.

   [REPORTER] IS IT TRUE THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS GOING TO PRESENT A
PARALLEL PROGRAM AT THE SUMMIT?

   [AZCONA] [WORDS INDISTINCT] PRESIDENT CRISTIANI COMES TO THE SUMMIT AS EL
SALVADOR'S LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT.  HE HAS THE RIGHT TO PRESENT HIS POINTS OF
VIEW.  HE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS IN OTHER
COUNTRIES AS WELL AS TO ONES IN HIS OWN COUNTRY.

   [REPORTER] IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN FOR THE
SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS WILL BE STUDIED AT THIS SUMMIT IF PRESIDENT CRISTINAI
PRESENTS ONE?

   [AZCONA] OF COURSE.  HE HAS A RIGHT TO DO SO.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 17 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] TWO
CRIMINAL ATTACKS, THE RESIGNATION OF THREE JUDGES, AND A 24-HOUR
STRIKE BY WORKERS IN THE JUDICIAL SECTOR--THIS SUMS UP THE JUDICIAL
SITUATION IN COLOMBIA OVER THE PAST 20 DAYS.  THE CHAOTIC SITUATION
UNLEASHED IN BOGOTA LAST NIGHT WITH THE ASSASINATION OF JUSTICE CARLOS
VALENCIA BEGAN ON 28 JULY IN MEDELLIN, WHEN MOTORIZED PAID ASSASINS
MURDERED THIRD PUBLIC ORDER JUDGE MARIA ELENA DIAZ.  DIAZ' MURDER
UNLEASHED A WAVE OF PROTESTS; 17,000 EMPEMPLOYEES FROM THE LEGAL
SECTOR STAGED A STRIKE ON 1 AUGUST AND FORCED A STATEMENT FROM THE
GOVERNMENT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THE JUDICIAL
BRANCH ANTONIO SUAREZ] I AM WARNING THE COUNTRY THAT THE NEXT MURDER IN THE
JUDICIAL BRANCH WILL NECESSARILY RESULT IN THE COLLECTIVE RESIGNATION OF ALL
THE JUDGES.  [END RECORDING]

   PROTECTIVE MEASURES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED FOR ALL JUDGES AND WORK
CONTINUES.  ON 14 AUGUST, DUE TO DEATH THREATS AGAINST HIS DAUGHTER,
FIRST PUBLIC ORDER JUDGE ALVARO MEDINA MORENO, WHO WAS INVESTIGATING
THE WANUMEN ARMS-TRAFFICKING CASE AND THE ATTACK ON THE DAS
[ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] DIRECTOR, ANNOUNCED HIS
RESIGNATION.  TWO DAYS LATER, ON 16 AUGUST, DUE TO DEATH THREATS THE
EIGHTH PUBLIC ORDER JUDGE IN MEDELLIN, WHO WAS INVESTIGATING THE
GOVERNOR OF ANTIOQUIA'S MURDER, RESIGNED.

   SHORTLY BEFORE JUSTICE VALENCIA'S MURDER YESTERDAY, THE SEVENTH PUBLIC
ORDER JUDGE IN BOGOTA, WHO WAS INVESTIGATING THE SEARCH OF A BUILDING IN
NORTHERN BOGOTA, DECIDED TO RESIGN AND LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  TO CONCLUDE, THE
INTIMIDATION OF JUDGES LED TO VALENCIA'S MURDER LAST NIGHT IN DOWNTOWN
BOGOTA.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED WITNESSES] TWO PEOPLE APPROACHED VALENCIA
AND BEGAN SHOOTING AT HIM.  VALENCIA'S BODYGUARDS STOOPED DOWN, THEY DID NOT
HAVE TIME TO RESPOND.  WHEN THEIR ATTACKERS FLED, THE BODYGUARDS CAME OUT
AND BEGAN SHOOTING WILDLY.  IT WAS A DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR PEOPLE IN THE
AREA.  [END RECORDING]

   STUPEFIED BY THE CRIMINAL ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIAL SECTOR, THE GOVERNMENT
IS SEEKING WAYS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF INTIMIDATION.

   MADRID EFE IN SPANISH AT 1824 GMT ON 17 AUGUST REPORTS THAT "ANTONIO
SUAREZ NINO, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
(ASONAL), HAS REPORTED THAT ALL OF COLOMBIA'S JUDGES TODAY PRESENTED THEIR
RESIGNATIONS BECAUSE OF THE ASSASINATION LAST NIGHT OF JUSTICE CARLOS

   "THE PRESIDENT OF ASONAL ANNOUNCED THE RESIGNATION EN MASSE OF THE
COUNTRY'S JUDGES, SAYING THEY WILL PRESENT THEIR RESIGNATIONS AT THE
COUNTRY'S HIGHER COURTS, AND HE REQUESTED A MEETING WITH COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT
VIRGILIO BARCO.

   "ASONAL PRESIDENT ANTONIO SUAREZ SAID THAT 'IN RESPONSE TO THIS HORRIBLE
MASSACRE OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH, WE HAVE DECREED AN INDEFINITE STRIKE AND
THE RESIGNATION EN MASSE OF ALL THE JUDGES, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE
NOT IN ANY CONDITION TO CONTINUE KILLING EACH OTHER WITH IMPUNITY WHILE THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH LOOKS ON ALMOST COMPLACENTLY.'"

AUTHENTIC POLITICAL RESOLVE TO GUARANTEE AND PROTECT THE INTEGRITY AND LIVES
OF ILLUSTRIOUS FELLOW PATRIOTS SUCH AS VALENCIA.'"

   HAVANA (CUBA), 19 AUG 89 (HACIENDO RADIO) -- [COMMENTARY] [ORLANDO
CONTRERAS] [TEXT] DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS, VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA HAS
TAKEN SPECTACULAR TURNS.  ACCORDING TO A REPORT WHICH CITES RELIABLE
SOURCES, IT SEEMS THAT THE HAND OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS IS BEHIND THE
ASSASSINATIONS OF JUDGE CARLOS VALENCIA, OF THE BOGOTA [WORDS
INDISTINCT], WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY [18 AUGUST].  THE COLOMBIAN DRUG
MAFIA HAS CREATED A GREAT MONEY AND CRIME EMPIRE IN COLOMBIA WITH
POWERFUL RAMIFICATIONS OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED
STATES -- THE MAIN CONSUMER OF COCAINE AND OTHER DRUGS IN THE WORLD.

   YESTERDAY [18 AUGUST], VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ
SPOKE ON THE PHONE WITH HIS COLOMBIAN COUNTERPART, VIRGILIO BARCO, AND
IT IS SAID THAT THE MAIN SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION WAS THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUTH DELINQUENCY AND DRUG TRAFFICKING.  IT IS
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES
PEREZ.  WE MUST REFLECT, SAID CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ON THE NEED FOR US,
ALL VENEZUELANS, TO FACE DRUG TRAFFICKING IN VENEZUELA.  WE MUST ALSO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING IS THE ABOMINABLE CRIME OF OUR
TIMES, AND THAT THERE CANNOT BE ANY HESITATION OR COMPASSION TOWARD
DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ.

   IN REALITY, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING DRAMA IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTING SEVERAL
LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  WE HAVE THE DRAMATIC CASE OF COLOMBIA, BUT THE
SITUATION ALSO EXISTS IN VENEZUELA, BOLIVIA, PERU, WELL, IN SEVERAL LATIN
AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  NOW, THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM...[REPHRASES] AS HAS
BEEN POINTED OUT BY LATIN AMERICANS THEMSELVES AND THEIR MOST PROMINENT
FIGURES, THE FINAL SOLUTION TO THE DRAMATIC DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM MUST BE
BASED ON PUTTING AN END TO THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.  THAT IS THE MAIN
STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THE UNITED STATES IS
THE MAIN CONSUMPTION CENTER OF DRUGS IN THE WORLD, AND U.S. POLICY ON DRUG
TRAFFICKING IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE NEED TO PUT AN END AND ACTIVELY
REPRESS THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.  U.S.  POLICY, AND ALL THIS IS VERY WELL
KNOWN IN LATIN AMERICA, IS BASED ON DESTROYING THE PLANTATIONS OF A NATIVE
PLANT IN THE CONTINENT, WHICH IS COCA.  PRESIDENTS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL
FIGURES OF THE CONTINENT HAVE SAID THAT THE SOLUTION IS NOT BASED ON THE
DESTRUCTION OF A NATIVE PLANT BUT IN ACTIVE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG CONSUMPTION.

   I THINK THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA AND THE
DRAMATIC SITUATION THAT COLOMBIA IS FACING THESE DAYS CONFIRM THAT THE
POLICY FOR FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING MUST BE TENACIOUS, STRONG, WITHOUT
HESITATION AND COMPASSION.  IT MUST ALSO BE BASED ON ENDING DRUG CONSUMPTION
BY THE UNITED STATES -- THE MAIN DRUG CONSUMER OF THE WORLD -- WHICH LIVES
PRECISELY FROM DRUG CONSUMPTION AND ITS BUSINESS.

   BOGOTA, 23 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE ISRAELI EMBASSY IN BOGOTA TODAY
CONFIRMED THAT THERE ARE ISRAELI TERRORISTS IN COLOMBIA ENGAGED IN TRAINING
RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS THAT, ACCORDING TO INVESTIGATIONS, ARE
FINANCED BY DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS.

   ISRAELI CHARGE D'AFFAIRS MICHEL RONEN ADMITTED THERE ARE SEVERAL ISRAELIS
ENGAGED IN THAT ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, BUT WARNED THAT THEY DO SO "ON THEIR OWN
AND DO NOT ACT ON BEHALF OF MY GOVERNMENT."

   MOREOVER, THIS OFFICIAL DENIED THAT JUBIZ HAZVUMB, CAPTURED 22 AUGUST BY
COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES FOR HIS ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE MURDER OF SENATOR
AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WAS AN ISRAELI CITIZEN.

   ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS REVEALED BY THE PRESS, THE SUSPECT IS AN
ISRAELI MERCENARY PAID BY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL -- THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL
DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIA -- THAT APPEARS TO BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE MURDERS
OF GALAN, A HIGH-RANKING POLICE OFFICER, AND A JUDGE LAST WEEK.

   REPORTS DISCLOSING THE PRESENCE OF THESE TERRORISTS IN COLOMBIA APPEARED
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHEN TELEVISION CLIPS SHOWED A MAN GIVING INSTRUCTIONS IN
HEBREW TO A RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY SQUAD.

   SIMILAR CLIPS WERE BROADCAST BY THE U.S. TELEVISION NETWORK NBC,
PROMPTING A COMMUNIQUE FROM JERUSALEM WHICH REQUESTED COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES
AND INTERPOL TO PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION ON THE MATTER.

   ACORDING TO THE ISRAELI OFFICIAL, THE TERRORISTS' ACTIONS IN COLOMBIA RUN
"COUNTER TO ISRAEL'S POLICIES."  

   INVESTIGATIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS) -- THE
STATE'S INTELLIGENCE CORPS -- DISCLOSED THE LINKS BETWEEN THE
DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS AND ULTRARIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS.

   ACCORDING TO DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ, THE
DRUG-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, SET UP
SEVERAL "SCHOOLS FOR GUNMEN" IN A VAST REGION IN THE INTERIOR OF THE
COUNTRY WITH ISRAELI, BRITISH, U.S. AND WEST GERMAN TERRORIST
INSTRUCTORS.  MOREOVER, NBC WARNED OF THE PRESENCE OF SOUTH AFRICANS.

   THE PARAMILITARY SQUADS ARE ACCUSED OF HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUAL MURDERS AND
MASSACRES AGAINST POLITICAL AND LABOR LEADERS, AS WELL AS PEASANTS AND
PATRIOTIC UNION LEFTIST MILITANTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE AUTHORITIES ARE ACCUSING THESE SQUADS' KILLERS OF BEING BEHIND THE
CRIME WAVE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING SINCE LAST WEEK, WITH THE
MURDERS OF PEOPLE KNOWN FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES AGAINST COCAINE TRAFFICKING.

   TEL AVIV (ISRAEL), 3 SEP 89 (HADASHOT) -- [REPORT] [SHMU'EL
ROSENBLUM] [TEXT] IN THE WAKE OF THE COLOMBIAN AFFAIR, SIMILAR ISRAELI
ACTIVITY HAS BEEN REVEALED IN NEIGHBORING PERU AND BOLIVIA.  THESE TWO
COUNTRIES ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR COCAINE CROPS AND THE DRUG CARTEL'S
ORGANIZED ACTIVITIES.  IN ADDITION, EXTREMIST RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING
ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL GOALS
THROUGH TERRORIST ACTIVITY.

   HADASHOT HAS LEARNED FROM A SOURCE WHO WAS IN PERU FOR ABOUT 6
MONTHS THAT ELEMENTS LINKED TO THE DRUG GROWERS SPENT APPROXIMATELY $9
MILLION ON MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM ISRAELI ARMS DEALERS IN 1987.  THE
EQUIPMENT INCLUDED GALIL RIFLES, FLAK JACKETS, AMMUNITION BELTS AND
AMMUNITION, VARIOUS TYPES OF GRENADES, AND COMMUNICATIONS AND NIGHT
VISION EQUIPMENT.  IN 1988 AND 1989, IN ADDITIONAL DEALS WORTH SOME $6
MILLION, MORTARS, SHELLS, SNIPER RIFLES, AND AMMUNITION FOR LIGHT
WEAPONS WERE PURCHASED.

   THE ARMS WERE SENT TO PERU VIA MEXICO AND GUATEMALA.  AT LEAST 3
IDF [ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES] RESERVE OFFICERS WERE IN PERU FOR
OVER 2 MONTHS IN EARLY 1988 TO ORGANIZE FIGHTING UNITS.  THE PERUVIAN
FIGHTERS WERE PRESENTED TO THE OFFICERS AS BELONGING TO RIGHT-WING
POLITICAL BODIES IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS INCLUDED
MERCENARIES FROM THE NETHERLANDS AND ENGLAND.

   THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS WAS MADE UP OF SOME 10 PEOPLE, SOME OF WHOM
WERE RECRUITED THROUGH AN ISRAELI-NETHERLANDER ARMS DEALER WHO LIVES
IN AMSTERDAM.  THE NETHERLANDS MEDIA IS CONDUCTING A WIDE-RANGING
INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUBJECT DESPITE THE SURPRISING LACK OF INTEREST
BY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES IN THE AFFAIR.

   AT THE SAME TIME, ISRAELIS IN NEIGHBORING BOLIVIA ACTED AS
INSTRUCTORS IN A COURSE ON SAFEGUARDING BUSINESSMEN, GUERRILLA
WARFARE, AND REGIONAL DEFENSE.  THESE ISRAELIS REACHED BOLIVIA IN THE
WAKE OF AN ARMS CONSIGNMENT WORTH SOME $12 MILLION, WHICH ARRIVED IN
PERU [COUNTRY AS PUBLISHED] VIA A THIRD PARTY, WHICH PURCHASED IT IN
AN AFRICAN COUNTRY, WHICH IN TURN HAD RECEIVED IT FROM ISRAEL.

   FOLLOWING THE REPORTS ON DEALS BY ISRAELIS ABROAD, THE INCOME TAX
INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION HAS BEGUN AN INQUIRY INTO TAX PAYMENTS ON
ISRAELI ARMS DEALS AND TRAINING ABROAD.

   IN THE PAST 5 YEARS, THE SCOPE OF COMMISSIONS PAID TO ARMS DEALERS
IS ESTIMATED AT $1 BILLION.  AT LEAST HALF OF IT WENT TO BIG DEALERS,
SUCH AS SHA'UL EISENBERG, MARCUS KATZ, PESAH BEN-OR, ISRACES, AND
OTHERS.  THEY ARE NOT UNDER SUSPICION OF TRYING TO CHEAT OR HIDE
INFORMATION FROM THE TAX AUTHORITIES.

   BOGOTA, 4 SEP 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] THIS STATION HAS
LEARNED THAT THREE PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AT THE JOSE MARIA CORDOBA
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, IN THE TOWN OF RIO NEGRO, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT.
ONE OF THE PERSONS KILLED WAS WEARING A MILITARY UNIFORM, BUT WE STILL
DO NOT KNOW IF HE WAS IN DISGUISE OR IF HE BELONGED TO THE SECURITY
CORPS.  ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS FROM THE ANTIOQUIA POLICE,
THIS WAS AN ATTACK ON THE INSTALLATIONS OF THE JOSE MARIA CORDOBA
AIRPORT.  I REPEAT: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY REPORT BY THE ANTIOQUIA
POLICE.  RIGHT NOW, TOP OFFICIALS AND ANTIOQUIA POLICE CHIEFS ARE ON
THEIR WAY TO THE AIRPORT.  THE AIRPORT HAS BEEN SEALED OFF, AND PEOPLE
ARE TRAPPED INSIDE OFFICES THERE.  NO ONE IS ALLOWED NEAR THE SCENE OF
THE VIOLENT SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE THERE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.

   A SEARCH IS UNDER WAY THROUGHOUT RIO NEGRO'S SAN NICOLAS VALLEY,
WHERE THE AIRPORT IS LOCATED, FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS ATTACK, WHO
ARE NOW BELIEVED TO BE DRIVING TWO YELLOW RENAULTS AND ARE BEING
PURSUED BY THE POLICE.  I REPEAT: SO FAR, WE KNOW THAT THREE PERSONS
HAVE BEEN KILLED INSIDE THE AIRPORT.  ONE OF THOSE KILLED WAS WEARING
A MILITARY UNIFORM.  THE ANTIOQUIA POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THIS WAS
AN ATTACK ON THE AIRPORT INSTALLATIONS.

   WE STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO LEARN IF THE ATTACK WAS TARGETED
AGAINST ANYONE IN PARTICULAR.

   MEDELLIN, 4 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] TWO PERSONS WERE INJURED IN
DYNAMITE ATTACKS PERPETRATED THIS EVENING AGAINST TWO BANK BRANCHES IN
THIS NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIAN CITY.

   THE FIRST POLICE REPORTS INDICATE THAT A BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF
THE STATE-OWNED AGRARIAN BOARD IN THE SUBURBS OF MANRIQUE, AND ANOTHER
AT THE AGRARIAN BOARD BRANCH IN THE SECTOR OF ARANJUEZ.

   ONE PERSON WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN EACH OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS,
BUT NO DEATHS WERE REPORTED.

   THE DEVICE WHICH EXPLODED IN MANRIQUE DESTROYED THE BANK BUILDING
AND A BUS THAT WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING, AND CAUSED
CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE IN SEVERAL STORES NEARBY.

   THE EXPLOSION IN THE OTHER BRANCH WAS OF A LESSER MAGNITUDE, AND IT
BROKE WINDOWS AND CAUSED DAMAGE INSIDE THE OFFICES.

   THE SCANT POLICE INFORMATION SAID THAT THE DEVICES WERE APPARENTLY
LEFT IN FRONT OF THE TWO BANK BRANCHES MINUTES BEFORE THE CURFEW BEGAN
FOR THE 6TH CONSECUTIVE DAY--PRECISELY TO COUNTER THE WAVE OF
TERRORISM CAUSED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   THESE REPRESENT THE SECOND AND THIRD DYNAMITE ATTACKS IN MEDELLIN
THIS EVENING. THE PREVIOUS ONE TOOK PLACE 2 HOURS EARLIER AND BLEW UP
A POLICE POST, BUT FAILED TO INJURE ITS FIVE OCCUPANTS.

   BOGOTA, 13 SEP 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [TEXT] DAS
[ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] DIRECTOR MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ
CONFIRMED TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES HAD
KNOWN FOR OVER 1 YEAR THAT THERE WERE MERCENARIES IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT
POLICE AUTHORITIES APPARENTLY PREVENTED AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAD BEEN
ORDERED, AS A MATTER OF FACT, BY A FEMALE JUDGE.  OUR REPORTER
HERNANDO CORRALES HAS THE DETAILS:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CORRALES] IF THE AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF AN
OPERATION NEAR PUERTO BOYACA ON 18 JULY LAST YEAR HAD NOT SABOTAGED
IT, THE FOREIGN INSTRUCTORS AT THE SERVICE OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL
WOULD NOW BE JAIL.  ON THAT DATE, MARTA LUCIA GONZALEZ, SECOND JUDGE
OF PUBLIC ORDER, WROTE A FILE NOTE SAYING THAT THE JUDICIAL INSPECTION
WAS UNJUSTLY TORPEDOED WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND
AND THAT THIS ARGUMENT WAS SENSELESS AND ILLOGICAL SINCE ABSOLUTELY NO
ONE OTHER THAN THE UNDERSIGNED JUDGE COULD DECIDE IF HE OR SHE HAD
ANYTHING TO INSPECT, OR IF HE OR SHE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT CONDUCT THE
JUDICIAL PROCEEDING.

   THE DOCUMENT, WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE DOSSIER ON THE MASSACRE IN
LA HONDURA AND LA NEGRA, URABA REGION, SAYS THAT SHE WAS LEFT 2 DAYS
INSIDE A PLANE AT THE AIRPORT OF THE TEXAS PETROLEUM COMPANY IN PUERTO
BOYACA AND THAT THE POLICE AUTHORITIES ACCOMPANYING HER FAILED TO
EXPLAIN TO HER WHY THEY HAD NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION.

   [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] IN FACT, SHE AND SEVERAL DAS INSPECTORS
ENCOUNTERED SOME OBSTACLES.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WAS
INFORMED OF THESE OBSTACLES IN ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION.
I THINK THAT WHEN SHE AND THE DAS PERSONNEL WERE PREPARING TO GO TO
PUERTO BOYACA IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE PRESENT
THERE FOR THESE PROCEEDINGS AND THIS WAS QUITE WORRISOME.

   [CORRALES] AS IS KNOWN, JUDGE GONZALEZ HAD TO LEAVE COLOMBIA
BECAUSE HER LIFE WAS THREATENED, AND HER FATHER, FORMER BOYACA
GOVERNOR ALVARO GONZALEZ SANTANA, WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MURDERED.

   MOREOVER, GEN MAZA MARQUEZ SAID FURTHER THAT THE FACT THAT A
PAYMENT IS BEING OFFERED FOR THE CAPTURE OF PABLO ESCOBAR AND GONZALO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA DOES NOT MEAN THAT OTHER PERSONS ACCUSED OF BEING
CAPOS OF THE MAFIA ARE NOT BEING SOUGHT TOO.

   [MAZA] WE ARE TAKING ACTION THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE COUNTRY.
WE ARE NOT SHOWING ANY SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS BECAUSE WE INTEND TO ACT
INDISCRIMINATELY.  WHAT WE WANT IS TO FIGHT A SCOURGE THAT HAS GREATLY
HARMED ALL COLOMBIANS.

   [CORRALES] THE DAS DIRECTOR SAID THAT IF ANYONE BEING HELD IN
CONNECTION WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE KILLING OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN
IS RELEASED, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT
PROCEEDING WELL.  [END RECORDING]

   GUATEMALA CITY, 18 SEP 89 (TELEONCE) -- [TEXT] THE TOPIC ABOUT
VIOLENCE AND THE PROCEDURES ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO COUNTER IT
WERE DISCUSSED ON 18 SEPTEMBER DURING THE INAUGURATION OF THE
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC INTERNATIONAL WORLD ASSEMBLY.  GUATEMALAN
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO GAVE THE INAUGURATION SPEECH AND REVEALED THE
PLANS TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] THERE ARE SOME STUBBORN PEOPLE WHO REFUSE
TO ACCEPT THAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE PEACEFULLY AND FREELY.  THERE ARE
EVEN SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE USING VIOLENCE TO IMPOSE THEIR IDEAS; THERE
ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COUNTER THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE'S IDEAS WITH
CONFRONTATION AND POLARIZATION.  THOSE PERSONS ARE PREPARING RIGHT NOW
A PLOT AGAINST GUATEMALA'S DEMOCRACY.  IT IS PERHAPS THE MOST CRUEL,
HARSH, AND AUDACIOUS PLOT EVER PREPARED IN THE NATION'S 4 YEARS OF
DEMOCRATIC HISTORY, BECAUSE -- AND I WANT YOU TO CAREFULLY LISTEN TO
THIS -- THEY HAVE DECIDED TO KILL PROMINENT POLITICAL AND LABOR
LEADERS SO THAT THE PEOPLE BLAME THE GOVERNMENT -- REMEMBERING THE
TRAGEDIES WHICH OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND THE ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTS
WHICH DECIDED TO KEEP, WITH DEATH AND REPRESSION, THE PRIVILEGES THAT
THEY HAD NOT EARNED.

   THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A RIFT BETWEEN THE GUATEMALAN
PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT; THEY WANT US TO FALL INTO A TRAP. [END
RECORDING]

   PRESIDENT CEREZO ADDRESSED THE DELEGATES OF 54 COUNTRIES WHO ARE
PARTICIPATING IN THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC INTERNATIONAL WORLD
ASSEMBLY, ASSERTING THAT THE EFFORTS TO BE EXERTED BY HIS GOVERNMENT
TO COUNTER TERRORISM SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY.  HE SAID NO ONE SHOULD CONDEMN HIS GOVERNMENT WITHOUT FULLY
UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO ALSO PLEDGED TO USE EVERY AVAILABLE MEANS TO
LOCATE THOSE WHO PERPETRATE ACTS OF TERRORISM.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] -- [BROADCAST IN PROGRESS] ...CRIMINALS
AND WE ARE ALREADY LOOKING FOR THEM!  [APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL PUNISH
THEM ACCORDING TO THE LAW, TO GIVE BACK TO THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE THE
LIBERTY THAT THEY HAVE ENJOYED FOR 3 AND 1/2 YEARS -- BECAUSE IT IS
THE RESULT OF MANY YEARS OF SACRIFICE! [APPLAUSE] [END RECORDING]

   BOGOTA, 21 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] AUTHORITIES HAVE OFFICIALLY
REPORTED THAT SEVERAL BANK OFFICES WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED TONIGHT IN
THE CHAPINERO NEIGHBORHOOD OF NORTHERN BOGOTA WHEN TWO BOMBS EXPLODED,
CAUSING MINOR INJURIES TO A CHILD AND A SECURITY GUARD.

   THE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED BY THE DOOR OF A BANCO DE OCCIDENTE BRANCH
AT 2115 LOCAL TIME (0215 GMT), AND THE SHOCK WAVE DAMAGED OTHER NEARBY
BANKS.

   FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION, A 9-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO LIVES NEAR THE BANCO
DE OCCIDENTE WAS WOUNDED BY PIECES OF GLASS, SAID HIS RELATIVES, WHO
TOOK HIM TO THE "MARLY" CLINIC NEAR THE AREA.

   AT THE SAME TIME, ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED AT A BANCO POPULAR BRANCH,
TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE THE FIRST EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE, POLICE
SAID.

   OTHER BANKS AND SHOPS WERE DAMAGED BY THE SECOND EXPLOSION, AND THE
SECURITY GUARD AT THE BANCO POPULAR WAS ALSO INJURED BY PIECES OF
FLYING GLASS, THE AUTHORITIES SAID.

   ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, TWO MEN PLACED THE EXPLOSIVE
DEVICES AND LEFT THE SCENE ON FOOT.

   BOTH OF THESE ATTACKS TONIGHT, ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKING
CARTELS, TOOK PLACE AFTER 10 BOMBS EXPLODED EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE
TEUSAQUILLO AREA IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA.  THE BOMBS WERE PLACED IN NINE
POLITICAL OFFICES OF THE LIBERAL AND SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTIES AND
IN ANOTHER BANK OFFICE.

   BOGOTA, 28 SEP 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
GENERAL OCTAVIO VARGAS SILVA, COLOMBIAN NATIONAL POLICE OPERATIONAL
COMMANDER, BY EDUARDO CARRILLO] [TEXT] [CARRILLO] I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH
WITH GENERAL OCTAVIO VARGAS SILVA, NATIONAL POLICE OPERATIONAL
COMMANDER AND INSPECTOR.  GEN VARGAS HAS SAID THAT THE TWO PEOPLE WHO
WERE KILLED IN THE ATTACK THAT TOOK PLACE AT SUBA MUNICIPALITY LAST
NIGHT HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED.

   [VARGAS] TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND FIVE OTHERS WERE WOUNDED AS A
RESULT OF THE ATTACK.  THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED ARE YET TO BE
IDENTIFIED.  THOSE WOUNDED INCLUDE THREE EMPLOYEES OF THE GAS STATION
WHERE THE CAR BOMB WENT OFF AND TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE WALKING BY THE GAS
STATION AT THE MOMENT OF THE EXPLOSION.  PRELIMINARY REPORTS HAVE
ESTIMATED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED 70 MILLION PESOS IN LOSSES.

   [CARRILLO] GENERAL, APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY KILOGRAMS OF EXPLOSIVES
WERE IN THE CAR BOMB?

   [VARGAS] APPARENTLY IT CONTAINED 60 KG OF DYNAMITE.  THE DYNAMITE
WAS PLACED INSIDE AN OLD STATION WAGON.  SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED
TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INSIDE THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION
-- THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED.  APPARENTLY THE CAR BOMB WENT OFF
BY ACCIDENT.  IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE GONE OFF AT THAT GAS
STATION.

   [CARRILLO] HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED BEEN IDENTIFIED?

   [VARGAS] NO, NOT YET.  WE ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY THEM NOW.

   [CARRILLO] ARE THERE SPECIAL SECURITY MEASURES TO COUNTER THIS WAVE
OF TERRORISM?

   [VARGAS] YES, OF COURSE.  WE ARE CARRYING OUT A SERIES OF JOINT
ACTIONS WITH THE BOGOTA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY PERSONNEL TO NEUTRALIZE TERRORIST ACTIONS.  WE
ARE CARRYING OUT THOSE ACTIONS IN AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL OR
VULNERABLE AND IN OTHER AREAS WHERE WE ARE COUNTERACTING AND
NEUTRALIZING TERRORIST ACTIONS, AS I TOLD YOU.

   [CARRILLO] ARE THERE SECRET AGENTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CITY?

   [VARGAS] YES, WE HAVE UNIFORMED AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL GUARDING THE
CITY RIGHT NOW.  WE ALSO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE BOGOTA POLICE
DEPARTMENT, OF DIJIN [DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND
INVESTIGATIONS], AND OF CIJIN [EXPANSION UNKNOWN]. THEY ARE
COOPERATING WITH US.  THEY ARE GUARDING AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL OR
PLACES THAT COULD BE TARGETS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS.

   [CARRILLO] WHAT OTHER MEASURES HAVE YOU ADOPTED ALONG WITH THE 13TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE BOGOTA MAYOR?

   [VARGAS] WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF MEASURES, SUCH AS
INCREASING PERSONNEL ON THE STREETS AND HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCES.
IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CHEKCKPOINTS IN AREAS WE CONSIDER
CRITICAL AND ARE CARRYING OUT A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT
WILL HELP US LOCATE THESE CRIMINALS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 SEP 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, SAID TODAY
THAT THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 26 SEPTEMBER BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, WAS A MISTAKEN STEP TAKEN BY THE
REBELS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT,
WHICH WAS RESUMED IN MEXICO.

   COL PONCE SAID THAT WITH THIS ATTITUDE THE REBELS ARE NOT SHOWING A
REAL DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND HE DESCRIBED IT AS A PROPAGANDISTIC ACTION.

   TODAY, DURING HIS TOUR OF VARIOUS AREAS OF CONFLICT, COL PONCE SAID
THAT RECENT FMLN ATTACKS ON VARIOUS MILITARY POSITIONS AS PART OF ITS
LATEST CAMPAIGN FOLLOWING THE UNILATERAL TRUCE WAS A SERIOUS MISTAKE
ON THE PART OF THE REBEL COMMANDERS, AS THEY HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN
THE MIDST OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH
HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS CONTINUOUS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] THAT SHOWS THERE ARE, ON THE ONE HAND,
THE PROPOSALS AND WHAT THE TERRORIST LEADERS CALL THEIR DESIRE FOR
PEACE, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE REAL ACTIONS.  I THINK THAT THE
CAMPAIGN THE FMLN HAS MOUNTED NATIONWIDE WAS A BAD STEP, BECAUSE IT
DOES NOT SHOW A REAL AND SINCERE DESIRE TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.
[END RECORDING]

   COLONEL PONCE ADDED THAT THE REQUEST FOR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF
TROOPS AS STATED IN THE GUERRILLA PROPOSAL IS A POLITICAL MOVE.  HE
PLAYED DOWN THE LATEST REBEL OFFER PRESENTED TO THE GOVERNMENT IN
MEXICO.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] THE PROPOSAL WAS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE
FMLN'S IMAGE ABROAD, WHICH HAD DETERIORATED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
THE PROPOSAL CAN BE DISCUSSED; HOWEVER, WE IN THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOT
THE ONES WHO WILL DISCUSS IT OR WHO WILL DECIDE WHETHER IT CAN OR
CANNOT BE ACCEPTED.  IT IS A POLITICAL DECISION, AND THE ARMED FORCES
WILL ACCEPT THE DECISION MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THE MILITARY
COMMANDERS ARE NOT THE ONES WHO MUST DECIDE ON THE NUMBER OF TROOPS
THE INSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE.  THIS IS A DECISION TO BE MADE BY THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS AND THREATS THE
COUNTRY MAY BE FACING. [END RECORDING]

   COLONEL PONCE VISITED THE POSITIONS OF THE ARMY'S BELLOSO AND
ATLACATL ELITE BATTALIONS IN THE TOWNS OF PERQUIN IN MORAZAN
DEPARTMENT AND LA LAGUNA IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, NEAR THE HONDURAN
BORDER, WHERE FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE.  DURING THIS MILITARY TOUR,
COL PONCE SAID THAT IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS NO
LIBERATED OR PERMANENTLY OCCUPIED TERRITORY IN EL SALVADOR.  HOWEVER,
THE REBELS CLAIM THEY CONTROL THAT AREA OF INTENSE CONFLICT WHERE THE
WAR HAS LEFT ITS INDELIBLE MARK.  


TST3-MUC4-0043

   NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), 29 SEP 89 -- [COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO MARTI
LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] SUCH AN
UNCONDITIONAL CEASE-FIRE DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THE SPIRIT OF THE
ESQUIPULAS AND TELA AGREEMENTS AND THE ACCORDS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
FMLN SIGNED IN MEXICO IN WHICH THE SIDES CLEARLY AGREED TO FIND
SOLUTIONS IN THE AREA AND IN EL SALVADOR.  ASKING FOR AN END TO THE
WAR AND NEGOTIATIONS IS LIKE DEMANDING THAT THE SITUATION BE CHANGED
WITHOUT HAVING WON THE WAR.  IN ADDITION TO BEING UNREALISTIC, THIS IS
A FORMULA FOR NOT NEGOTIATING AND CONTINUING THE WAR.

   IN THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENTS, THE GOVERNMENTS URGE THE SIDES TO
AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE.  THE TELA ACCORDS ALSO APPEAL TO THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN IN THE SPIRIT OF THE
ESQUIPULAS II ACCORDS.  THIS PARTICULAR AGREEMENT LINKS THE CESSATION
OF HOSTILITIES TO DEMOCRATIZATION, SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND
SELF-DETERMINATION AS A HARMONIOUS, INDIVISIBLE WHOLE.  THIS CONCEPT
IS SUPPORTED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN ITS RESOLUTION 637 OF 27
JULY 1989.  IN ADDITION, THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE MEXICAN ACCORD
READS AS FOLLOWS: THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL TALK IN
AN EFFORT TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS TO CONCLUDE
THE ARMED CONFLICT THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE.
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL FOSTER THE COUNTRY'S
DEMOCRATIZATION AND REUNITE SALVADORAN SOCIETY.  THE DIALOGUE IS MEANT
TO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON CESSATION OF
HOSTILITIES.  THE AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SIGNED IN MEXICO SAYS
NOTHING OF TALKING ABOUT OR NEGOTIATING THE FMLN'S DEMOBILIZATION BUT
MENTIONS NEGOTIATIONS TO ENCOURAGE DEMOCRATIZATION TO AGREE ON THE
CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.

   BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, CRISTIANI IS
CLOSING THE DOOR TO DEMOCRATIZATION.  THIS, PLUS HIS REFUSAL TO REACH
AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN, MAKES HIM GUILTY OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE
COMMITMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MADE AT ESQUIPULAS.

   3.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMITMENT WE MADE IN MEXICO AND WITH
THE REGIONAL ACCORDS, WE REITERATE OUR FULL WILLINGNESS TO AGREE WITH
THE GOVERNMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AND TO ATTEND
THE UPCOMING NEGOTIATION MEETING IN COSTA RICA.  FOR THIS MEETING, WE
HAVE INCLUDED IN OUR PEACE PROPOSAL AN AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE BASED
ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; CESSATION OF
REPRESSION; TRIAL OF BOTH THOSE GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR
ARNULFO ROMERO AND THOSE FOUND TO BE MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS;
ENFORCEMENT OF THE 1980 ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS; AND SUSPENSION OF
THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT EXACERBATE THE CRISIS AND THE WAR; PURGE OF
THE ARMY; CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS; HOLDING THE 1991 ELECTIONS AHEAD
OF SCHEDULE; MINIMUM OPERATIONAL GUARANTEES TO ESTABLISH GEOGRAPHICAL
AREAS FOR THE FORCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE.

   AFTER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENCE OF THE UN AND OAS SECRETARY
GENERALS' REPRESENTATIVES, WHO WILL SERVE AS WITNESSES AT THE DIALOGUE
TABLE, CRISTIANI AGREED TO INVITE THEM TO THE COSTA RICA MEETING.  WE
HOPE HE KEEPS HIS WORD BECAUSE THIS WILL LEND SERIOUSNESS TO THE
PROCESS AND GUARANTEE THE NEGOTIATIONS INITIATED IN MEXICO.

   SIGNED THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND

   BUENOS AIRES, 5 OCT 89 (DYN) -- [TEXT] POLICE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT A
BOMB EXPLODED EARLY THIS MORNING IN FRONT OF THE OFFICES THAT FORMER
PRESIDENT RAUL ALFONSIN HAS IN THIS CITY. THE EXPLOSION BROKE THE
WINDOWS OF NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS AND A WOMAN WAS WOUNDED SLIGHTLY IN
AN ARM.

   THE ATTACK OCCURRED AT 0320 [0620 GMT] IN FRONT OF THE RICARDO
ROJAS CULTURAL CENTER, LOCATED AT 132 AYACUCHO STREET, WHERE THE
FORMER PRESIDENT HAS OFFICES FOR HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. THE
EXPLOSION WOUNDED THE ARM OF BEATRIZ IERO, DAMAGED THE DOORS AND WALLS

   TRUJILLO, 9 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] A PERUVIAN DIPLOMATIC SOURCE
SAID TODAY THAT JUDGING BY PERU'S STANCE ON THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL
SITUATION IN THE ISTHMUS, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT "IS UNCOMFORTABLE"
WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR IN LIMA.

   THE SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, ALSO SAID THAT THE PRESENCE OF
PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR BERTRAN SHERR IT "CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD AS
BEING OF COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL INTEREST."

   THE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE EVENTUAL REMOVAL OF PANAMA FROM THE
GROUP OF EIGHT AND ITS REPLACEMENT BY A NEW MEMBER WILL BE DECIDED
THIS WEDNESDAY IN ICA (PERU) DURING THE SUMMIT OF THE PRESIDENTS OF
ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, PERU, URUGUAY, AND VENEZUELA.

   PANAMA'S ROLE IN THE GROUP OF EIGHT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF
THAT COUNTRY'S CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION.

   THE SAME SOURCE DISMISSED THE IDEA THAT PERU MAY BE PLANNING TO
BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH PANAMA BECAUSE THIS WOULD AFFECT
PERU'S LINKS WITH THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND "THIS IS NOT THE POSITION
OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEMBER COUNTRIES."

   PANAMA HAS HAD AN AMBASSADOR IN PERU FOR 40 YEARS, BUT ONLY FOR
"PERSONAL REASONS".

   IN THE PRIVATE DIALOGUE WITH EFE, THE SOURCE SAID THAT "THE
PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR SEEMINGLY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGES SENT
BY THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT THROUGH ITS RECENT ACTIONS."

   IN EARLY SEPTEMBER THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT REMOVED ITS AMBASSADOR
TO PANAMA, MR MARIO CASTRO ARENAS, FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD AND
DOWNGRADED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES TO THE LEVEL OF CHARGE
D'AFFAIRES.  PERU DID THIS AFTER ANNOUNCING THAT IT WOULD NOT
RECOGNIZE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT HEADED BY
FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ.

   ASKED IF THE PANAMANIAN DIPLOMAT WOULD BE INVITED TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY, THE SOURCE SAID THAT "THIS HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED BECAUSE
THAT WOULD IMPLY BREAKING RELATIONS WITH PANAMA, AND PERU DOES NOT
WANT TO GO THAT FAR."

   IN COMMENTS TO A TELEVISION REPORTER LAST SUNDAY IN LIMA, FOREIGN
MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX SAID THAT PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL
PROPOSE THE DEFINITIVE EXPULSION OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, URUGUAY, AND
PERU BEGAN A 2-DAY MEETING IN TRUJILLO TODAY AND THEIR AGENDA INCLUDES
THE SITUATION IN PANAMA, THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING,
TERRORISM, THE FOREIGN DEBT, AND THE INTEGRATION PROCESS.

   TRUJILLO, 550 KILOMETERS NORTH OF LIMA, IS NORMALLY A QUIET AREA,
BUT IT NOW GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF BEING A MILITARIZED CITY.  THIS
MILITARY PRESENCE IS AIMED AT DETERRING SABOTAGE AND ATTACKS BY
TERRORIST GROUPS.

   AT LEAST 5,000 POLICEMEN AND SOLDIERS ARE GUARDING ALL ENTRANCES TO
THE CITY.  THERE IS EVEN HEAVIER SECURITY AT THE PLAZA DE ARMAS ZONE,
WHERE THE FOREIGN MINISTERS WILL MEET.  NO VEHICLES OR PEOPLE ARE
ALLOWED IN THAT AREA.

   BOGOTA, 10 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] "THE EXTRADITABLES," THE ARMED
BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
MURDER OF TWO EMPLOYEES OF BOGOTA'S DAILY EL ESPECTADOR PERPETRATED
TODAY IN MEDELLIN, A SOURCE FROM THAT NEWSPAPER TOLD EFE.

   MIGUEL SOLER RODRIGUEZ, EL ESPECTATOR'S CIRCULATION MANAGER AND
MARTHA LUZ LOPEZ, THE CORRESPONDENT'S OFFICE ADMINISTRATOR, WERE
KILLED TODAY IN SEPARATE ATTACKS CARRIED OUT BY GUNMEN IN MEDELLIN,
COLOMBIA'S SECOND LARGEST CITY AND CAPITAL OF THE ANTIOQUIA
DEPARTMENT.

   SHORTLY AFTER THE MURDERS, AN ANONYMOUS CALL WAS RECEIVED AT EL
ESPECTADOR'S OFFICE IN MEDELLIN, THREATENING TO KILL ALL THE EDITORS
AND OFFICE PERSONNEL WHO DO NOT RESIGN IN 3 DAYS.

   "THE EXTRADITABLES," THE VOICE SAID, "DO NOT WANT THAT NEWSPAPER
CIRCULATING IN ANTIOQUIA ANYMORE."

   MARTHA LUZ LOPEZ, 35, WHO WORKED FOR EL ESPECTADOR 11 YEARS, WAS
KILLED BY TWO MEN ON MOTORCYCLES WHO INTERCEPTED HER CAR AT A CORNER
AND SHOT HER SEVERAL TIMES. AT THE MOMENT OF THE ATTACK, SHE WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY HER MOTHER MARTHA LOPEZ OROZCO DE LOPEZ, WHO WAS
WOUNDED.

   SOLER, WHO WAS 45-YEARS OLD AND HAD WORKED FOR 25 YEARS AT EL
ESPECTATOR, WAS ALSO KILLED BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHILE HE WAS
ON HIS WAY BACK TO HIS RESIDENCE.

   SOLER, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF ADVERTISING AND CIRCULATION OF EL
ESPECTADOR IN MEDELLIN AND THE NORTHWESTERN AREA OF COLOMBIA, WAS
MARRIED AND THE FATHER OF THREE CHILDREN.

   THE MAIN OFFICES IN BOGOTA OF EL ESPECTADOR, THE NEWSPAPER MOST
THREATENED BY COLOMBIA'S DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA, WERE PARTIALLY
DESTROYED ON 2 SEPTEMBER WHEN A CAR BOMB EXPLOSION INJURED OVER 90
PEOPLE.

   NEWSPAPER DIRECTOR GUILLERMO CANO WAS MURDERED AS HE WAS LEAVING
HIS OFFICE ON 17 DECEMBER 1986. THIS CRIME WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL, WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE CALI CARTEL, IS CONSIDERED TO
BE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD INVOLVED IN THE
TRAFFICKING AND DISTRIBUTION OF COCAINE.

   NEWSPAPER ATTORNEY AND JOURNALIST HECTOR GIRALDO GALVEZ, WHO WAS
THE CIVIL PROSECUTOR IN THE INVESTIGATION INTO GUILLERMO CANO'S
HOMICIDE, WAS ALSO MURDERED IN BOGOTA ON 29 MARCH.

   EL ESPECTADOR HAS CHARACTERIZED ITSELF BY REJECTING AND CONDEMNING
DRUG TRAFFICKING AND OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES INVOLVING MAFIOSOS.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 12 OCT 89 (MOSCOW) -- [REPORT] [UNIDENTIFIED
ANNOUNCER FROM SANTIAGO] [TEXT] THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE
CHILEAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.  ONE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE
COMBINING OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH THE JUST ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND
SOCIAL DEMANDS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT
HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THESE 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.  THESE DEMANDS
ARE RELATED TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION, THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN
RIGHTS, THE DENUNCIATION OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, AND
EFFORTS TO FIGHT IMMUNITY AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TRUTH REGARDING
TORTURE, DISAPPEARANCES, AND ASSASSINATIONS. THESE QUESTIONS HAVE ONCE
AGAIN COME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT NOW THAT MANY RIGHTIST CANDIDATES ARE
DEMAGOGICALLY ATTEMPTING TO POSE AS DEFENDERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND
SINCE EL MERCURIO HAS REPORTED THAT THE DICTATOR IS PLANNING TO
CONVERT THE CNI [NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER] INTO AN AGENCY OF THE
ARMY SO THAT THE MAIN REPRESSIVE BODY FROM ALL THESE YEARS CAN BE
UNDER HIS DIRECT CONTROL.  JAIME INZUNZA, LEADER OF THE UNITED LEFT
AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE, DISCUSSES THESE TOPICS OVER A DIRECT
PHONE LINE FROM SANTIAGO, CHILE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ANNOUNCER] HOW ARE THE CHILEAN PEOPLE'S DEMANDS
CONNECTED TO THE ONGOING ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN?

   [INZUNZA] THEY ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD BOARDS DURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS; THE STRENGTHENING OF
THE UNIFIED ACTIONS OF WORKERS; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEES FOR
VICTORY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE COMMITTEES FOR THE DEFENSE OF VICTORY AND
COMMITTEES FOR CARRYING ON THE DEMOCRATIC TASK; THE DEVELOPMENT OF
CONFIDENCE; THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING
TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND IMMUNITY FOR CRIMES; THE INCREASING PRESSURE BY
THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL
POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND NATURALLY FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI.
ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN,
AND AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED WITHIN SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THIS
WAS EVIDENCED A WEEK AGO BY THE SALVADORA STRIKE AND BY THE CURRENT
STRIKE BY COAL MINERS.  THIS PROVES THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE UNDERSTOOD
THAT THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR
ACTIVITIES AND A WAY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE
FUTURE STRUGGLE. [END RECORDING]

   THE PRECEDING COMMENTS WERE MADE BY COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE LEADER
JAIME INZUNZA, WHO HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED OVER THE TELEPHONE ON OUR
PROGRAM "ESCUCHA CHILE."  ANOTHER TOPIC DISCUSSED BY INZUNZA WAS THE
EL MERCURIO REPORT ON THE CNI'S TRANSFER TO THE ARMY.  THE DISSOLUTION
OF THE CNI HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE IMMENSE
MAJORITY OF CHILEANS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ANNOUNCER] WHAT IS YOUR OPINION, JAIME INZUNZA,
ON THE DICTATOR'S INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THE CNI AS IT IS AND TO KEEP
IT UNDER HIS DIRECT COMMAND?

   [INZUNZA] I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS.  THE
INTENTION IS TO MAINTAIN INTACT THE MAIN TERRORIST APPARATUS OF THE
DICTATORSHIP, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST FLAGRANT
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE.  I
UNDERSTAND THAT THE DINA [NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, REPLACED
BY CNI] AND THE CNI HAVE BEEN IN FACT A SINGLE APPARATUS AND THEREFORE
THE MAIN ORGANS OF STATE TERRORRISM OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS.  IF
TRANSFERRED TO THE ARMY, THE CNI WOULD CONTINUE TO BE UNDER PINOCHET'S
ORDERS.  UNDER WHOSE ORDERS HAS IT BEEN ALL THESE YEARS?  FOR WHOM HAS
IT BEEN A DIRECT AGENT ALL THESE YEARS?  HENCEFORTH IT WILL BE UNDER
THE CONTROL OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY. [END
RECORDING]

   COMMUNIST LEADER JAIME INZUNZA ADDED THAT PINOCHET'S INTENT IN
TRANSFERRING THE CNI TO THE ARMY'S DIRECT COMMAND IS TO MAKE THE
INSTITUTION AN ACCOMPLICE IN CONCEALING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [INZUNZA] THE IDEA IS TO INVOLVE THE MILITARY
INSTITUTION IN CRIMES FOR WHICH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE KNOWS IT WAS NOT
RESPONSIBLE.  THIS IS CLEAR: WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION FORCES
WANT IS TO HAVE THE CULPRITS BEHIND THOSE CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS PROSECUTED, NOT THE MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE TRANSFER OF
THE CNI TO THE ARMY IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MEN IN UNIFORM ACT AS
ACCOMPLICES OR ACCESSORIES TO THOSE CRIMES.  LOYALTY IS NOT AT STAKE
HERE; LOYALTY IS DEFENDING VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, NOT SOME SORT OF
CRIMINAL COMPLICITY THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE TRAINING OF THESE
MEN.  THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE PARTICULARLY SERIOUS BECAUSE THIS
TRANSFER IMPLIES MAINTAINING THE CNI UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE MAN
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED ALL THESE YEARS, THE DICTATOR
HIMSELF. [END RECORDING]

   THESE HAVE BEEN ANSWERS GIVEN BY JAIME INZUNZA, UNITED LEFT AND
COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE LEADER, TO QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM OVER THE
PHONE BY "ESCUCHA CHILE," A RADIO MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 3 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALAN
ARCHBISHOP PROSPERO PENADOS DEL BARRIO TODAY REPORTED THE KIDNAPPING
OF A NUN, DIANA MACK ORTIZ, 20 YEARS OLD, BORN IN THE STATE OF
COLORADO IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

   THE ARCHBISHOP ALSO REPORTED THAT ANOTHER U.S. NUN, PATRICIA DENNY,
LEFT GUATEMALA 17 DAYS AGO BECAUSE OF CONTINUOUS DEATH THREATS OVER
THE TELEPHONE AND IN WRITING.

   PENADOS SAID DIANA MACK ORTIZ WAS KIDNAPPED ON 2 NOVEMBER IN
ANTIGUA GUATEMALA, 45 KM SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, WHEN SHE WAS
ATTENDING A SEMINAR ALONG WITH OTHER NUNS.  THE ARCHBISHOP EXPLAINED
THE NUN HAD BEEN RECEIVING DEATH THREATS.  SHE HAD BEEN URGED TO LEAVE
GUATEMALA, BUT SHE DECIDED TO CONTINUE WORKING IN THIS COUNTRY.

   THE KIDNAPPED NUN, WHO HAD BEEN IN GUATEMALA FOR A YEAR, WAS
TEACHING AT THE SAN MIGUEL ACATAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN HUEHUETENANGO
DEPARTMENT IN NORTHEAST GUATEMALA.  SHE BELONGS TO THE ORDER OF THE
URSILINA, PENADOS REPORTED.

   PATRICIA DENNY, 54, LEFT GUATEMALA AFTER UNIDENTIFIED MEN WARNED
HER THAT IF SHE WISHED TO CONTINUE LIVING SHE HAD TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.  DENNY HAD ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA IN 1984, BELONGED TO THE
SISTERS OF MARY KNOLL, AND WAS WORKING AT A PARISH IN MIXCO
MUNICIPALITY IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY.

   THE ARCHBISHOP SAID ALL THIS IS THE "BEGINNING OF A CAMPAIGN TO
INTIMIDATE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH."  HE DID NOT MENTION WHICH GROUPS ARE
PERPETRATING THESE INTIMIDATION ACTIONS.  HOWEVER, PENADOS SAID HE IS
GOING TO TALK TO GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TODAY TO REPORT
THE INCIDENTS WITH THE U.S. NUNS.

   PENADOS STATED THAT THIS KIND OF ACTION "HARMED CATHOLICISM VERY
MUCH IN PAST YEARS," WHEN REPRESSION SEVERELY HIT THIS SECTOR.  HE
POINTED OUT THAT THIS KIND OF INCIDENT HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE
PRESIDENT CEREZO TOOK OVER POWER IN GUATEMALA ON 14 JANUARY 1986.

   THE ARCHBISHOP DEMANDED THAT MACK ORTIZ' KIDNAPPERS RESPECT HER
LIFE AND PHYSICAL INTEGRITY.

THE GOVERNMENTS OF CHILE AND EL SALVADOR HAVE SIGNED A JOINT
DECLARATION IN WHICH THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE MARKET ECONOMY PRINCIPLES
ARE THE MAIN FORCE OF DEVELOPMENT.

   THE DECLARATION WAS SIGNED BY FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE
ERRAZURIZ AND BY SALVADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER MANUEL PACAS, WHO TODAY
CONCLUDED AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO CHILE. THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE REASSERTS
BOTH COUNTRIES' COMMITMENT TO THE GROWING LIBERATION OF INTERNATIONAL
TRADE AND IT REJECTS THE OBSTACLES THAT HINDER EXCHANGE. THE DOCUMENT
LIKEWISE EXPRESSES THE CONCERN OF CHILE AND EL SALVADOR OVER TERRORIST
ACITIVITY IN LATIN AMERICA AND FOREIGN SUPPORT TO SUBVERSIVE GROUPS.
THE TWO COUNTRIES AGREE THAT BOTH ACTIVITIES HINDER DEMOCRACY AND
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

   AFTER SIGNING THE JOINT DECLARATION, THE SALVADORAN FOREIGN
MINISTER GAVE A NEWS CONFERENCE IN WHICH HE REGRETTED THE FACT THAT
THE GUERRILLA ABANDONED THE TALKS SPONSORED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.
PACAS SAID THAT THIS ATTITUDE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE EXTREMISTS DO NOT
WANT PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.

PROVINCES AND EXTENDED THE MEASURE IN ANOTHER FIVE.  THIS MEANS ALL OF
LIMA DEPARTMENT, WITH A POPULATION OF OVER 6 MILLION PEOPLE, IS UNDER
A STATE OF EMERGENCY.

   THIS GOVERNMENT DECISION IS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN
THE PROVINCES AND AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THE BOYCOTT OF THE ELECTION
WHICH WAS DECREED BY THE MAOIST "SHINING PATH" ORGANIZATION.

   LIMA DEPARTMENT IS THE LARGEST PERUVIAN DEPARTMENT IN BOTH
POPULATION AND ELECTORAL STRENGTH.  IT IS MADE UP OF 10 PROVINCES,
INCLUDING LIMA PROVINCE, WHICH CONTAINS 90 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION,
AND THE CALLAO PORT, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVINCE.

   ACCORDING TO THE DECREES PUBLISHED TODAY, THE GOVERNMENT IS
ESTABLISHING A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE PROVINCES OF [WORDS
INDISTINCT] AND CANETE, WHILE THE EMERGENCY IN EFFECT IN BARRANCA,
CAJATAMBO, HUAURA, YAUYOS, AND OYON WILL BE EXTENDED ANOTHER 30 DAYS.

HANDAL, WHO IS TALKING ABOUT COL PONCE AND CRISTIANI'S RESPONSIBILITY
IN THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON FENASTRAS.  THIS INCIDENT PROMPTED A VISIT
TO OUR COUNTRY BY U.S. OFFICIAL BERNARD ARONSON.  LET US HEAR WHAT
COMMANDER HANDAL HAS TO SAY ABOUT THE U.S.  OFFICIAL'S VISIT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HANDAL] OF COURSE, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT
WANT TO APPEAR AS IF IT WERE WITHDRAWING SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI.  WE WERE JUST SAYING THAT ARONSON HAD ARRIVED AND HE LOOKED
WORRIED.  THE NICE LOOKING GLASS HOUSE THEY HAD BUILT HAS RAPIDLY
BEGUN TO FALL APART.  ARONSON APPARENTLY CAME TO SEE HOW HE COULD
PATCH THINGS UP.  WE RECALL A SIMILAR HIGH-LEVEL VISIT BACK AROUND
1984, IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT, WHEN THE CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENT
ARRIVED.  AT THAT TIME HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT UNDER THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, NO, THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, AND CAME TO SEE HOW TO
IMPROVE THE SUPPOSEDLY CENTRIST GOVERNMENT AND HOW TO PUT AN END TO
THE DEATH SQUADS.  HE TOOK A LIST BACK WITH HIM...[CHANGES THOUGHT]
LET US TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEY OPERATE.  WHEN THEY TAKE ANY ACTION
THEY ARE VERY CLEAR AND DIRECT.  THEY HAD A POLITICAL INTEREST IN
PUTTING ALL THIS TOGETHER, SO BUSH TOOK BACK WITH HIM A LIST OF 15
MILITARY MEMBERS SO THEY COULD BE FIRED. [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT] [COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF OF THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PEOPLE: GOOD MORNING.  I AM
SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES THAT IS ON ITS FEET
AT 0115 ON 12 NOVEMBER, CONFRONTING A TREACHEROUS ATTACK BY THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS WHO AT 2000 ON
11 NOVEMBER--DISPLAYING THEIR WARMONGERING STRATEGY AND WITHOUT CARING
ABOUT THE SUFFERING OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE--CARRIED OUT TREACHEROUS
ACTIONS IN WHICH THE CIVILIAN POPULATION WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE
SUFFERED.

   THE MILITARY AND PUBLIC SECURITY PERSONNEL HAVE REACTED IN AN
EFFICIENT MANNER IN REJECTING THE TERRORIST ENEMY. WE ARE OBLIGATED TO
REPORT TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THE MOST IMPORTANT
ACTIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER ARE AS
FOLLOWS: AN ATTACK ON THE RESIDENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
PRESIDENT, WHO IS UNHARMED; AND AN ATTACK ON THE CENTRAL ELECTIONS
COUNCIL WHERE NO MATERIAL DAMAGE OR CASUALTIES OCCURRED.  LIKEWISE,
THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE WHICH CAUSED SLIGHT
MATERIAL DAMAGE AND NO CASUALTIES. FORTUNATELY FOR ALL SALVADORANS,
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC IS UNDER FULL PROTECTION AND HE WAS
NEVER IN ANY DANGER. LIKEWISE, WE REPORT THAT THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON
HIS PRIVATE RESIDENCE.

   WE ALSO WANT TO REPORT TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT SOME MILITARY
PERSONNEL WERE HARASSED, SUCH AS THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, THE
NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON IN THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE 6TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE IN USULUTAN CITY WHERE ONE MINOR WAS INJURED.  THERE
WAS ALSO HARASSMENT OF THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE WITH HEADQUARTERS IN
SAN MIGUEL. THERE WAS NO MATERIAL DAMAGE AND THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS ASSURED TODAY THEY HAVE "CONSOLIDATED" FOUR OF THE MOST
DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR WHERE SOME
300,000 PERSONS LIVE.

   COMMANDER AMILCAR, ONE OF THE REBEL CHIEFS WHO HAS OCCUPIED THE
ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT HE AND HIS MEN CAME TO SAN
SALVADOR "PREPARED, AND WITH SUFFICIENT AMMUNITION TO REMAIN FOR
SEVERAL DAYS."

   IN A GENERAL ASSESEMENT OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, THE YOUNG
COMMANDER SAID THAT THE ARMY "CANNOT ENTER" THE "AREA UNDER REBEL
CONTROL," BUT IT IS ATTACKING THE REBELS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE
HEADQUARTERS AND USING HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS.

   "HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE HAVE THE TRUMP CARD (FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE
OFFENSIVE)," HE ADDED.

   AMILCAR, WHO IS 26-YEARS-AGO AND LOOKS LIKE A STUDENT, WAS WALKING
DOWN THE HALLWAYS OF ONE OF THE CRAMPED FIVE-STORY APARTMENT BUILDINGS
IN ZACAMIL WHILE EXPLAINING THAT THE GOAL OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE IS
"TO SEEK OPTIONS FOR BUILDING PEACE IN EL SALVADOR."

   HE ADDED THAT THE GUERRILLAS SEEK "TO DISRUPT THE DIALOGUE
CONDITIONS, AND GO TO THE CONVERSATIONS WITH A POLITICAL AND MILITARY
ADVANTAGE SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL AGREE WITH US ON WHAT THE PEOPLE
WANT: DEMOCRACY, A PEOPLE'S ECONOMIC POLICY, AND A PURGE IN THE ARMED
FORCES, AMONG OTHER THINGS."

   THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR HAVE HELD TWO
MEETINGS IN RECENT MONTHS, THE FIRST ONE IN MEXICO AND THE SECOND ONE
IN COSTA RICA.  A THIRD MEETING WAS TO BE HELD SHORTLY IN VENEZUELA,
BUT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ANNOUNCED
THAT IT WILL NOT ATTEND.

   THE FMLN LAUNCHED THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY OFFENSIVE SINCE 1981
ON 11 NOVEMBER, ATTACKING 50 MILITARY POSITIONS, 20 OF THEM IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS, THE OFFENSIVE HAS CAUSED NEARLY 300
CASUALTIES (127 DEAD AND 155 WOUNDED) ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, AND OVER
400 CASUALTIES ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS.

   THE OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN NAMED "OUT WITH THE FASCISTS! FEBE ELIZABETH
LIVES!" IN HOMAGE TO A TRADE UNION LEADER KILLED 13 DAYS AGO ALONG
WITH NINE OTHER WORKERS IN A DYNAMITE EXPLOSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY
ATTRIBUTED TO THE ULTRARIGHTIST DEATH SQUADS.

   ARMED WITH AN AUTOMATIC AK-47 RIFLE, AMILCAR SAID THAT THE FMLN
"HAS CONSOLIDATED THE ZACAMIL, CUSCATANCINGO, MEJICANOS, AND PANAMA
NEIGHBORHOODS, AND WE HAVE BESIEGED THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE."

   ALL THE PLACES HE MENTIONED ARE IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE
BLOODIEST CLASHES BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS
HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

   AT NIGHTFALL ON 12 NOVEMBER AND PRIOR TO THE CURFEW THAT BEGINS AT
2000 (0200 GMT), THE RESIDENTS OF ZACAMIL WERE OUTSIDE THEIR BUILDINGS
CARRYING CANDLES AS THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY.

   AMILCAR ASSURED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE INFLICTED AT LEAST 18
CASUALTIES ON THE ARMED FORCES IN THAT AREA AND HAVE SEIZED ABOUT 20
RIFLES AND 1 M-60 MACHINEGUN.

   "THIS OFFENSIVE IS A MILITARY AND POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENT. AS A
RESULT OF THE CLOSING OF THE COMALAPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, THE MAIN
AIRPORT OF THE COUNTRY, WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN LETTING THE WORLD THAT WE
ARE AT WAR AND ARE AN EMERGING POWER," THE REBEL COMMANDER SAID.

   COMALAPA AIRPORT, LOCATED 50 KM SOUTH OF SAN SALVADOR, WAS CLOSED
"FOR SECURITY REASONS."

   ACORDING TO THE FMLN CLANDESTINE STATION, RADIO VENCEREMOS, THE
GUERRILLA FIGHTERS DESTROYED THREE MILITARY HELICOPTERS ON THE GROUND
AND CAUSED SOME DAMAGE ON THE AIRPORTS'S MAIN LANDING STRIP.

   REFERRING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO IMPOSE A CURFEW AND A
NATIONWIDE STATE OF SIEGE EFFECTIVE TONIGHT, COMMANDER AMILCAR SAID:
"WE HAD ALREADY TAKEN THIS INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE
OFFENSIVE."

   THE GOVERNMENT "CANNOT ACT INDISCRIMINATELY AGAINST THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION," AMILCAR SAID; ADDING THAT "THE CITIZENS' RIGHTS WERE
SUSPENDED TO BOMB THE PLACES TAKEN OVER BY OUR FORCES."

   THE PEOPLE OF ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS LOCATED NORTH OF THE
CAPITAL HAVE LIVED IN TERROR SINCE SATURDAY, 11 NOVEMBER, WHEN THEY
WERE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE BETWEEN THE REBELS AND THE MILITARY,
SUBJECTED TO THE AIR RAIDS AND THE THREAT THAT LIVING WITH THE
GUERRILLA MEMBERS REPRESENTS TO THEM.

   AT LEAST TWO CIVILIANS HAVE DIED IN ZACAMIL AND FIVE MORE HAVE BEEN
WOUNDED, INCLUDING TWO CHILDREN, AS A RESULT OF THE ARMED CLASHES.

NOVEMBER, AN ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER WAS DESTROYED WITH AN RPG-7
ROCKET [WORDS INDISTINCT].  FOUR ENEMY CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED.  WE
REPEAT: AN ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER WAS DESTROYED BY OUR FIGHTERS IN
SAN MIGUEL.  OUR FIGHTERS USED AN RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHER TO DESTROY THE
ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER.

   NOW WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION FROM SAN SALVADOR.  AT 0800 1400 GMT THIS
MORNING, A C-47 PLANE FLEW OVER AND STRAFED THE MEJICANOS DOWNTOWN AREA,
WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE.  ACCORDING TO THE REPORT WE RECEIVED, MANY
CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN INJURED.  WE WERE ALSO ADVISED THAT THE C-47 LEFT THE
AREA AFTER ITS ATTACK.

   WE ONCE AGAIN CALL ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PRESSURE ALFREDO
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT TO STOP THIS KIND OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION.  THESE
ACTIONS ARE DIRECTED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THE ARMED FORCES
HAS BEEN SHELLING AND STRAFING DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR
SINCE SATURDAY.  IN THE PAST WE HAVE DENOUNCED INDISCRIMINATE SHELLING OF
RURAL AREAS; HOWEVER, THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED ATTACKS.  THIS SHELLING AND
BOMBING HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN MANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] A HIGH-RANKING UNITED
NATIONS OFFICIAL IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY VOICED DISAPPROVAL REGARDING THE
SUPPORT EXPRESSED BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA FOR THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).

   "NICARAGUA'S SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN IS AN INSULT TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PEACE PROCESS," SAID THE UNITED NATIONS OFFICIAL WHO WISHED TO REMAIN
ANONYMOUS.  HE IS PARTICIPATING IN THE UNITED NATIONS PEACE EFFORTS IN THE
AREA.

   THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN ON 11 NOVEMBER, THE MOST IMPORTANT
ONE SINCE 1981, HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN 139 DEAD AND 313 WOUNDED,
INCLUDING SOLDIERS, REBELS, AND CIVILIANS, GOVERNMENT SOURCES REPORTED
TODAY.

   ORTEGA, ON 11 NOVEMBER, DESCRIBED THE ARMY'S ACTIONS AS A "GENOCIDE"
AND A "MASSACRE," REFERRING TO THE BOMBINGS OF NEIGHBORHOODS OCCUPIED BY
THE GUERRILLAS.

   ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL, THE OPEN SUPPORT VOICED BY ORTEGA TO THE
SALVADORAN REBELS "IS A MISTAKE AND AN INTERVENTION."  

   THE UN OFFICIAL EMPHASIZED THAT "THIS GIVES THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AN
INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION AND THE UNITED STATES HAS SAID THAT IS HAS NOT
RULED OUT AN INTERVENTION IN THE AREA DUE TO THE NICARAGUAN SUPPORT TO THE
MARXIST GUERRILLA OF EL SALVADOR."  

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OF RIGHTIST ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS BLAMED
ORTEGA FOR VIOLATING THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENTS BY GIVING MORAL
AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE FMLN.

   ON 12 NOVEMBER, CRISTIANI ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN
PRESIDENT ORTEGA'S POSITION.

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] TODAY, 14 NOVEMBER,
NEW ATTACKS ARE TAKING PLACE AGAINST POSITIONS OF THE JOINT STAFF OF THE
ARMED FORCES.  THE PINK ZONE [LA ZONA ROSA] IS TURNING BLACK FOR THE ENEMY.
OUR FORCES ARE CLASHING WITH THE ZACAMIL BATTALION.

   WE HAVE A REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL SAYING THAT THIS AFTERNOON,
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] FORCES WERE STRONGLY
ATTACKING ZACAMIL BATTALION TROOPS.  THE FMLN TROOPS ARE HARASSING THE
JOINT STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES AT THIS TIME.  BARRICADES ARE BEING
SET UP THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL ON THIS 4TH DAY OF FIGHTING.

   THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK ON THE JOINT STAFF IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS
BECAUSE, AS WE SAID LAST NIGHT, FMLN TROOPS INITIATED ATTACKS AGAINST
THE SAN BENITO BATTALION AT THE INTERNATIONAL FAIR AND AGAINST THE
FORCES DEFENDING THE JOINT STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES.

   THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK AGAINST THE JOINT STAFF, WHICH
COMPLICATES THE OVERALL SITUATION FOR THE ARMED FORCES IN THE CAPITAL.
WE ARE ATTACKING THE TOP COMMAND OF THE ENEMY FORCES.  FMLN FORCES ARE
ATTACKING THE HEART AND THE BRAIN OF THE ENEMY.

   SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES ARE OVERFLYING AREAS NORTH OF THE
CAPITAL, AND THEY CONTINUE MACHINEGUNNING AND BOMBING CIVILIAN AREAS.
A FEW MINUTES AGO, WE REPORTED HEAVY BOMBING IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.

   LA PAZ, 15 NOV 89 (LA RED PANAMERICANA) -- [EXCERPT] EARLY THIS
MORNING THE GOVERNMENT DECREED A STATE OF SIEGE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
TO END THE SOCIAL CRISIS AND TO PROTECT THE INTERNAL ORDER, WHICH HAS
BEEN DISRUPTED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. THIS REPORT IS INCLUDED IN A
GOVERNMENT DECREE APPROVED BY PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA.

   ACCORDING TO INTERIOR MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY RAUL LOAYZA, POLICE
ARRESTED 500 TEACHERS AND EDUCATION LEADERS IN THE NINE DEPARTMENTAL
CAPITALS, THUS THWARTING THE EXTENDED HUNGER STRIKE.

   THE STRIKE BY TEACHERS, WHO HAVE BEEN DEMANDING A BONUS OF 300
BOLIVIAN PESOS, HAS UNLEASHED VIOLENT STREET CONFRONTATIONS OVER THE
PAST FEW DAYS AND AT LEAST FOUR BOMBINGS.

   THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN BESIEGED BY A WAVE OF SOCIAL DEMANDS
AND PRESSURED BY THE 80,000 TEACHERS, HAS STATED THAT THESE
DEMONSTRATIONS ARE UNDERMINING DEMOCRATIC STABILITY. IT ADDED THAT
DESPITE EFFORTS TO FIND A PATH TO PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE AND DIALOGUE,
IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO PREVENT RADICAL GROUPS INTERESTED IN THE
UNION LEADERSHIP FROM PUBLICLY CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT.

   THE GOVERNMENT DECREE STATES THAT IT WILL GUARANTEE THE 3 DECEMBER
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AND PROTECT THE CITIZENS' RIGHT TO VOTE.

   A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THIS DECREE TO THE PRESS,
POLICE PATROLS RAIDED THE CENTERS WHERE THE HUNGER STRIKES WERE TAKING
PLACE.  POLICE USED EXCESSIVE FORCE IN THESE RAIDS.

   THE 250 STRIKERS ARRESTED IN LA PAZ WERE TAKEN IN TRUCKS AND BUSES
OF THE POLICE, THE AIR FORCE, AND OTHER STATE INSTITUTIONS, TO THE EL
ELTO AIR BASE.

   THE GOVERNMENT REPORTED THAT 250 STRIKERS WERE ALSO ARRESTED IN THE
INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY. IT ADDED THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
STRIKE WILL BE SENT TO DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. OTHER, LESS
RESPONSIBLE GROUPS OF STRIKERS WILL BE TRIED BY THE REGULAR COURTS.
OTHERS WILL BE RELEASED.

   THE THREE LA PAZ TEACHERS' LEADERS HAVE BEEN SENT TO DIFFERENT
HOSPITALS IN LA PAZ AND PLACED IN INTENSIVE CARE. THEY ARE MIGUEL
LORA, TELMO ROMAN, AND LUIS ALVAREZ, WHO ARE NOT FACING ANY RISK OF
DEATH, THE INTERIOR MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY STATED.  HE WARNED THAT
THE BOLIVIAN LABOR CONFEDERATION UNDERGROUND SESSIONS WILL BE ILLEGAL,
AND THEY ARE NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, HE
SAID.

   THIS IS THE FIRST SOCIAL CRISIS PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA HAS HAD TO
FACE SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ALMOST 100 DAYS AGO.

   CLANDESTINE, 16 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [HUMAN
RIGHTS PROMOTION AND PROTECTION SECRETARIAT OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROMOTION AND
PROTECTION SECRETARIAT [SECRETARIA DE PROMOCION Y PROTECCION DE LOS
DERECHOS HUMANOS] OF THE FMLN STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE MASSACRE OF FIVE
SPANISH-BORN JESUIT PRIESTS AND THREE SALVADORAN CITIZENS CARRIED OUT
BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS.  IGNORING A MARTIAL LAW
PROHIBITING ALL TRAVEL, EARLY THIS MORNING A LARGE NUMBER OF HEAVILY
ARMED SOLDIERS BURST INTO THE RESIDENCE OF THE PRIESTS WHO MANAGE THE
JOSE SIMEON CANAS CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY [UCA].  THE SOLDIERS BROKE INTO
THE PRIESTS' BEDROOMS, CAPTURED THEM, AND BRUTALLY MURDERED THEM IN
THE GARDEN.

   THE VICTIMS OF THIS HATEFUL COLLECTIVE CRIME WERE: PRIEST AND DR
IGNACIO ELLACURIA, THE UCA DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR IGNACIO MARTIN
BARO, UCA DEPUTY DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR SEGUNDO MONTES, UCA HUMAN
RIGHTS INSTITUTE DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR AMANDO LOPEZ, UCA DEAN;
PRIEST JUAN RAMON MORENO; AND JOAQUIN LOPEZ Y LOPEZ, AS WELL AS JULIA
RAMOS AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, ELVA RAMOS.

   THE PERSONS WHO ORDERED THE HORRIBLE MURDER OF THE JESUITS AND
THREE SALVADORAN CITIZENS ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ORDERED PILOTS,
ARTILLERY MEN, AND MACHINEGUNNERS IN PLANES TO ATTACK THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.  THEY ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE AGAINST REACHING A
POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  THEY ARE THE TOP
MILITARY AND POLITICAL FIGURES IN ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION.

   THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROMOTION AND PROTECTION SECRETARIAT CALLS ON THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO TIE THE HANDS OF THESE MURDERERS OF
SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND TO AID IN FINDING A SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL
CRISIS SO WE MAY ATTAIN A JUST AND LASTING PEACE OUR PEOPLE SO DESIRE.

   NO MORE BARBARIC ACTIONS IN SAN SALVADOR.  NO MORE INJUSTICES.
TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT FOR THE MURDERERS.  THE MILITARY AND POLITICAL
LEADERS OF CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT MUST BE OUSTED.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 14 NOV 89 (IZVESTIYA) -- [TEXT] FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] DETACHMENTS HAVE CONDUCTED THE LARGEST MILITARY
OPERATION IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY'S
CAPITAL.

   AN OFFENSIVE WAS LAUNCHED SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY'S
TERRITORY; HOWEVER, SAN SALVADOR'S CITY BLOCKS, WHICH WERE THE SCENE
OF FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN FMLN DETACHMENTS AND GOVERNMENT TROOPS,
WERE THE EPICENTER OF SUNDAY'S EVENTS.  THE INTENSE FIREFIGHT
INVOLVING ARTILLERY AND HELICOPTERS LASTED APPROXIMATELY 18 HOURS AND
ENCOMPASSED VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE CAPITAL, COMPLETELY PARALYZING LIFE
IN THE CITY.  ACCORDING TO REUTER, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO STORM
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S OFFICIAL AND PERSONAL RESIDENCES;
HOWEVER, IT IS REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT HURT.

   REPORTS OF THE LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES ARE CONTRADICTORY.

   A STATE OF SIEGE HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN EL SALVADOR AND
CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED.  A CURFEW IS IN FORCE
IN THE CAPITAL, AND THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT HAS BEEN CLOSED.
ACCORDING TO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHOSE SPEECH WAS BROADCAST ON THE
RADIO, THESE STEPS ARE NEEDED TO "DEFEND THE POPULATION AGAINST
LEFT-WING TERRORISM."  ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT, THE MILITARY ARE IN
COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION; HOWEVER, IT IS REPORTED FROM SAN
SALVADOR THAT THESE WORDS BY A.  CRISTIANI WERE HEARD ON THE AIRWAVES
ACCOMPANIED BY CONTINUAL EXPLOSIONS AND SHOOTING.

   INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS REGARD EVENTS IN SAN SALVADOR IN THE
CONTEXT OF THE INTERRUPTED TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
INSURGENTS.  THE THIRD ROUND OF THESE TALKS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELD
RECENTLY IN CARACAS, BUT OPPOSITION REPRESENTATIVES REFUSED TO TAKE
PART IN THEM AFTER A LEFT-WING TRADE UNION'S HEADQUARTERS WAS
SUBJECTED TO ARTILLERY BOMBARDMENT RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST
10 PEOPLE.  ACCORDING TO THE INSURGENTS, THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED ON
DIALOGUE WITH THEM SOLELY OUT OF PROPAGANDA CONSIDERATIONS, WITH NO
INTENTION OF REACHING ANY AGREEMENT.  SUNDAY'S OFFENSIVE WAS THUS AN
ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART TO SHOW THEMSELVES TO BE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED
WITH.

   IN THE OPINION OF OBSERVERS, HOWEVER, EVENTS IN SAN SALVADOR
PRACTICALLY RULE OUT ALL HOPES OF SUCCESS FOR FUTURE TALKS BETWEEN THE
GOVERNMENT AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INSURGENTS.  MOREOVER, THE
FIGHTING IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, A REUTER CORRESPONDENT BELIEVES,
DEALT THE FRAGILE PEACE SETTLEMENT PROCESS IN CENTRAL AMERICA A
CONSIDERABLE BLOW.

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CRISTIANI] [CONTINUED]
THAT IS THE POSITION OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  WITH THE
INFORMATION IT HAS, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT POINT THE FINGER AT ANYONE.
IT CANNOT ACCUSE ANYONE YET, BECAUSE THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE
IN THIS CASE.  WE BELIEVE THERE MAY BE SOME PEOPLE WHO CAN COOPERATE
WITH US IF WE HELP THEM.  THERE MAY BE SOME WITNESSES, WHO MAY BE
WILLING TO COOPERATE, BUT THEY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] HE SAID HE WAS WILLING TO HELP.  THEY WANTED THE
INVESTIGATIONS TO TAKE PLACE.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I BELIEVE MUCH DEPENDS ON THE POSITION OF THE
FMLN.  I HAVE LISTENED TO SEVERAL VERSIONS ALL THE WAY FROM DEMANDING
MY RESIGNATION TO ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS AGAINST ME TO FINISH
EVERYTHING UP.  UNDER THESE TERMS, THEY ARE SAYING WE ARE ABOUT TO
CREATE A NEW LEBANON, AND THEY ARE SAYING THE FMLN HAS CONTROL OVER
CERTAIN LIBERATED AREAS IN THE CAPITAL.  HOWEVER, IF WE TALKED ABOUT
THE SITUATION RATIONALLY AND REASONABLY, THERE COULD BE [WORD
INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE AIR FORCE SITUATION IN
THE PAST.  THE AIR FORCE HAS ORDERS NOT TO BOMB AND NOT TO USE ITS
WEAPONS AGAINST URBAN AREAS OF THE CAPITAL UNLESS IT HAS BEEN ABLE TO
DETECT AND ISOLATE A CLEAR FMLN TARGET.  IN THIS REGARD, AIR FORCE
BOMBS WERE NOT USED UNTIL LAST NIGHT WHEN AIR FORCE PLANES WERE
ATTACKED FROM SOME SUGARCANE FIELDS NORTH OF THE 1533 LANDING STRIP
[16-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION]...USE BOMBS TO STOP THE USE OF FMLN
MORTARS.  THE AIR FORCE USED MACHINEGUNS [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ONLY
TIME THEY WERE USED WITHIN THE URBAN AREA, TO BE SURE THEY WERE NOT
ENDANGERING ANYONE, WERE TWO MORTARS INSTALLED IN THE SOCCER FIELD OF
THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] ONE WAS FIRED AT THE
POLICE BATTALION IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE OTHER WAS FIRING AT
THE 1ST BRIGADE.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] I BELIEVE THAT AMONG THE WEAPONS
THAT WERE SEIZED, THERE ARE SOME OF THAT.  I AM NOT TOO SURE.

   IN THE [WORDS INDISTINCT], NEAR THE SAN JACINTO HILL WERE USED TO
SUPPORT TROOPS THAT WERE USING THE SAN JACINTO HILL.  WE BELIEVE IT
WAS THE FMLN WITHRAWING [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN SANTA MARTA. UP TO NOW,
THE POSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES STAFF AND THE HIGH COMMAND IN THE USE
OF THE AIR FORCE IS ONLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND WHEN SPECIFIC TARGETS
CAN BE ISOLATED IN WHICH THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IS NOT ENDANGERED.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] A FASCIST
IDEOLOGY HAS INFILTRATED THE WHITE HOUSE AND NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED
BECAUSE IT COINCIDES WITH THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]
IDEOLOGY.  THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE BOMBINGS AFTER
CYNICALLY SAYING IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEM.  HOWEVER, THAT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
IS EVEN MORE HAIR-RAISING THAN THE DENIAL.  HEAR US WELL: THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT HAS STATED THAT IT SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS' EFFORTS TO
CRUSH THE OFFENSIVE WHICH HAS CAUSED SO MANY PERSONAL TRAGEDIES; AND IT
PRAISED THE ARMY FOR DECREEING STRICT LAWS TO PREVENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.

   WE ALSO HEAR THE PET EXPRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS USING CIVILIANS TO
PROTECT ITS FIGHTERS, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF REMOVING THE PEOPLE FROM
THEIR ENVIRONMENT IS UNSCRUPULOUSLY APPLIED ONCE MORE.  THIS IS WHY
THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WAS DESTROYED, LEAVING ENTIRE TOWNS
IN RUINS -- AND NOW LARGE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT CITIES
ARE BEING DESTROYED.  ONE DAY THOSE RUINS WILL BECOME THE EVIDENCE WE
WILL SHOW OUR CHILDREN TO PROVE THAT FASCISM ONCE EXISTED IN THE
COUNTRY.

   HOWEVER, THE U.S. IMPERIALISM'S CLUMSINESS GOES EVEN FURTHER.  THE
NORTH AMERICANS APPARENTLY WANT TO BECOME INVOLVED IN A LARGE-SCALE
CONFLICT -- FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS WHO HAVE ALREADY
EARNED THE WORLD'S SCORN -- GIVEN THE DECISION TO SEND U.S.  PILOTS TO
BOMB THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY NIGHT.  THE FASCIST SALVADORAN
DICTATORSHIP HAS UNLEASHED THE BRUTAL TACTICS USED BY SOMOZA BEFORE
LEAVING POWER.  ON THAT OCCASION THE U.S. IMPERIALISM TURNED ITS BACK
ON THE TYRANT.

   THE UNITED STATES' FOREIGN POLICY HAVE NEVER STOOPED SO LOW AND THE
DECISIONS ADOPTED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE NEVER BROUGHT THE
POSSIBILITY OF A REGIONAL CONFLICT SO CLOSE.  WHAT DOES THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT THINK ABOUT THE AIRPLANES BEING FLOWN BY U.S.  PILOTS ONLY
A FEW HUNDRED KM FROM ITS BORDER?  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF GUATEMALA
CONTINUES TO INVOLVE ITSELF IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT?  THE
CONSEQUENCES ARE UNFORESEEABLE.  THE U.S. IMPERIALISM HAS SOILED ITS
HANDS WITH A NEW GENOCIDE IN EL SALVADOR.  THE U.S. PEOPLE SHOULD
DEEPLY REFLECT ABOUT THIS AND STOP THEIR GOVERNMENT FROM PROVOKING
CONTEMPT OF THAT NATION -- WHICH IS BEING DISINFORMED AND INTOXICATED
BY THE ANTI-COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA.

   LARGE GROUPS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S PEOPLE, THE BEST SONS OF THE
UNITED STATES, HAVE REACTED AND HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS --DEEP
INSIDE THE U.S. IMPERIALISM'S HEART.  SOON, VERY SOON, THIS WILL
BECOME AN UNSTOPPABLE SURGE.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGIC GOAL IS
CLEAR: THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  TO QUOTE MONSIGNOR [OSCAR
ARNULFO] ROMERO, THE ARMY -- AND IN THIS CASE THE NORTH
AMERICANS -- ARE LIKE SERPENTS, WHICH ONLY BITE THE SHOELESS.  YET
THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN IN ANGER AND DIGNITY, AND
THEY ARE COMING TO PULL OUT THE FASCIST SERPENT'S FANGS.

   BURGOS (SPAIN), 19 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] APPROXIMATELY 1,000
PEOPLE DEMONSTRATED TODAY AT THE BURGOS MAIN SQUARE (CENTRAL) TO ASK
THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO MEDIATE IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, AND IN
BARCELONA (NORTHEASTERN), A DEMONSTRATION TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR 22 NOVEMBER.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS, CONVOKED BY THE SOLIDARITY WITH LATIN AMERICA
COMMITTEE, VERBALLY ATTACKED SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI
AND HAVE ASKED THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO OFFER ITSELF AS A MEDIATOR TO
PROMOTE AN END THE ARMED CONFLICT.

   SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED THE DEMONSTRATION, WHICH WAS HELD
WITHOUT INCIDENTS, CARRIED PLACARTS DENOUNCING THE KILLING OF SIX
JESUIT PRIESTS -- FIVE OF WHOM WERE SPANISH CITIZENS -- AND TWO
SALVADORAN WOMEN AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.

   MEANWHILE, CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS, STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS, LABOR UNIONS,
AND POLITICAL PARTIES IN CATALUNA HAVE SCHEDULED A DEMONSTRATION IN
SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO BE HELD IN BARCELONA ON 22

BOMBING OF CIVILIANS, THE IMMEDIATE EVACUATION OF THE WOUNDED, AND AN
END TO ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNION HEADQUARTERS AND LEADERS.

   LIKEWISE, THE COMMITTEE HAS DEMANDED AN END TO U.S. INTERVENTION IN
EL SALVADOR AND THAT THE GUATEMALAN AND HONDURAN ARMIES REFRAIN FROM
PARTICIPATING IN THE CONFLICT.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 19 NOV 89 (EL GRAFICO) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO
HAS TACITLY BLAMED PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION FOR THE
CRISIS WHICH PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY AS A RESULT OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S (FMLN) OFFENSIVE WHICH WAS LAUNCHED ON SATURDAY
11 NOVEMBER.

   CEREZO ATTENDED THE CONCLUSION OF A SEMINAR SPONSORED BY THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR POLITICAL STUDIES (INCEP) ON 17
NOVEMBER.  THE EVENT WAS HELD AT 2100 AT THE GUATEMALA FIESTA HOTEL.

   THE NEW CENTRAL AMERICAN VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICA (ODCA) WAS SWORN IN AT THE EVENT.  CARLOS
MORALES EHRLICH, OF EL SALVADOR, WAS REPLACED BY PROFESSOR CATALINA
SOBERANIS, OF GUATEMALA.

   DURING HIS SPEECH MORALES EHRLICH BLAMED THE EXTREME RIGHT DEATH
SQUADS OF EL SALVADOR FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AT
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.

   DURING HIS SPEECH, WHICH WAS MORE LIKE AN INFORMAL CHAT, PRESIDENT
CEREZO ATTRIBUTED THE SITUATION WHICH PREVAILS IN EL SALVADOR TO
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S INEFFICIENCY.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] HEAVY CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW IN ESCALON AND
SAN BENITO RESIDENTIAL AREAS.  THERE IS NO GOING BACK.  WE HAVE BROKEN
THE DEFENSIVE LINES OF THE ENEMY.  WE HAVE BROKEN [WORDS INDISTINCT]
IN THE CAPITAL CITY, WE ARE FIGHTING IN FRONT OF THE DENS OF COLONEL
PONCE AND OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAVE TURNED THE WAR INTO A BUSINESS.
THOSE OFFICERS HAVE LUXURIOUS MANSIONS IN MIAMI.  EVERY WEEKEND AND
EVEN IN SPITE OF THE WAR, COL PONCE HAS ORGIES IN HIS LUXURIOUS HOMES
IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.  SOLDIERS, PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WE CALL ON
YOU TO JOIN THE PEOPLE AND JOIN OUR FRONT.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WHO
ARE LISTENING TO US, DO NOT ALLOW MORE BOMBINGS IN OUR CAPITAL CITY BY
THE GENOCIDAL TANDONA GROUP [1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPT GEN
GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY SCHOOL].  YOUNG OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS WHO ARE
BEING KILLED IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL
CITY, WHY SHOULD YOU BE KILLED WHILE DEFENDING PONCE'S MANSIONS?  THIS
IS THE LAST SCENARIO OF THE LAST CHAPTER IN WHICH THE FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WILL ACHIEVE THE VICTORY OF THE
PEOPLE.  WE CALL ON YOUR CONSCIENCE, YOUNG PATRIOTIC OFFICER.

   JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBINGS OF ZACAMIL.  OVER 500
HOMES WERE RAZED.  ARE YOU GOING TO ALLOW THE HIGH COMMAND TO FINISH
OFF THE CITY, TO FINISH OFF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS
WHERE YOUR RELATIVES MIGHT BE?  YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN ZACAMIL,
MEJICANOS, SOYAPANGO.  PATRIOTIC OFFICER, IT IS TIME WE SIT DOWN TO
TALK, TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR FATHERLAND, AND WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO WITH LA TANDONA.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS WHO ARE LISTENING TO US: IT
IS USELESS TO CONTINUE DEFENDING; TO CONTINUE DEFENDING WHAT, WE ASK
YOU.  THE FATHERLAND?  WHAT FATHERLAND?  THE FATHERLAND YOU ARE TOLD
YOU ARE DEFENDING ARE THE MILLIONS AND THE MANSIONS OF COL PONCE AND
OF COL ELENA FUENTES.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS: THE TIME IS HERE, TAKE ONE
STEP FORWARD.

   WE HAVE MORE REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR: EARLY THIS MORNING, COMBAT
HAS BEEN RESUMED IN THE FOLLOWING PLACES: ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND LA
SULTANA RESIDENTIAL AREAS.  THESE ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE SOLDIERS
FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 AND THE CAVALRY.  COMBATS ARE ALSO
REPORTED NORTH OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE 4TH AND 1ST
INFANTRY BRIGADE.  THERE ARE ALSO CLASHES IN THE AREA OF METROPOLIS
AND ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOODS AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE BRACAMONTE
BATTALION.

   IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN SAN BENITO AND LA SULTANA
RESIDENTIAL AREAS, WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE,
AND NOT FROM SAN SALVADOR.  THE SOLDIERS ARE FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT
NO. 6 OF SONSONATE.  TROOPS FROM SONSONATE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO SAN
SALVADOR, BECAUSE THE HIGH COMMAND HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.
IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A MIXTURE OF SOLDIERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THIS HAS YIELDED NEGATIVE RESULTS FOR
THE HIGH COMMAND.  IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES
BETWEEN THE ATLACATL BATTALION AND THE NATIONAL POLICE, AND THE
NATIONAL GUARD HAS ATTACKED TROOPS FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6.
THESE ARE LITTLE SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO
THE CAPITAL CITY, AND THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CITY.  THEY ARE
CLASHING AGAINST EACH OTHER.

   CLASHES ARE ALSO REPORTED WITH THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE 1ST
INFANTRY BRIGADE IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE 4TH INFANTRY
BRIGADE IS FIGHTING IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE
INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY?  THE GARRISONS HAVE BEEN LEFT EMPTY.  THE SAN
FRANCISCO GOTERA GARRISON HAS BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ANYONE.  THE 4TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE IS BEING LEFT BY ITSELF, AS WELL AS THE MILITARY
DETACHMENT NO. 1.  THE COLONELS ARE DESPERATE AND ARE BRINGING TROOPS
INTO THE CAPITAL CITY.

   THIS IS A GOOD REPORT.  THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND MILITARY
DETACHMENT NO. 6 ARE IN THE CAPITAL.  THIS IS THE SITUATION ON THIS
MORNING OF VICTORIOUS BATTLES.  WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT?  THE SONSONATE
SOLDIERS ARE FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THIS GIVES US A GENERAL
PICTURE OF THE DEFEAT.  IF THE SONSONATE TROOPS ARE FIGHTING IN THE
LAST DEFENSIVE LINE, THIS MEANS THAT THE SONSONATE LINES HAVE BEEN
WIPED OUT.

   ATTENTION, FMLN ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS HAVE OPENED FIRE WITH THEIR M-60
MACHINEGUNS AGAINST UH-1H HELICOPTERS THAT ARE FLYING OVER THE
RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF THE OLIGARCHY.  LIKEWISE, A HELICOPTER IS RIGHT
NOW FLYING OVER THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF OFFICES.  FMLN UNITS
ARE FIRING THEIR ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS IN THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL
AREA.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE REBEL COMMANDERS
WHO DIRECTED THE OCCUPATION OF SEVERAL SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS LAST
WEEK, TODAY HEADED THE SEIZURE OF THE SHERATON HOTEL, WHERE OAS
SECRETARY GENERAL JOAO BAENA SOARES WAS TRAPPED FOR MORE THAN 8 HOURS.

   NEWSMEN WHO ENTERED THE HOTEL THIS AFTERNOON DURING THE EVACUATION
OF BAENA BY DIPLOMATS WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT COMMANDER AMILCAR,
KNOWN AS "EL CHOCO," WHO DIRECTED THE COMBAT OPERATIONS IN THE ZACAMIL
NEIGHBORHOOD, WAS SEEN TODAY ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE SHERATON HOTEL.

   SEVERAL REBELS HAVE SAID THAT FACUNDO GUARDADO ("COMMANDER
ESTEBAN"), ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE OFFENSIVE THAT BEGAN IN
THE CAPITAL ON 11 NOVEMBER, IS SOMEWHERE NEAR THE HOTEL.

   ACCORDING TO THE REBELS, GUARDADO EXPECTED TO INITIATE THIS
AFTERNOON'S "NEGOTIATIONS" WITH THE MANAGER OF THE HOTEL, ROBERT
NEWELL.  SEVERAL U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AS WELL AS ONE FROM GUATEMALA
AND ANOTHER ONE FROM CHILE REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THE REBELS.  EL
CHOCO SAID: "WE CAN RESIST FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE TO.  ALL THEY CAN DO
IS BOMB THE PLACE AND LET US SEE IF THEY ARE WILLING TO DO THAT."

   ACCORDING TO THE YOUNG GUERRILLA COMMANDER, THE REBEL WITHDRAWAL
FROM THE ZACAMIL, CUSCATANCINGO, AND MEJICANOS NEIGHBORHOODS, AMONG
OTHERS, "WAS PART OF THE PLAN" THAT WAS COMPLETED TODAY WITH THE
ARRIVAL AT THE SHERATON HOTEL AREA.  THE REBEL SAID: "WE HAVE COME
HERE TODAY, TO THE ESCALON COLONY, TO THEIR AREA, THE AREA OF THE
BOURGEOISIE, TO SEE IF THEY DO HERE WHAT THEY DID WITH THE PEOPLE, WHO
WERE HURT BY THE AIR FORCE BOMBING OPERATIONS."

   AT 0430 (1030 GMT) TODAY, THE FMLN GUERRILLAS INITIATED HEAVY
FIGHTING AROUND THE SHERATON HOTEL, WHERE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL JOAO
BAENA SOARES WAS STAYING.

   BAENA SOARES WAS EVACUATED FROM THE SHERATON HOTEL TO THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMED FORCES STAFF WHERE HE MET WITH THE "HIGHEST
SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES," ACCORDING TO DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY SOURCES.

   THIS AFTERNOON, THE GUERRILLAS ARE STILL OCCUPYING SEVERAL FLOORS
OF THE HOTEL, WHICH HAS BULLET HOLES, DESTROYED WINDOWS, AND BROKEN
FURNITURE ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

   THE AREA HAS BEEN SURROUNDED BY LIGHT ARMORED TANKS AND IS BEING
PATROLLED BY SEVERAL ARMED SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 22 NOV 89 (RADIO REBELDE NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] THE PICTURE PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE NEWSPAPER GRANMA IN ITS
THIRD EDITION SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.  IN FACT, AS THE NEWSPAPER SUGGESTS,
THE YANKEE HAND IS TODAY IN EL SALVADOR AS IT WAS YESTERDAY IN
VIETNAM.  THE WOUNDED MOTHER WHO TRIES TO COMFORT HER DAUGHTER, A
VICTIM OF THE BOMBINGS, IS NOT AN ISOLATED PICTURE.  IT IS A SYMBOL OF
THE CRIMES THAT ARE BEING COMMITTED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN
THAT COUNTRY.

   THE UNITED STATES IS NOT INNOCENT OF THESE CRIMES BECAUSE U.S.
PILOTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE MASSACRE.  IN THE MEANTIME, WHAT IS
THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION DOING?  IN FACT, HE IS DOING NOTHING THAT
COULD NOT BE PREDICTED.  PRESIDENT BUSH GETS ON THE PHONE AND CALLS
HIS SALVADORAN CRONY ALFREDO CRISTINI TO ASSURE HIM THAT EVERYTHING IS
ALL RIGHT, THAT HE CAN GO ON, THAT THE U.S.  POSITION IS FAVORABLE TO
HIS REGIME.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION ASKS NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
RECENT BRUTAL KILLINGS OF UNION LEADERS BY THE ARMY.  BUSH ASKS NO
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MASSACRE OF SPANISH PRIESTS.  THE PRESIDENT ONLY
PRAISES THE ARMY, THE AIR FORCE, THE POLICE AND PARAMILITARY EFFORTS
TO STOP THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE.

   BUSH AND CRISTIANI COULD NOT FAIL TO MENTION THE TRITE SLOGAN OF
THE CUBAN AND NICARAGUAN AID TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.  NOR DID
BUSH FAIL TO EXPRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S SOLIDARITY.  BUT,
SOLIDARITY WITH WHOM?  ALL WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT UP TO NOW ARE THE
PROTESTS PROVOKED IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE U.S.  MILITARY AID TO
THE SALVADORAN REGIME. THE ONLY REALITIES ARE THE DEMONSTRATIONS
STAGED FROM LOS ANGELES TO NEW YORK TO REPUDIATE THE U.S. AID.  THE
ONLY FACT IS THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION IS BEING PUBLICLY
QUESTIONED ABOUT THIS AID.  THE ONLY PICTURE THAT HAS BEEN
DISSEMINATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IS THAT OF A WOMAN WHO INTERRUPTS
BUSH'S SPEECH TO SHOUT TO HIM: WHY ARE WE SENDING MONEY TO EL
SALVADOR? WHY ARE WE KILLING PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR?  IT IS NOT
POSSIBLE TO OVERLOOK THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THE
CURRENT SALVADORAN SITUATION.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST BE
AWARE OF THIS REALITY AND MUST ACT ACCORDINGLY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI, IN PROGRESS] [TEXT] ...THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE ON 11 NOVEMBER.  THE FMLN LAUNCHED THIS AGGRESSION WITH ALL OF
ITS FORCES, CHIEFLY USING A CONCENTRATION OF WEAPONS AND FIGHTERS IN
THE SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN ZONE, IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ
DEPARTMENT, AND AT TIMES IN USULUTAN CITY, USULUTAN DEPARMENT, AND IN
SAN MIGUEL CITY, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT.  IN THIS AGGRESSION THE FMLN
DISPLAYED ITS WEAPONRY.  IT DISPLAYED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS,
WHICH....[CHANGES THOUGHT] BY THE WAY, IN RECENT DAYS THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES HAVE BEGUN A NUMBER OF SEARCHES IN SOME HOUSES WHERE IT
IS BELIEVED THAT SOME OF THESE WEAPONS WERE LOCATED. WE HAVE ALREADY
FOUND LARGE AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS.

   IN ADDITION, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AND HID BEHIND YOU,
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  IT USED YOU AS A SHIELD, WANTING TO CONVEY THE
IDEA THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT THE
PEOPLE HERE WOULD RISE UP TO SUPPORT THEM.  THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT
THIS VIEW IS TOTALLY FALSE.  FAR FROM SUPPORTING THE FMLN, THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE, SALVADORAN BROTHERS, SUPPORTED THE ARMED FORCES IN
THE TREMENDOUS EFFORT IT HAS CONDUCTED TO REPEL THE FMLN AGGRESSION.

   HOWEVER, WE MUST NOW CONSIDER A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER.  IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN AGGRESSION OF THIS SIZE WITHOUT SUPPORT
FROM SOMEONE ABROAD.  ON THIS OCCASION, WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS
SUPPORT CAME FROM NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA AND CUBAN PRESIDENT
CASTRO, BUT CHIEFLY FROM ORTEGA WHO IS TRYING TO RAISE A SMOKESCREEN
IN THE FACE OF THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT MRS VIOLETTA CHAMORRO MAY
DEFEAT HIM IN THE ELECTIONS, AND BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE
PUPPET OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST AGGRESSION IN WHICH ORTEGA AND
CASTRO PARTICIPATE.  IF THIS IS NOT SO, LET US TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAS
HAPPENED.  DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU WERE SUFFERING MOMENTS OF
ANGUISH LAST WEEK, YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LARGE NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS
WHO WERE SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  WE HAVE ALSO MANAGED TO
COLLECT EVIDENCE THAT THE ORTEGA GOVERNMENT TRAINED FMLN FIGHTERS IN
THE USE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF WEAPONRY, SPECIFICALLY THE GRENADE
LAUNCHERS.

   WHAT HAPPENED?  IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE BEGAN NOTICING WHAT KIND
OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED.  IN THE FOILED ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL
HOUSE, A SUBSEQUENT ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' JOINT
CHIEFS OF STAFF, AND LASTLY, AN ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL GUARD GARRISON
PARTICULAR KINDS OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED.  AS A RESULT OF THE
SAVAGE ACTION BY FMLN, TWO LITTLE GIRLS WERE KILLED.  MOREOVER, LET US
RECALL AND SEE THE CONNECTION THAT EXISTS WITH ALL THE SHIPMENTS THAT
THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN STOPPING BETWEEN NICARAGUAN AND
EL SALVADOR.  ONE SHIPMENT WAS MADE PRIOR TO THE VISIT WE PRESIDENTS
MADE TO COSTA RICA.  IN THAT COUNTRY, WE DENOUNCED ORTEGA FOR
CONTINUING TO SEND WEAPONS AND SUPPORTING THE FMLN IN AN OPEN
VIOLATION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS.

   AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED LATELY?  ON 25 NOVEMBER, SALVADORAN PEOPLE,
TWO LIGHT AIRPLANES COMING FROM NICARAGUA WERE DISCOVERED.  THEIR
FLIGHT COURSE INDICATES THAT THEY CAME FROM NICARAGUA, ESPECIALLY THE
ONE WHERE THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND.  AS ADDITIONAL PROOF, WE HAVE A
DOCUMENT SHOWING THAT ONE LIGHT AIRCRAFT BELONGS TO THE SETA
TRANSPORTATION COMPANY LOCATED IN NICARAGUA'S AUGUSTO CESAR SANDINO
AIRPORT.  IT WAS BRINGING SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR THE FMLN.  IN
THAT AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT, FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED: THE PILOT WHO WAS
WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE WEARING MILITARY
UNIFORMS; I MEAN CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS LIKE THE ONES WORN IN MANY
COUNTRIES, AND LIKE THE ONES THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCE USE.  IT IS
BELIEVED THAT TWO OF THOSE PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT.
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANOTHER PERSON KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD A
WEAPON IN HIS HAND AND A BULLET WOUND IN FOREHEAD.  HE KILLED HIMSELF
BECAUSE HE SAW HIMSELF IMPLICATED IN THIS SITUATION.  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] OUR FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FORCES HAVE TAKEN OVER
BUNKERS FROM THE VARIOUS MILITARY CHIEFS IN ESCALON AND MANUEL JOSE
ARCE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE OUR UNITS SEIZED THOUSANDS OF CARTRIDGES,
RIFLES, GRENADES, AND OTHER TYPES OF ARMS WHICH THESE MILITARY CHIEFS
USUALLY STORE IN THE BUNKERS THAT THEY MAINTAIN IN THESE RESIDENTIAL
SECTORS.

   AS WE HAVE REPORTED, THE GENERAL STAFF RESPONDED WITH A 4-PRONGED
DELAYED RESPONSE.  THE ARMED FORCES ATTACKED FROM FOUR ADVANCED
POSITIONS, ONE HELD BY THE BRACAMONTE BATTALION, WHICH ADVANCED TOWARD
ESCALON; IT WAS NEUTRALIZED BY OUR AMBUSHES.  OUR UNITS ARE ENTRENCHED
IN THE MANSIONS OF THE OLIGARCHS IN THAT SECTOR OF ESCALON
NEIGHBORHOOD.  THEY AMBUSHED AND REPELLED ATTACKS FROM THE VANGUARD
POSITIONS LAUNCHED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  THE SECOND DIRECTION IN WHICH
THE ENEMY RESPONDED TO OUR PRESENCE WAS DIRECTED ON THE SOUTHERN
FREEWAY.  THIS SECOND POSITION WAS AMBUSHED WITH RPG-7 ROCKET
LAUNCHERS AND MACHINEGUN FIRE.  THE THIRD ENEMY POSITION, WHICH WAS
ADVANCING ON SANTA TECLA, WAS AMBUSHED AT LA UNIVERSAL POINT AND WAS
ALSO NEUTRALIZED.  THE ATLACATL BATTALION DEPLOYMENT ALONG GUADALUPE
GARDENS WAS ALSO NEUTRALIZED.  OUR BATTALIONS ARE STAGING SABOTAGE
ACTIONS ON ELECTRICITY POSTS IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO
NEIGHBORHOODS.

   ALSO, WE HAVE A NEW REPORT WHICH INDICATES THAT FMLN UNITS HAVE SET
UP DOWNED ELECTRICITY POSTS AS BARRICADES ALONG THE SOUTH FREEWAY AND
IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD.  WE REPEAT, ALONG THE SOUTH FREEWAY AND
IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, FMLN UNITS HAVE USED DOWNED ELECTRICITY
POSTS AND VEHICLES AS BARRICADES.

   THIS IS THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.  THROUGHOUT THE NORTHERN
SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL, OUR UNITS ARE MAINTAINING POSITIONS.  THE
TROOPS IN THE INTERIOR PART OF THE REPUBLIC IN THAT NORTHERN REGION
REFUSE TO ADVANCE TOWARD OUR POSITIONS, WHILE OUR UNITS ARE EXTENDING
ALONG THE NORTHWESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN REGION OF THE CAPITAL.  OUR
UNITS ARE EXTENDING AND MOVING FOWARD ALONG THESE ZONES.  THE AIR
FORCE HAS OPENED FIRE ON SOME OF OUR POSITIONS IN THE ESCALON AND SAN
BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS.  WE REITERATE THE CALL TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE
ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS TO ABANDON ALL THOSE ZONES
IMMEDIATELY.  THE AIR FORCE IS BEGINNING NEW AIR RAIDS ON FMLN
POSITIONS IN THOSE REGIONS.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON THE INHABITANTS OF
THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS TO LEAVE THOSE AREAS.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 1 DEC 89 (RADIO CORPORACION) -- [TEXT] LA
PRENSA NEWSPAPER TODAY REPORTED THAT THE SANDINISTS DID SEND A PLANE
TO EL SALVADOR.  THE AIRCRAFT IS A CESSNA 310.  THE IDENTITY OF THE
CREWMEN IN THE NICARAGUAN PLANES THAT CRASHED IN EL SALVADOR OVER THE
PAST WEEKEND CARRYING SOVIET ARMS IS A STATE SECRET ACCEDED TO BY LA
PRENSA THIS MORNING AFTER GETTING IN TOUCH WITH A HIGH-RANKING SOURCE
IN THE SANDINIST ARMY.  THE SOURCE DISCLOSED FURTHER DETAILS OF THE
BUTTERFLY OPERATION.  THE ARMY SOURCE, WHICH OF COURSE REQUESTED TO
REMAIN ANONYMOUS, CONFIRMED THAT THE PLANE THAT CRASHED IN SAN MIGUEL
BELONGS TO NICARAGUA AND THAT THE PLANE'S REGISTRATION IS YANKEE
NOVEMBER BRAVO YANKEE KILO.

   THERE ARE NO REPORTS SO FAR AS TO WHETHER ANY RELATIVES HAVE
CLAIMED THE BODIES OF THE FOUR MILITARY MEN WHO WERE REPORTEDLY KILLED
WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED. THREE OF THE CREWMEN WERE KILLED INSTANTLY,
WHILE THE FOURTH COMMITTED SUICIDE.  A PICTURE OF A YOUNG CUBAN GIRL,
DATED IN JULY, IS THE ONLY PUBLISHED CLUE AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE
MEN, WHETHER NICARAGUANS, CUBANS, OR SALVADORANS, COMMISSIONED FOR
THIS CLANDESTINE MISSION DIRECTED FROM NICARAGUA.  OUR SOURCE SAID
THAT YOUNG SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS WERE TRAINED AT THE NATIONAL CIVILIAN
FLIGHT SCHOOL OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  THE TRAINING WAS SUPERVISED
BY CAPTAIN ROBIN ROMERO, THE FLIGHT SCHOOL'S DIRECTOR.  THE TRAINING
WAS ALSO CONDUCTED AT PUNTA HUETE AND LOS BRASILES.  MOST OF THE
FLIGHTS WERE MADE AT NIGHT. THE STUDENT PILOTS USED OIL LAMPS AS
LANDING LIGHTS.  THE SOURCE SAID THE TRAINING FLIGHTS WERE CONDUCTED
IN LIGHT SINGLE-ENGINE PLANES FROM SANDINO AIRPORT TO PUNTA HUETE OR
LOS BRASILES.

   THE HEAD OF THIS OPERATION WAS COMMANDER CHRISTIAN PICHARDO.  IN
THE OPERATION ALSO PARTICIPATED TWO SALVADORAN GUERRILLA COMMANDERS
WHOSE IDENTITIES ARE UNKNOWN.  THE CESSNA 310 HAD BEEN LEASED BY THE
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK [BND], WHICH IN TURN HAD ACQUIRED THE PLANE
FROM THE ZETA NATIONAL CHARTER SERVICE, AN AERONICA SUBSIDIARY.  BND
ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR MARCOS BLANDON GRAVY LEASED THE PLANE, ONE OF
SEVERAL AIRCRAFT INTENDED TO BE SENT TO EL SALVADOR.  ANOTHER
SINGLE-ENGINE CESSNA, WITH REGISTRATION CHARLIE BRAVO PAPA, AND AN
AERO COMMANDER, WERE ADDED TO THE INVENTORY.  ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE,
THE AERO COMMANDER WAS CONFISCATED FROM COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN
PUERTO CABEZAS A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY SANDINIST AIR
FORCE [FAS] PLANES.  THE PLANES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION, HOWEVER,
REMAINED UNEQUIPPED TO FLY TO EL SALVADOR UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

HAVE INFORMED THIS NETWORK THAT TERRORIST [WORDS INDISTINCT] ALBERTO CHICA
FERNANDEZ, A LEADER IN THE [NAME INDISTINCT] LABOR UNION, CONFESSED THAT THE
FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORIST LEADERS MAY
INITIATE SUMMARY ACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO PURGING THE LEADERS OF LEFTIST
GROUPS BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE SO-CALLED "FINAL OFFENSIVE TO THE END."

   CHICA SAID THAT THE TERRORIST LEADERSHIP HAS VIOLENTLY [WORD
INDISTINCT] HUMBERTO CENTENO, MARCO TULIO LIMA, AND AN INDIVIDUAL
IDENTIFIED ONLY AS JULIO CESAR, FROM THE UNTS [NATIONAL UNION OF
SALVADORAN WORKERS], AS WELL AS OTHER LEFTIST LEADERS, FOR
PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION REGARDING THE CONDITIONS FOR A POPULAR
INSURRECTION.

   ACCORDING TO CHICA, THE FMLN LEADERS IN MANAGUA DECIDED TO LAUNCH
THE OFFENSIVE, TRUSTING THE UNTS LEADERS' REPORTS THAT CONDITIONS WERE
RIGHT FOR AN INSURRECTION BECAUSE FEBE ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ' DEATH IN
THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL
UNION FEDERATION] HAD IGNITED THE PEOPLE'S SPIRITS.  THE
PRISONER SAID THAT THE FMLN MAY CARRY OUT A SUMMARY TRIAL IN THE STYLE
OF COMMUNIST PARTIES AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE.

   NOW, HE SAID, TO SAVE THEMSELVES FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HAVING
DECEIVED THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS WHO ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE LED BY
LIES, THE UNTS LEADERS ARE EXPECTED TO CALL NEWS CONFERENCES TO
ANNOUNCE THAT THEIR STRUGGLE CONTINUES.

   MEANWHILE, A REPORT FROM ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT, INDICATES
THAT FMLN TERRORIST CRIMINALS, USING SAM-7 MISSILES, ATTACKED A
SALVADORAN AIR FORCE 0-2 AIRPLANE WHICH WAS IN THE AREA DIRECTING
SUPPORT NEAR PIEDRA GRANDE ABAJO IN THE JURISDICTION OF ZACATECOLUCA.
NO DAMAGES OR CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED.

   ANOTHER FMLN MISSILE WAS FIRED FROM LAS PIEDRAS HILL, IN THE SAME
AREA, AGAINST ANOTHER SALVADORAN AIR FORCE 0-2 AIRPLANE, BUT THE
AIRPLANE WAS NOT DAMAGED.  THE SOURCE SAYS THE MISSILE EXPLODED IN THE

   [GUEVARA] HOW DO THE FIVE PRESIDENTS CONCEIVE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF
THE FMLN?  HOW DOES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CONCEIVE THIS HAPPENING?

   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THIS
PRESIDENTIAL MEETING AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MEETINGS.  TO EXPLAIN
THIS BETTER, MARCO ANTONIO, WE MUST SAY WE WILL NOT FALL INTO WHAT HAS
BEEN USED IN THE PAST, THAT IS, THE FAMOUS SYMMETRY.  ON THIS
OCCASION, WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL WHEN WE SAID THAT WE
WERE NOT WILLING TO CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING SACRIFICES AND OTHER THINGS
FROM THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE NICARAGUAN
PROBLEM EXCLUSIVELY.  WE DEMANDED UNIFORMITY, AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY
CONFRONTING THE AGGRESSION OF AN IRREGULAR FORCE -- ANY OTHER COUNTRY
IN CENTRAL AMERICA -- ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED IN A UNIFORM
MANNER, AS FAR AS MEASURES AND CRITERIA THAT MAY BE ADOPTED IN THE
PRESIDENTIAL MEETINGS.

   THAT IS WHY TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE SEEING HOW THE
MEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE -- THAT HAD BEEN
GRANTED MOST OF THE ATTENTION UP TO NOW -- ARE ALSO BEING ADOPTED FOR
THE FMLN.

   WE CANNOT ALLOW A COUNTRY TO CLAIM IT IS THE ONLY TARGET OF AN
AGGRESSION BY AN IRREGULAR ARMED FORCE SUPPORTED FROM ABROAD.  HERE IN
EL SALVADOR WE NOW HAVE GREATER EVIDENCE FOLLOWING THIS 11 NOVEMBER
TERRORIST AGGRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS A MOVEMENT THAT CAN SURVIVE ONLY
WITH SUPPORT FROM ABROAD, AND THAT IT OBEYS AND EXISTS BECAUSE OF
INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENTS.

   IN THE SECOND PLACE, IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT ONLY HAS THE
CAPACITY TO GENERATE TERRORISM, WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THIS
DOCUMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE JUST TALKING ABOUT DEMOBILIZATION AND
PACIFICATION IN NICARAGUA.  IT IS TIME TO APPLY THIS TO ALL IRREGULAR
GROUPS, BE IT THE URNG [GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY] IN
GUATEMALA, OR ANY OTHER IRREGULAR ARMED GROUP THAT MAY COME UP AND MAY
TRY TO HINDER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE AREA.

   WE SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE DEEP INTO THE MINDS OF ALL
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, AND FROM NOW ON, WE WILL HAVE GREATER
UNIFORMITY IN TREATING ALL OF THOSE IRREGULAR GROUPS THAT OPERATE IN
THE REGION.

   [MODERATOR] RENE HURTADO OF EL MUNDO.

   [HURTADO] MR PRESIDENT, FOLLOWING THE TELA AND COSTA DEL SOL
MEETINGS, NICARAGUA HAS CHANGED ITS STAND.  IN COSTA RICA, PRESIDENT
ORTEGA WAS ASKED IF HE HAD SOLD OUT THE FMLN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE
DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE SUMMIT IN FAVOR
OF NICARAGUA.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS, AND ALSO
HOW YOU INTERPRET THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT ORTEGA HAS ACCEPTED SOME
ISSUES ABOUT THE FMLN THAT HE DID NOT ALLOW IN TELA OR COSTA DEL SOL?
ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN BE THE RESULT
OF A DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS LATER ON?

   [CRISTIANI] IN THE FIRST PLACE, I BELIEVE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA WAS
UNABLE TO PULL ANY MORE TRICKS OUT OF HIS HAT, AND HE WAS FACING A
FACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO IS SPREADING ARMED
REVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER DEMOCRATIC
PROCESSES IN THE REGION.  ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT HONORING
THE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE
COMMITMENTS.  ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLE
DEFENSE.

   THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPT
THE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELF
TOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.
THIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES IN
POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS.

   CLANDESTINE, 13 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
COMRADES: A NEW ELEMENT THAT WE MUST ANALYZE AND EXPLAIN EMERGED AT
THE CONCLUSION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' EMERGENCY MEETING.
LET US SEE FIRST WHY THE MEETING TOOK PLACE.  THE MAIN REASON IS THE
VERY COMPLICATED PREDICAMENT IN WHICH OUR OFFENSIVE HAS PLACED
CRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  AS YOU WILL REMEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT
HAS MET WITH MUCH INTERNATIONAL DISREPUTE AND ISOLATION BECAUSE OF THE
BRUTAL ASSASSINATION OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE BOMBING OF THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.  LET US RECALL, AS A SIGNIFICANT FACT, THAT THE UNITED
NATIONS HAS CONDEMNED THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ALL IT HAS DONE,
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LATEST ATROCITIES.  ON THAT OCCASION, EL
SALVADOR WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT VOTED AGAINST THAT RESOLUTION WHILE
96 COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOR.

   WE MENTION THIS CASE AS A MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE, BUT THE FACT IS
THAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION THAT THE
DICTATORSHIP HAS FOUND ITSELF IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION.  THIS
WAS A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE NORTH AMERICANS.

   TO WHOM COULD THEY TURN AT A TIME WHEN ALL INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON CRISTIANI?  THE NORTH
AMERICANS HAD TO RESORT TO SOME FORUM THAT WOULD NOT CONDEMN THE
GENOCIDAL REGIME AND THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT IN
SPITE OF ALL THE ATROCITIES THE REGIME HAS COMMITTED.

   THE MOST SUITABLE IDEA WAS TO PROMOTE AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AS WE ALL
KNOW, THE NORTH AMERICANS HAVE HAD THEIR BACKYARD AND MOST OF THESE
COUNTRIES SERVE THEIR INTERESTS.

   THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO TRY TO PULL CRISTIANI OUT OF
INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.

   UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DID SUMMIT TAKE PLACE?  WE HAVE TO SAY FIRST
THAT THE PRESIDENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA, AND PROBABLY OF
GUATEMALA, HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MEETING.  THE SUBJECT
OF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY ARIAS AND CEREZO.  THIS
DOCUMENT EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
JOSEPH SULLIVAN, A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF LATIN
AMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WELL AS OTHER U.S.  STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS,
WERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING.  THE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR TO NICARAGUA
-- A PRO-U.S. MAN WHO INTRODUCED THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AT THE MEETING
-- WAS ALSO PRESENT, CONSPIRING ALL THE TIME.  THE FMLN WAS NOT EVEN
ALLOWED TO ENTER COSTA RICA.

   HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AND
IN SPITE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CRISTIANI WAS
ACHIEVED ALMOST AT THE PRICE OF KILLING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT.  IT
WAS NOT EASY.  THE U.S. WILL TO CONDEMN THE FMLN AND TO BACK CRISTIANI
PREVAILED IN THE MIDST OF MUCH BICKERING AND THE INSOLENCE OF THE
HONDURAN PRESIDENT.

   AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND SUPPORT FOR THE GENOCIDAL
REGIME EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE NORTH AMERICANS THINK THEY HAVE THE
BULL BY THE HORNS.

   LET US SEE, AS A THIRD POINT, IN WHAT THE DECLARATION CONSISTS.

   BOGOTA, 15 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] IN VIEW OF
THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION TODAY IN WHICH GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON
FREDDY, AND SEVERAL OF HIS BODYGUARDS WERE KILLED, PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO
TODAY CALLED AN URGENT COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION
AND RECEIVE A FULL REPORT FROM MILITARY AND POLICE AUTHORITIES.  HERE IS THE
SECOND PART OF THE NEWS CONFERENCE FEATURING DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL
MAZA MARQUEZ.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MAZA] THE DAS HAS EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT THIS
INDIVIDUAL MASTERMINDED TWO ATTACKS INCLUDING THE THE MOST RECENT AND
WORST ONE IN WHICH MORE THAN 60 INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

   [REPORTER] HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA
MASTERMINDED THE RECENT ATTACK ON DAS?

   [MAZA] BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE CONDUCTED ALONG WITH
THE NATIONAL POLICE EVER SINCE THE ATTACK OCCURRED POINT IN THAT
DIRECTION.  IF WE COMPARE THE MODUS OPERANDI OF RODRIGUEZ AND HIS
PEOPLE, WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE [WORD
INDISTINCT] AND THE ACTION ITSELF ARE VERY SIMILAR.  FURTHERMORE, THIS
MAN WAS IN THERE CELEBRATING THE GENOCIDE THAT HE HAD COMMITTED IN
BOGOTA.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [MAZA] BECAUSE THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS INDICATE THIS, AND
ACCORDING TO CERTAIN STATEMENTS WE HAVE, HE WAS OVERJOYED BY THE
DAMAGE THAT HE HAD CAUSED IN THE CITY GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
WHO WERE KILLED; SEEING HIM SUNBATHING AND SWIMMING ON THE ATLANTIC
COAST LED US TO BELIEVE THIS.

   [REPORTER] IS THIS A POLICE REACTION TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS'
ATTACK ON DAS?

   [MAZA] NO, I AM NOT SAYING THAT IT IS A REACTION.  THIS IS THE
RESULT OF VERY PROFESSIONAL WORK ON THE PART OF THE NATIONAL POLICE.
THAT IS WHAT I TOLD THE PRESIDENT TODAY.  I BRIEFED HIM ON THE EVENTS
WHICH LED TO THE ACTION THAT HAS CHANGED THE SITUATION WHICH HAD
PREVAILED IN THE COUNTRY JUST A FEW HOURS AGO.  [END RECORDING]

   SANTIAGO, 19 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN
FELIPE ERRAZURIZ HAS REPORTED THAT THE CHILEANS INVOLVED IN THE ABDUCTION OF
BRAZILIAN BUSINESSMAN ABILIO DINIZ WILL BE PROSECUTED IN BRAZIL BECAUSE THE
KIDNAPPING WAS PLANNED AND PERFORMED OUTSIDE OF CHILE.  HE NOTED THAT, IN
LINE WITH ITS POLICY IN SUCH MATTERS, THE CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS NOT
BEEN INVOLVED IN THE RELEASE OF THE BUSINESSMAN.

   DINIZ WAS RELEASED AFTER BEING HELD FOR 6 DAYS BY FIVE CHILEANS,
TWO CANADIANS, TWO ARGENTINES, AND ONE BRAZILIAN.  THE POLICE HAVE
REPORTED THAT THE CHILEANS CLAIMED TO BELONG TO THE EXTREMIST MIR
[MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT] GROUP, BUT THIS ASSERTION
HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED.

   ERRAZURIZ SAID THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS BEEN IN PERMANENT
CONTACT WITH CHILEAN AMBASSADOR TO BRAZIL RAUL SCHMIDT IN KEEPING
TRACK OF THE CASE.  THE MINISTER ALSO POINTED OUT THAT HE HAS BEEN IN
DIRECT CONTACT WITH INTERNATIONAL SECURITY SERVICES, INCLUDING
INTERPOL, TO DETERMINE THE IDENTITIES OF THE PRESUMED CHILEANS.


TST3-MUC4-0079

   QUITO, 18 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO A COMMUNIQUE GIVEN TO
AFP, THE INTERNATIONAL REBEL ORGANIZATION, THE AMERICA BATTALION, WILL
"CONTINUE ITS CONTINENTAL STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY, JUSTICE, AND LATIN
AMERICAN DIGNITY."  IN ADDITION TO THE COMMUNIQUE, PHOTOGRAPHS OF
REBELS IN MOUNTAIN AREAS WERE ALSO GIVEN TO AFP.

   SIGNED BY THE AMERICAN BATTALION'S GENERAL COMMAND, THE COMMUNIQUE
-- WRITTEN ON A SHEET WITHOUT THE ORGANIZATION'S LETTERHEAD -- STATES
THAT THEY BACK THE DECISIONS MADE BY THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19) OF
COLOMBIA AND ALVARO LIVES, DAMMIT! OF ECUADOR TO SIGN PEACE AND
DEMOCRACY AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS.

   THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THE TUPAC AMARU MOVEMENT OF
PERU, FOUNDED THE AMERICAN BATTALION IN COLOMBIA 5 YEARS AGO.  THE
BATTALION SUFFERED HEAVY CASUALTIES IN COLOMBIA AND IT WAS BELIEVED TO
HAVE DISAPPEARED.  TODAY'S COMMUNIQUE, HOWEVER, ANNOUNCED THE
EXISTENCE OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS FORMING THE AMERICAN BATTALION.

   THEY REQUEST THAT THE M-19 GIVE THEM THE SWORD OF LIBERATOR SIMON
BOLIVAR AND RECALLED THEIR ORGANIZATION'S PRINCIPLES AND CAMILO
TORRES' WORDS TO THE LIBERATOR: "GENERAL, AS LONG AS YOUR SWORD LIVES,
THE FATHERLAND IS NOT DEAD."

   THE REBELS ALSO STATE THAT THEY BACK SINCERE LATIN AMERICAN EFFORTS
TO ATTAIN PEACE FOR THE REGION AND "FIND POLITICAL SOLUTIONS WITH THE
LOWEST SOCIAL COST AND LOSS OF BLOOD FOR OUR PEOPLE."

   THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION TOLD THE ANDEAN PRESIDENTS MEETING
AT THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS THAT "TODAY THAT THEY HAVE THE POWER," THEY
SHOULD "EXERT IT IN FAVOR OF THE PEOPLE, IN FAVOR OF A TRUE
DEMOCRACY."  HOWEVER, THEY CRITICIZED "THE MURDERS IN STREETS OF
CARACAS," THE MURDERS IN THE JAILS OF PERU," AND "THE TORTURE IN THE
JAILS OF ECUADOR."

   WITH REGARD TO THE ANDEAN LEADERS, THE REBELS NOTED THAT "EITHER
THEY ARE WITH LATIN AMERICA OR THEY ARE WITH THE NORTHERN TYRANTS,"
REFERRING TO THE UNITED STATES.

   THE MOVEMENT STATES THAT THEY HAVE GATHERED ON REPRESSION AND
STATES THAT 4,000 UNION MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ILLEGALLY ARRESTED AND THAT
200,000 HAVE "DISAPPEARED."

   "THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE NOT ALONE," ADDS THE COMMUNIQUE AND
STATES THAT AT THE REQUEST OF THE PEOPLE OR THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, WE ARE "WILLING TO MOVE OUR MEN AND DECLARE
WAR ON THE FACISTS' FOREIGN ECONOMIC INTERESTS," INCLUDING "PRESIDENT
(ALFREDO) CRISTIANI'S DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES" IN THE REGION.

   CONCLUDING, THE COMMUNIQUE STATES: "IF LATIN AMERICANS HAVE TO GO
WITH BOLIVAR'S SWORD TO SAN SALVADOR AND CENTRAL AMERICA, WE WILL DO
SO."

   THE DOCUMENT IS SIGNED BY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VICTORS' PACE
REGIMENT [REGIMIENTO A PASO DE VENCEDORES], SAN MARTIN SOUTHERN FRONT
[FRENTE SUR SAN MARTIN], B-5-R NOBODY SURRENDERS HERE [B-5-R AQUI

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] OFFICIAL SOURCES TODAY
REPORTED THAT AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE, INCLUDING SOLDIERS, REBELS, AND
CIVILIANS, WERE KILLED DURING CLASHES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS
OVER THE PAST WEEKEND IN VARIOUS POINTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   MILITARY SPOKESMEN FOR THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, HEADQUARTERED IN
THE EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT TWO REBELS WERE
KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED DURING A CLASH WITH GOVERNMENT TROOPS IN SAN
AGUSTIN.

   MEANWHILE, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) REPORTED THAT
THE BODIES OF TWO GUERRILLAS, WHO WERE PRESUMABLY KILLED DURING
CLASHES WITH THE ARMY, WERE FOUND BY SOLDIERS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF
SANTA TECLA, IN THE CENTRAL LA LIBERTAD DEPARTMENT.

   COPREFA REPORTED THAT TWO SOLDIERS WERE KILLED DURING A CLASH WITH
MEMBERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IN
COMASAGUA, ABOUT 28 KM TO THE SOUTHWEST OF [SAN] SALVADOR, WHERE A REBEL
ATTACK ON A COFFEE PROCESSING PLANT WAS SUCCESSFULLY REPELLED.

   IT REPORTED THAT A CIVILIAN WAS KILLED IN THE CROSSFIRE AND THAT A
SOLDIER WAS ALSO KILLED DURING CLASHES IN ZARAGOZA, SOUTH OF SAN SALVADOR,
WHERE TWO GUERRILLAS WERE WOUNDED.

   THE MILITARY REPORT STATED THAT 10 REBELS WERE WOUNDED IN TECOLUCA,
SAN VICENTE DEPARTMENT, ABOUT 60 KM EAST OF THE CAPITAL, DURING AN
ARMED CLASH BETWEEN INSURGENTS AND THE 5TH [INFANTRY] BRIGADE,
HEADQUARTERED IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

   THREE OTHER SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED DURING AN FMLN AMBUSH IN GUAZAPA,
NORTH OF [SAN] SALVADOR, ONE OF THE GUERRILLAS' MAIN BASTIONS.

   THE SALVADORAN [AIR] FORCE THIS MORNING BOMBED REBEL POSITIONS IN
THE OUTSKIRTS OF JUCUAPA, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, BUT NO RESULTS ARE YET
AVAILABLE, AREA RESIDENTS TOLD ACAN-EFE.

   THE FMLN THIS MORNING HARRASSED [ARMY POSITIONS STATIONED NEAR]
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, NORTH OF [SAN] SALVADOR, WITHOUT INFLICTING ANY
CASUALTIES.

   COPREFA ALSO REPORTED THAT THE [ARMED] FORCES SEIZED FROM THE
GUERRILLAS 500 ELECTRIC CATAPULTS, IN THE NORTHERN [CHALATENANGO]
DEPARTMENT, WHICH THE FMLN HAD USED SINCE LAST YEAR TO ATTACK [SAN]
SALVADOR GARRISONS.

   SALVADORAN [RED] CROSS SOURCES TODAY REPORTED THAT A 48-YEAR-OLD
WOMAN IDENTIFIED AS MARIA LUZ LOPEZ WAS WOUNDED LAST NIGHT WHEN A
POWERFUL BOMB, WHICH DAMAGED SEVERAL BUSINESSES IN [SAN] SALVADOR,
EXPLODED.

   THE BOMB WAS PLANTED IN A HEAVILY COMMERCIAL AREA OF DOWNTOWN [SAN]
SALVADOR CAUSING HEAVY PROPERTY LOSES, ACCORDING TO THE OWNERS WHO
PROVIDED NO SPECIFIC FIGURES.

   THIS IS THE FOURTH DYNAMITE ATTACK ON BUSINESSES IN [SAN] SALVADOR
SO FAR IN 1990.

   THE GUERRILLAS INTENSIFIED THEIR ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST THE
ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM, ON 2
JANUARY WHEN AN UNILATERAL MILITARY TRUCE THEY DECREED OVER THE
CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR HOLIDAYS HAD EXPIRED.  


TST3-MUC4-0081

   LIMA, NO DATE (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [TEXT] [BEGIN RECORDING]
[LARCO COX] GOOD EVENING.  I HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE TO READ
A FOREIGN MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE: [WORDS INDISTINCT] TODAY THE PANAMANIAN
GOVERNMENT TOLD LUIS SANDIGA CABRERA, OUR CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN PANAMA,
THAT HE MUST LEAVE PANAMA IN 72 HOURS.

   2.  WE HAVE EXPRESSED TO THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE
PANAMANIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN LIMA, OUR SURPRISE AND STRONG PROTEST
OVER THAT DECISION.

   3.  IN VIEW OF THIS DECISION, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED
TO REDUCE THE PERSONNEL OF ITS DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN PANAMA AND TO
MAINTAIN ITS RELATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY AT THE FIRST SECRETARY LEVEL.
PERU WILL IN THIS WAY CONTINUE TO FULFILL THE HUMANITARIAN MISSION OF
PROTECTING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM IN ITS EMBASSY IN PANAMA WHILE
THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT ISSUES THE SAFE-CONDUCTS THAT WE REQUESTED
IN ACCORDANCE TO THE CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM SIGNED IN CARACAS
ON 28 MARCH 1954.

   PERU IS CONTACTING THE MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR
CONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT [GROUP OF EIGHT] TO EXPLAIN THE
SITUATION AND TO ASK FOR SOLIDARITY AND COOPERATION IN OVERCOMING THIS
MOMENTARY CRISIS.

   THE DELICATE SITUATION REGARDING THE PEOPLE AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY
HAS PROVOKED OUR JUSTIFIED ALARM AND IMPELLED US TO BEGIN TALKS TO
ENSURE THAT THEIR DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM WILL BE RESPECTED.  WE HAVE TALKED
WITH THE AMBASSADORS FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR
CONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT.  I HAVE PERSONALLY SPOKEN WITH
THE AMBASSADORS OF VENEZUELA, MEXICO, AND COLOMBIA.

   I AM NOW READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS:

   [REPORTER] MR LARCO COX, UNOFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE SAID THAT THE
PEOPLE IN THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA ARE NOT EXACTLY POLITICAL
REFUGEES BUT COMMON CRIMINALS.  WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THIS?

   [LARCO COX] THE COUNTRY THAT GRANTS ASYLUM DETERMINES THIS.  WE
HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO REVIEW EACH ONE OF THEM AND THEIR FILES.  WE
HAVE CHECKED TO SEE IF ANY OF THEM WERE FACING ANY TRIALS IN PANAMA OR
THE UNITED STATES.  OUR INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT NONE OF THEM
ARE FACING ANY TRIALS.  THE CHARGES WERE MADE AFTERWARD.  WE SEE THIS
AS A RESULT OF THE EMOTIONAL CLIMATE PRESENTLY EXISTING IN PANAMA.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL OPINION OF THE INCIDENT?

   [LARCO COX] IT IS THE DIPLOMATIC WAY TO EXPRESS A PROTEST OVER WHAT
THEY HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE.  ACCORDING TO PANAMANIAN REPORTS,
CHARGE D'AFFAIRES LUIS SANDIGA HAS MADE STATEMENTS ON THE SITUATION
THAT DID NOT PLEASE THE GOVERNMENT.  THE TRUTH IS THAT SANDIGA HAS NOT
MADE ANY DECLARATIONS.  HOWEVER, FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS IN
PANAMA AND HE HAS EMBARKED ON A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH HE IS SEEKING
RETALIATION AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.  HE COULD NOT THINK OF
ANYTHING BETTER THAN TO POINT AT SANDIGA AS THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR
ALLEGED STATEMENTS.  SANDIGA HAS NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT THE SITUATION
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT HIS JOB.  BESIDES, HIS CAR AND THE CAR BELONGING
TO ONE OF THE EMBASSY'S MILITARY ATTACHES HAVE BEEN STOLEN; THERE IS
NO WAY TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.

   [REPORTER] ARE YOU SAYING THAT FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS
DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SITUATION?

   [LARCO COX] YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.

   [REPORTER] IF THE SITUATION DETERIORATES, WILL PERU RECALL ALL OF
ITS PERSONNEL FROM PANAMA?

   [LARCO COX] WE CANNOT GO TO THAT EXTREME BECAUSE WE ARE FULFILLING
A HUMANITARIAN CAUSE, AS WE SAID IN THE COMMUNIQUE.  OUR FIRST
RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME IS TO SEE THAT THE RIGHT OF ASYLUM IS
RESPECTED.  AS LONG AS THE REFUGEES REMAIN IN THE EMBASSY, WE WILL
MAINTAIN OUR REPRESENTATION AT THE LEVEL OF FIRST SECRETARY. [END
RECORDING]

   BOGOTA, 24 JAN 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN LEFTIST ALLIANCE,
PATRIOTIC UNION (UP), WAS THE FIRST PARTY TO REGISTER A PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE IN THE UPCOMING 27 MAY ELECTIONS WHEN IT OFFICIALLY
REGISTERED BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, 34, AS ITS CANDIDATE TODAY.

   PRIOR TO JARAMILLO OSSA'S ARRIVAL AT THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OFFICE,
ACCOMPANIED BY 12 BODYGUARDS, EXPLOSIVES EXPERTS FROM THE SECRET
POLICE DEPARTMENT CHECKED THE BUILDING AND CORDONED OFF THE ENTRANCE
HE WAS GOING TO USE.

   UP WAS FOUNDED IN 1985 AND HAS LOST ALMOST 1,000 MEMBERS AND
REGIONAL LEADERS IN VIOLENT ATTACKS.  IT HAS ALSO LOST MOST OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES IN BOGOTA, INCLUDING JAIME PARDO LEAL, THE PARTY
FOUNDER AND A PREVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO WAS MURDERED IN
1987.

   COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY PRESIDENT GILBERTO VIEIRA AND THE ENTIRE
UP DIRECTORATE ATTENDED BERNARDO JARAMILLO'S REGISTRATION.

   LAST WEEK, THE STATE COUNCIL, COLOMBIA'S HIGHEST LEGAL AND
ADMINISTRATIVE BODY, HAD ACCREDITED BERNARDO JARAMILLO AS UP'S
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

   BEFORE MAKING HIS CANDIDACY EFFECTIVE, BERNARDO JARAMILLO TOLD EFE
THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO BECOME "THE WILL OF A WIDE AND DEMOCRATIC
SECTOR OF THE PEOPLE AND AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL COLOMBIAN
BIPARTISANSHIP."  HE ADDED: "OUR MOVEMENT WANTS TO TRANSCEND THE
LIMITS OF THE UP AND OBTAIN FOLLOWERS FROM OTHER SECTORS OF THE
DEMOCRATIC LEFT WHO SUPPORT NEW GOVERNMENT ALTERNATIVES."

   HE DID NOT REJECT THE POSSIBILITY THAT UP AND THE 19TH APRIL
MOVEMENT (M-19), A REBEL MOVEMENT THAT IS MAKING EFFORTS TO JOIN THE
COUNTRY'S LEGAL POLITICAL SYSTEM, WILL PRESENT JOINT ELECTORAL TICKETS
IN SOME REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY.

   "THERE IS NOTHING CONCRETE ON THIS," HE ADDED, "BUT IT COULD BE AN
ALTERNATIVE IF THEY PROPOSE IT."

   UP PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA STATED THAT "OUR PARTY'S MAIN OBJECTIVE
IN THESE ELECTIONS IS TO BREAK THE LIBERAL AND SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE
HEGEMONY."  THESE TWO SECTORS HAVE SHARED POWER DURING COLOMBIA'S
ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PERIOD.

   "WE PRESENT OUR CANDIDATE TO OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS WITH THE
HOPE THAT HIS CANDIDACY WILL BE BACKED AND THAT WE CAN CREATE A NEW
AND WIDER FORCE WITH POSSIBILITIES OF ATTAINING VICTORY," HE NOTED.

   JARAMILLO'S CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, "COUNTRYMEN, GIVE ME YOUR HAND"
APPEARED IN POSTERS THROUGHOUT BOGOTA TODAY.

   AFTER REGISTERING, BERNARDO JARAMILLO ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF A
FELLOW PARTY MEMBER, VLADIMIR ESCOBAR, A SOACHA MUNICIPAL OFFICIAL WHO
WAS SHOT BETWEEN THE EYES AND KILLED THIS WEEK.  THE SOACHA
MUNICIPALITY IS CLOSE TO BOGOTA.

   CLANDESTINE, 31 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT]
CONCERNING THE PROSPECTS FOR THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION BASED ON THE
MEDIATION OF UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR AND THE
DEBATE IN THE U.S.  CONGRESS ON THE AID TO EL SALVADOR, THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] REPORTS:

   1.  WE HAVE VIEWED WITH GREAT CONCERN THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMY'S REJECTION
MR PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION PROCESS AS
A MEDIATOR.  THIS ATTITUDE IS AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCESS THAT COULD FACILITATE
THE NEGOTIATION EFFORT.  ON OUR PART, WE HAVE ACCEPTED THIS MEDIATION AND WE
HAVE UNDERTAKEN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE IT.

   2. THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC
LEADER HECTOR OQUELI, THE DOUBTFUL AND INSUFFICIENT INITIAL RESULTS IN
THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ABSENCE OF CONDITIONS FOR THE
POLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSITION, THE CONTINUATION OF THE
PERSECUTION OF CHURCHES, AND THE LACK OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH THROUGH THE
DIRECT OR COVERT GAGGING OF THE PRESS SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT
IS CARRYING OUT A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION WITH ALL THE COUNTRY'S
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES.  FOR THIS REASON, THE TERMS OF THE
DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION MUST BE REORIENTED SO THAT IT WILL BE TURNED
INTO A NATIONAL PROCESS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THOSE FORCES.

   3. WE VIEW AS GRAVELY ERRONEOUS THE PERSISTENCE OF A GOVERNMENT POLICY
BASED ON THE IDEA OF THE FMLN'S ALLEGED MILITARY WEAKNESS.  THIS POSITION,
SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WAS PUT FORTH PRIOR TO 11 NOVEMBER [DATE OF THE
BEGINNING OF THE FMLN MILITARY OFFENSIVE] WILL ONLY LEAD THE COUNTRY TO
GREATER LEVELS OF CONFRONTATION.

   4. WE REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO HOLD THE MEETING OF BOTH SIDES
WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL SOON.  WE HOPE THAT MR CRISTIANI'S VISIT
TO THE UNITED NATIONS WILL LEAD TO SUCH A MEETING AND THAT WE CAN
AGREE WITH THE MEDIATOR ON THE DATE TO HOLD IT.

   5.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS
DIRECTED AGAINST DEMOCRATIZATION AND A POLITICAL SOLUTION.  THE
SENDING OF SIGNALS TO ONE OR ANOTHER SECTOR OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ARMY,
USING THE PRESSURE OF SETTING CONDITIONS OR THREATENING THE END OF
AID, DOES NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  WE BELIEVE THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S.
CONGRESS CAN MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO END THE WAR IN OUR
COUNTRY BY AGREEING TO SUSPEND THAT AID, SOMETHING WHICH COULD FORM
PART OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT THAT WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTAIL A
CEASE-FIRE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 FEB 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] IT WAS OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED
TODAY THAT SIX SALVADORAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF CLASHES
WITH SALVADORAN REBELS IN NORTHERN EL SALVADOR OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS.  MEANWHILE, IT WAS ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE REBELS ATTACKED
MILITARY POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR, BLEW UP A STORE, AND BURNED A
PUBLIC BUS.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) REPORTED THAT THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AND MEMBERS OF THE
4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE MET IN HEAVY CLASHES IN THE HAMLET OF EL ZUNGANO,
IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ON
THE AFTERNOON OF 1 FEBRUARY.  SIX SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF
THE CLASHES.  COPREFA ADDED THAT SEVERAL GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED OR
WOUNDED.

   IN ADDITION, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE FMLN, AN ARMED GROUP THAT HAS
BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS, HARASSED TWO
NATIONAL GUARD POSTS LAST NIGHT.  THE POLICE REPORTED THAT A POWERFUL
BOMB WENT OFF AT AN ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE STORE IN DOWNTOWN SAN
SALVADOR THIS MORNING, BUT CAUSING ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 10 FEB 90 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] SMARTLY DRESSED AND SPEAKING IN NEARLY PERFECT ENGLISH,
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS AGAIN VISITED THE UNITED
STATES, WHERE HE TRIED TO APPEAR AT THE CONGRESS AND THE UNITED
NATIONS AS A STATESMAN AWARE OF HIS RIGHTS.

   THIS IS, HOWEVER, A CRITICAL MOMENT FOR THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT,
AND HE KNOWS IT.  BUT THIS POINT WAS ALSO STRESSED BY THE LARGE
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO BOOED HIM AT NEARLY EVERY LARGE U.S.  CITY HE
VISITED.  ALTHOUGH THE GHOSTS OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUITS SHADOWED HIM
ALL DURING HIS TOUR, THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]
REPRESENTATIVE, JUST AS HIS PREDECESSOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE DID, FLEW
TO THE UNITED STATES TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATORS, PARTICULARLY
THE DEMOCRATS, THAT HE INTENDS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE AND
CHECK THE ARMY'S CRIMINAL ASPIRATIONS.  WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FLAG
HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR CRISTIANI, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE
HE IS AWARE THAT WITH THIS ACTION HE CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE
WASHINGTON'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT.

   ACCORDING TO TO SOME EXPERTS, CRISTIANI WENT FARTHER THAN HIS
PREDECESSOR.  HE ASKED THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO HELP IN THE
RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, REPLACED SEVERAL MILITARY
OFFICERS OF DOUBTFUL REPUTATION, AND ASSURED HE WILL PUNISH SEVERELY
EIGHT SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE
MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT, PRIOR TO HIS TRIP, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
SUCCEEDED IN CURBING A COUP ATTEMPT STAGED BY ARMY REACTIONARY GROUPS.
MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION HAVE COINCIDED IN THER VIEW THAT
NEVER BEFORE HAD A HEAD OF STATE CHALLENGED THE MILITARY HIERARCHY TO
SUCH AN EXTENT, A HIERARCHY THAT OPPOSES ALL NEGOTIATION WITH THE
GUERRILLAS.  THE EXPERTS ALSO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNTRY'S
INTERNAL SITUATION HAS NEVER BEEN SO SERIOUS.

   THE REBEL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED IN NOVEMBER IS A LANDMARK, AFTER WHICH
EVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT IN EL SALVADOR, BEGINNING WITH THE
GOVERNMENT PARTY, WHICH WAS LEFT IN A VERY DELICATE SITUATION IN THE
EYES OF INFLUENTIAL U.S. POWER CIRCLES.  THE GUERRILLA DRIVE ALSO
DEMONSTRATED THAT ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES ARE LEFT FOR THE COUNTRY.  IF
SERIOUS PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT INITIATED, THE COUNTERINSURGENCY
POLICY WILL BE AGGRAVATED. THIS COULD EVEN GIVE THE UNITED STATES A
PRETEXT TO INTERVENE DIRECTLY IN THE COUNTRY.

   ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE TO AID EL
SALVADOR, A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN
QUESTIONING WHAT USE HAS BEEN NEARLY $4 BILLION DELIVERED TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMY IN 10 YEARS OF WAR.  IF FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THE
ALTERNATIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR OR
RESIGN ITSELF TO AN EVENTUAL VICTORY OF THE REBELS, FOR CRISTIANI THE
SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE, TO GET MORE MONEY, HE MUST
ENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED.  THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO
INFLUENCING THE MOST REACTIONARY MILITARY OFFICERS AND GUARANTEEING
THE FULFILLMENT OF THE FAMOUS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN ADVOCATED BY HIS
PARTY.  THESE POINTS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH IN A COUNTRY
IMMERSED IN WAR.  IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAK, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS
EVEN WEAKER.  ANYWAY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO INCREASE AID
FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  THIS CONTRIBUTES TO PUTTING FAR INTO
THE DISTANCE ANY PLANS TO END THE WAR.

   NO CITY, NO DATE (PARIS AFP) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] "WHILE FARC COMPLIED
AND CONTINUES TO COMPLY WITH THE UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE, THE ARMY HAS BEEN
CONDUCTING MILITARY OFFENSIVES AGAINST SEVERAL FARC FRONTS, SUCH AS 1, 5,
10, 26, 38, 24, 18, 11, 23, 19, 41, 46, AND OTHERS.

   "FARC, HOWEVER, PERSISTS IN ITS EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH ITS PLEDGED
WORD, NATURALLY WITHOUT RELINQUISHING ITS LEGITIMATE DEFENSE WHEN IT
COMES TO MILITARY OPERATIONS," THE LETTER TO THE NOTABLES ADDED.

   "OUR SAYING THAT THROUGH YOU WE ARE PROPOSING TO THE GOVERNMENT A
CEASE-FIRE SO THE MARCH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS AND THE MAY PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD IN A CLIMATE OF PEACE AND DEMOCRATIC GUARANTEES
DOES NOT CHANGE OUR PREVIOUS STAND REGARDING OUR UNILATERAL
CEASE-FIRE.

   "WE ARE NOW PROPOSING THAT THIS CEASE-FIRE BE GENERAL DURING THE
ELECTIONS AND THAT THE EMINENT ADDRESSEES OF THE LETTER BECOME
SUPERVISORS OF WHAT COULD BE A NEW PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION AND PEACE
IN THE COLOMBIAN FAMILY," THE LETTER STATED.

   THE REBEL LEADERS SAID THAT, BECAUSE NEW DISAGREEMENTS AND
CONFLICTS HAVE APPEARED IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS NEVER BEFORE HEARD OF
IN THE COUNTRY, "WE ARE INSISTING ON THIS GENERAL CEASE-FIRE
PROPOSAL."

   THE LETTER SAID FURTHER: "BECAUSE, FAR FROM DIMINISHING, CRIMES
AGAINST PUBLIC ORDER, SUCH AS ABDUCTIONS, EXTORTION, AND THREATS, NOT
ONLY HAVE INCREASED IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS BUT PREVAIL IN VARIOUS
AREAS OF COLOMBIA, WE COULD HARDLY ASK THE ARMED FORCES TO STOP THEIR
FUNCTIONS OF PROTECTING THE LIVES AND PROPERTIES OF THE PEOPLE.

   "WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO CLARIFY THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE POLICE CASES AND THOSE OF PUBLIC ORDER THAT ARE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED FORCES, ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION.
SIMILARLY, WE MUST CLARIFY THAT KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION, AND THREATS
ARE NOT PART OF THE POLICY OF THE FARC STAFF.

   "WE ARE HEREBY PROPOSING TO THE EMINENT SUPERVISORS TO JOIN US IN
THE SEARCH FOR WAYS LEADING TO PEACE AND INDEPENDENT PROGRESS IN THE

   TEGUCIGALPA, 22 FEB 90 (SAN PEDRO SULA TIEMPO) -- [TEXT] CONTRA COMMANDER
ISRAEL GALEANO, ALIAS FRANKLIN, HAS TOLD TIEMPO THAT THE ANTI-SANDINIST
REBELS WILL STAY ARMED, REGARDLESS OF THE RESULTS OF THE 25 FEBRUARY
ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, TO MAKE SURE THE DEMOCRATIC CHANGES TAKE PLACE.

   "WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT EVEN IF THE UNO [NATIONAL
OPPOSITION UNION] WINS, WAITING FOR PROFOUND DEMOCRATIC CHANGES AND AN
END TO THE REPRESSIVE REGIME IMPOSED BY THE SANDINISTS," SAID THE
CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE (RN).

   THIS PAST JANUARY, THE 29-YEAR-OLD GALEANO BECAME THE LEADER OF
ABOUT 12,000 NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST REBELS BASED IN HONDURAS WHEN THE
POST OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE RN ARMY, A POST ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ HAD
HELD FOR 10 YEARS, WAS ELIMINATED.

   NICARAGUA WILL HOLD ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY, AND THE MAIN
CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ARE DANIEL ORTEGA OF THE SANDINIST
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FSLN) AND VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO OF THE UNO.

   THE REBELS, SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE URGED NICARAGUANS
TO VOTE FOR THE UNO CANDIDATE.

   "IF THE UNO WINS, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT TO SEE
IF ON 25 APRIL THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSFER OF POWER AND PROFOUND
REFORMS, AND PARTICULARLY TO SEE IF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM DISAPPEARS,"
GALEANO SAID.

   "IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR STEAL THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A
SOCIAL DISRUPTION AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND THE HARDEST STRUGGLE OF
RECENT YEARS WILL TAKE PLACE," HE ADDED.

   THE CONTRA MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT "IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT ACCEPT A
SANDINIST VICTORY, "WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE FIGHTING."

   HE ASSURED THAT THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOT ACCEPT AN FSLN VICTORY IN
THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS.

   GALEANO ADDED THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED APPROXIMATELY
30,000 TROOPS IN THE NORTHERN NICARAGUAN DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO
"INTIMIDATE AND MURDER" UNO FOLLOWERS AND TO PREVENT APPROXIMATELY
300,000 NICARAGUANS FROM VOTING.

   GALEANO POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESS AND THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS OF THE
ELECTIONS HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE AREAS WHERE THE NICARAGUAN TROOPS HAVE
DEPLOYED.

   "EVEN THOUGH THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS CLAIM THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS
FREELY HELD, THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE SACRIFICES," HE SAID.

   GALEANO SAID THAT ABOUT 5,000 OF HIS MEN ARE INSIDE NICARAGUA, AND
BETWEEN 10,000 TO 12,000 MEN ARE IN BASES IN HONDURAS, "NOT MOVING,
BUT JUST OBSERVING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS" IN NICARAGUA.

   THE REBELS IN HONDURAS ARE RECEIVING U.S. HUMANITARIAN AID IN EL
PARAISO DEPARTMENT AND HAVE REJECTED A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN APPROVED BY
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  THE REBELS CLAIM THEY DO NOT HAVE
ANY GUARANTEES FOR THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY AND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION
OF A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   "THE DEMOBILIZATION IS BASED ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CREATING
CONDITIONS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED RN TO JOIN
CIVIC LIFE," HE ADDED.

   GALEANO SAID THAT THE DISMANTLING OF HIS FORCES DOES NOT "DEPEND OF
A SIMPLE ELECTIONS," BUT RATHER ON "THE SANDINISTS LEAVING POWER
COMPLETELY."

   THE CONTRA LEADER WARNED THAT "WE CANNOT LAY DOWN OUR WEAPONS WHEN
THE CAUSES THAT LED TO OUR TAKING UP ARMS HAVE NOT DISAPPEARED.  THERE
STILL IS REPRESSION, A LACK OF FREEDOM, AND ALL OF THIS WAS GENERATED
BY THE SANDINISTS."

   HE POINTED OUT THAT IN THE EVENT THE UNO SHOULD WIN THE 25 FEBRUARY
ELECTIONS, "WE WOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT A MUTUAL DEMOBILIZATION.  THE
NICARAGUAN PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED WITH AN INTER-AMERICAN PEACE FORCE
THAT WILL RECEIVE ALL THE WEAPONRY AND SOVIET TANKS OF THE SANDINISTS.
THEN, WHEN WE ARE AT AN EVEN LEVEL OF FORCES, WE WILL TURN OVER OUR
OWN WEAPONS."

   THE CONTRA CHIEF SUGGESTED A NATIONAL POLICE BE CREATED IN
NICARAGUA.

   FRANKLIN SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE PEACE
TALKS, BUT PERHAPS AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT.

   HE ASSURED THAT THE REBEL FORCES WILL NOT CARRY OUT "ANY OFFENSIVE
OPERATIONS BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER THE ELECTIONS, AND WILL WAIT AND
SEE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN NICARAGUA."

   HE SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THEIR CAMPS IN
YAMALES IF REQUESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS.

   "IF POLITICAL CONDITIONS DO NOT ALLOW US TO REMAIN, WE WILL LEAVE
(FOR NICARAGUA), BUT OUR REFUGEEES WILL STAY, AS REFUGEES," HE ADDED.

   THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE CONTRAS SAID THAT HIS FORCES WILL NOT
ATTACK THE UN PEACE OBSERVERS IN THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER AREA.

   HE SAID THAT RN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES ARE NORMAL, BUT
DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE OUSTING OF BERMUDEZ, ARGUING THAT THIS IS A
FAIT ACCOMPLI.

   BOGOTA, 24 FEB 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] CALM APPEARS TO BE
RETURNING TO THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF ONE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER
AND SIX SOLDIERS ON 23 FEBRUARY AS A RESULT OF GUERRILLA ATTACKS IN FIVE
ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT MUNICIPALITIES, THE KIDNAPPING OF A MAYOR, A GOVERNMENT
OFFICIAL, AND A CANDIDATE IN CAUCA DEPARTMENT, AND THE DEATH OF A GUERRILLA
IN GUAVIARE.

   THE GUERRILLA ACTIONS BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 22 FEBRUARY WHEN A
LARGE COLUMN OF THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY [ELN] ENTERED TURBO
MUNICIPALITY, NORTHEAST OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, AND SABOTAGED THE
POWER SYSTEM LEAVING THE ENTIRE AREA WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.  NATIONAL
ARMY SPOKESMEN SAID THAT ONE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER AND SIX SOLDIERS
WERE KILLED, FOUR WERE WOUNDED, AND 15 OTHERS WERE KIDNAPPED DURING
THE ATTACKS AGAINST MILITARY BASES AND POLICE INSTALLATIONS IN SEGOVIA
BY THE 4TH FRONT OF THE FARC [REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA].

   MEANWHILE IN BOGOTA, MILITARY FORCES COMMANDER NELSON MEJIA HENAO
DENIED THAT COLOMBIA IS IN GUERRILLA HANDS AND REAFFIRMED THE TROOPS'
UNYIELDING DETERMINATION TO DEFEND NATIONAL ORDER AND DEMOCRACY.  THE
HIGHEST-RANKING OFFICER, WHO EXPRESSED REGRET OVER THE DEATHS OF THE
SOLDIERS IN SEGOVIA, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, SAID THAT THIS TYPE OF
INCIDENT IS NORMAL WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE WAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT
IS WAGING AGAINST ARMED SUBVERSION.

   LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS, AFTER THE CLOSING
CEREMONY OF THE 25TH AGRARIAN CONGRESS OF THE (FAC) [EXPANSION
UNKNOWN], SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE DESPERATE AND THIS IS REFLECTED
IN THEIR ACTIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, THE ARMED FORCES WILL CONTINUE TO
FIGHT SUBVERSION ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY, HE ADDED.  THE PRESIDENT
EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION AT THE RELEASE OF SANTANDER DEPARTMENT
SENATOR JORGE SERRANO GONZALEZ, WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAT COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY HAS AT THIS MOMENT.  HE
ADDED FINALLY: I HOPE THAT IS HE ALREADY AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY.

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS ITS STANCE
REGARDING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS AND ITS RESUMPTION.  WE BELIEVE IT
CONSTITUTES THE MOST EXPEDIENT WAY TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE COUNTRY,
AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ALONG THAT PATH.

   [MODERATOR] AIDA MONTALVO.

   [MONTALVO] IN REGARD TO THE RENEGOTIATION OF THE FOREIGN DEBT, WHEN
ARE YOU PLANNING TO GO TO MEXICO, AND HOW WILL THE SALVADORAN DEBT
WITH THAT COUNTRY BE RENEGOTIATED?

   [CRISTIANI] THE TIMETABLE FOR THE TRIP IS STILL UNDECIDED.  THERE
IS NOT DEFINITE DATE.  I THINK IT MAY TAKE PLACE IN APRIL OR MAY OF
THIS YEAR.  OUR FIRST SCHEDULED VISIT WILL BE TO VENEZUELA.

   [MODERATOR] CARLOS MARIO MARQUEZ OF AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE.

   [MARQUEZ] [WORDS INDISTINCT] SOCIAL ASPECTS.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT THE STATUS IS OF THAT, SINCE SOME SUPPORT HAVING PRIMARY MEETINGS
AND THEN A SUMMIT, SO TO SPEAK?

   [CRISTIANI] I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE CAUSE OF THAT PROBLEM.  WE
SAID THAT THE RESUMPTION OF THE TALKS MUST TAKE PLACE WHEN THE FMLN
ENTERS THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH A SERIOUS ATTITUDE.  WE MAINTAIN OUR
STANCE THAT THEY MUST STOP ALL VIOLENCE THAT IS DIRECTLY AND
INDIRECTLY AFFECTING CIVILIANS, THAT IS, ALL THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES
THE FMLN CONDUCTS.  THIS IS A SMALL REQUEST THAT OBTAINED THE SUPPORT
OF ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AT THE SAN ISIDRO CORONADO
MEETING IN COSTA RICA.

   I THINK THAT THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  THEY HAVE ASKED FOR
CHANGES IN FORMAT, AND WE SAID WE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH MOST OF THE
REQUESTS WE HAVE RECEIVED.  WE ARE NOW WAITING FOR THE FMLN, SINCE
THEY ASKED FOR TIME TO ANALYZE THINGS A LITTLE BEFORE HAVING THE
MEETING.  WE ARE AWAITING THE VISIT OF MR. DE SOTO IN EARLY MARCH.
OBVIOUSLY, THE DIALOGUE HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME
DIFFERENCES, [WORDS INDISTINCT].  I THINK THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE IS THAT
THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT TO AGREE TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIONS, AND THAT IS
WHY THERE IS NO DIALOGUE NOW.

   [MODERATOR] EPIGMENIO IBARRA.

   [IBARRA] MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY IN NICARAGUA, DANIEL ORTEGA SAID
AT A RALLY THAT HE WILL WAGE A CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION.  HE SAID THAT
THE REVOLUTION DID NOT DIE WITH THE ELECTIONS.  HE SAID THAT THE
SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FSLN] WILL RULE FROM BELOW.  WE
SENSE A PRETTY COMPLEX CLIMATE FOR THE TRANSITION IN NICARAGUA.  WHAT
DO YOU THINK ABOUT DANIEL ORTEGA'S STATEMENTS?  HOW DO YOU VIEW THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MAY BE A TRUE TRANSITION FROM POWER TO POWER
INSTEAD OF A TRANSITION OF GOVERNMENT IN NICARAGUA?

   [CRISTIANI] AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, STATEMENTS BY ORTEGA AND OTHER
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SANDINIST FRONT ARE A SOURCE OF CONCERN.  THEY
COULD INDICATE THAT THE ELECTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN VERY FREE AND HONEST,
BUT ALSO A FARCE AS FAR AS IMPROVING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS
CONCERNED.  THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WOULD BE DENIED THE RIGHT TO FREELY
PICK THEIR RULERS AND THE RIGHT OF THESE RULERS TO ACT AS THEY DEEM
BEST.  I WOULD SAY THAT THE NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION BELONGS NOT JUST TO
THE FSLN.  THE FSLN WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVOLUTION IN
NICARAGUA AGAINST ANASTASIO SOMOZA.  THE FACT IS THAT A CONSENSUS
EXISTED AMONG ALL SECTORS THAT SUPPORTED THAT REVOLUTION.  THE FSLN
HAS NO MONOPOLY ON OR EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER THAT REVOLUTION.

   I BELIEVE THAT IN IDEOLOGICAL TERMS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
THE VIEWS OF MS. CHAMORRO AND UNO [NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION], THAT
IS, THE NEW GOVERNMENT-ELECT, AND THE VIEWS OF THE FSLN.  YET, THE
PEOPLE PICKED THE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS WORRISOME TO HEAR SOME STATEMENTS
THAT THE FSLN WILL RULE FROM BELOW.  WE BELIEVE THEY WOULD SEEK TO DO
THAT BY KEEPING CONTROL OVER THE ARMY.  LET ME REPEAT: THERE IS
NOTHING DEMOCRATIC ABOUT A POLITICAL PARTY CONTROLLING THE ARMY.  THE
ARMY MUST RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS, AND NOT TO JUST ONE POLITICAL PARTY.  WE BELIEVE THINGS HAVE
NOT BEEN SETTLED YET.  WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE STILL MANY THINGS
LEFT PENDING.  [CONTINUED]

   GUATEMALA CITY, 6 MAR 90 (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE
EMBASSY COMMUNIQUE POINTS OUT THAT THE UNITED STATES DID NOT SUBMIT EITHER
ONE OF THE TWO HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTIONS ON GUATEMALA THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER
DISCUSSION IN GENEVA.  ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVERS, THIS CLARIFICATION CAME
IN REPLY TO STATEMENTS MADE BY CEREZO THAT THE U.S. POSITION IN THIS REGARD
DIFFERS FROM THAT OF MOST COUNTRIES WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] ALL THESE ACTIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE
UNITED STATES POINTING THE FINGER TO HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES ARE AIMED AT
[WORD INDISTINCT] IN GENEVA, BECAUSE I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT WHAT
IT WANTS AT THIS TIME IS TO HAVE GUATEMALA CONDEMNED AND TO A CERTAIN
EXTENT TARNISH OUR INTERNATIONAL IMAGE, BECAUSE THE SUCCESS OF THE
ESQUIPULAS II PLAN GAVE GUATEMALA, AS AN AUTONOMOUS AND INDEPENDENT
COUNTRY, A LOT OF ROOM FOR ACTION.

   THAT IS WHAT IT WANTS TO DO, BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOOD FOR LARGE
COUNTRIES TO SEE COUNTRIES LIKE GUATEMALA, WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF
AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE, ACHIEVE HISTORIC SUCCESSES BY SHOWING THAT
OUR COUNTRY IS RIGHT IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CERTAIN U.S. GROUPS.  THEY
NOW WANT [WORDS INDISTINCT].  MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT THEY NOW
SORT OF WANT TO GET BACK AT US FOR THE ESQUIPULAS II PLAN.  [END
RECORDING]

   IN REPLY TO THESE STATEMENTS BY PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE U.S. EMBASSY
POINTED OUT IN ITS COMMUNIQUE OF 6 MARCH THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD
SUPPORTED THE ESQUIPULAS II PEACE PROCESS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.  IT
ADDED THAT EVER SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE ESQUIPULAS ACCORD, GUATEMALA
HAS RECEIVED $600 MILLION IN U.S. AID.  THIS SHOWS, ACCORDING TO THE
EMBASSY, THAT U.S. SUPPORT FOR GUATEMALAN DEMOCRACY CONTINUED TO BE
STRONG AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENT.

   IN ANY CASE, FROM PRESIDENT CEREZO'S PERSPECTIVE THE U.S.  ATTITUDE
IN THIS SITUATION REFLECTS THE TRADITIONAL INCLINATION OF THAT
COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT HISTORY TO DICTATE RULES TO OTHER
NATIONS REGARDING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO.  CEREZO COMPARED GUATEMALA'S
SITUATION IN MATTERS OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TO THE SITUATION IN
SEVERAL U.S. CITIES WHERE THE POLICE ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL CRIME.  AS
AN EXAMPLE, HE CITED WASHINGTON, D.C., WHERE ASSAULTS, MURDERS, AND
CRIMES FREQUENTLY RELATED TO DRUG CONSUMPTION HAVE REACHED VERY
ASTONISHING LEVELS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

   AS FOR THE DEPARTURE OF AMBASSADOR STROOK, CEREZO SAID THAT THE
DIPLOMAT HAS NOT BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM GUATEMALA, BUT RETURNED TO THE
UNITED STATES FOR CONSULTATIONS BY ORDER OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT.  IN
STATEMENTS MADE MINUTES AFTER RECEIVING THE CREDENTIALS OF THE NEW FRG
AMBASSADOR, HOWEVER, CEREZO SAID THAT HIS RETURN WAS, TO A CERTAIN
EXTENT, DUE TO A DECISION WE MADE.

   SANTIAGO, 21 MAR 90 (RADIO CHILENA NETWORK) -- [EXCERPTS] GENERAL
GUSTAVO LEIGH GUZMAN, A FORMER MILITARY REGIME GOVERNMENT JUNTA MEMBER AND
FORMER COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE AIR FORCE, AND AIR FORCE GENERAL ENRIQUE
RUIZ, RETIRED, A PARTNER IN LEIGH'S REAL ESTATE OFFICE, WERE SERIOUSLY
INJURED DURING AN ATTACK THIS MORNING.

   ACCORDING TO WITNESSES' REPORTS, TWO 23 TO 25-YEAR-OLD INDIVIDUALS
WALKED TO GEN. LEIGH'S OFFICE, ON THE FOURTH FLOOR OF THE BUILDING
LOCATED AT 95 LUIS TALLE OJEDA STREET.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   WITNESSES SAID THEY HEARD TWO BURSTS OF GUNFIRE: ONE BURST OF THREE
SHOTS LASTING THREE SECONDS AND ANOTHER BURST OF SEVEN TO EIGHT SHOTS
LASTING LONGER.  GEN. LEIGH'S SECRETARY, JOANNA SANTIS RETAMAL, CAME
TO A WINDOW TO REPORT THE INCIDENT.

   OTHER REPORTS SAID THAT THE TWO INDIVIDUALS BROKE INTO THE OFFICES
AND ENTERED GEN. LEIGH'S PRIVATE OFFICE.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE INDIVIDUALS USED 9 MM SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOLS.  ACCORDING TO THE
EXPERTS, GEN. RUIZ WAS HIT THREE TIMES AND GEN GUSTAVO LEIGH WAS HIT
FIVE TIMES.  THE BULLETS HIT GEN. LEIGH IN HIS EYE, NOSE, RIGHT ARM,
RIGHT LEG, AND STOMACH.

   THE TWO ATTACKERS THEN WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS AND ESCAPED TOWARD
PROVIDENCIA.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS STRONG CONDEMNATION OF THE ATTACK
ON GEN. GUSTAVO LEIGH, THE FORMER COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE AIR FORCE
AND MEMBER OF THE MILITARY REGIME'S GOVERNMENT JUNTA.  ON HIS WAY TO
THE HOSPITAL ON EXPRESS ORDERS OF THE PRESIDENT, INTERIOR MINISTER
ENRIQUE KRAUSS REJECTED THE ATTACK:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [KRAUSS] WE HAVE ASKED THE POLICE AUTHORITIES TO
FULLY CLARIFY THIS INCIDENT.  THESE ATTITUDES AND ACTS DO NOT HELP IN
THE EFFORT REQUIRED TO REUNITE ALL CHILEANS.  [END RECORDING]

   KRAUSS SAID IT WAS A REGRETTABLE INCIDENT BECAUSE IT HURT THE
SPIRIT AND PURPOSE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION'S WORK.  THE
ATTACK AGAINST LEIGH WOULD MAKE A GOOD PATHOLOGICAL STUDY, THE
MINISTER ADDED.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS HAS SAID
THE ATTACK ON GUSTAVO LEIGH DOES NOT REFLECT THE CURRENT SITUATION IN
THE COUNTRY.  COMMUNIST PARTY LEADER JORGE MARTINEZ, MOVEMENT OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY LEFT [MIR] LEADER CARLOS RUIG, AND MANUEL RODRIGUEZ
PATRIOTIC FRONT [FPMR] LEADER FRANCISCO ESCOBAR HEARD THE NEWS WHILE
HOLDING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE PRISON HOUSE.

   THE FPMR'S FRANCISCO ESCOBAR SAID HE IS SURE HIS ORGANIZATION WAS
NOT INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT BECAUSE, AS HE SAID, WE ARE NOT GOING TO
ACHIEVE ANYTHING WITH IT.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   MIR REPRESENTATIVE CARLOS RUIG SAID THAT THE MIR WOULD NOT CARRY
OUT ANY ARMED ACTION AT THIS TIME, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE LEVEL OF GEN.
LEIGH'S INVOLVEMENT IN PAST REPRESSIONS.

   COMMUNIST LEADER JORGE MARTINEZ SAID THAT HE IS COMMITTED TO
RESPECTING THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION.  HE SAID THAT HE DOES NOT
BELIEVE THAT THIS TYPE OF ACTION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE COUNTRY'S
PROGRESS AND STABILITY.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 21 MAR 90 (CRITICA LIBRE) -- [ARTICLE]
[JUSTINO GONZALEZ JR.] [TEXT] THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO
FACE A RUPTURE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MEXICO AND PERU TO ENFORCE
THE LAW, FOREIGN MINISTER DR. JULIO E. LINARES ASSERTED WHEN REFERRING
TO FORMER COLLABORATORS OF FORMER GENERAL NORIEGA WHO SOUGHT SHELTER
IN THESE EMBASSIES SEVERAL WEEKS AGO.

   THE MEXICAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS
GRANTED DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM TO RAFAEL AROSEMENA, FORMER MANAGER OF THE
NATIONAL BANK OF PANAMA.  HOWEVER, THE PANAMANIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE
CONFIRMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT GRANT HIM A SAFECONDUCT TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY, AND THEY SENT A NOTE TO THE MEXICAN EMBASSY URGING IT TO
DESIST FROM OFFERING HIM PROTECTION.

   ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, RAFAEL AROSEMENA IS
INVOLVED IN AUTHORIZING THE PAYMENT OF CHECKS FOR $12 MILLION, MADE
OUT TO CASH BY FORMER COLONEL MARCOS JUSTINES.  MEANWHILE, HERACLIDES
SUCRE AND GONZALO GONZALEZ, FORMER MAJORS IN THE NOW DEFUNCT DEFENSE
FORCES, HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY.
THEY ARE ACCUSED OF KILLING MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI, WHO LED THE FOILED
COUP D'ETAT AGAINST NORIEGA IN OCTOBER 1989.

   "WE ARE WILLING TO PAY WHATEVER PRICE IS NECESSARY TO ENFORCE THE
LAW, BECAUSE THESE POLITICAL REFUGEES ARE COMMON CRIMINALS AND THEY
HAVE NO RIGHT TO THAT BENEFIT," LINARES STATED WHEN ASKED BY CRITICA
LIBRE IF PANAMA WOULD BE WILLING TO STOP THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT
ASYLUM AT THE MEXICAN AND PERUVIAN EMBASSIES FROM LEAVING THE COUNTRY
WITHOUT FACING A TRIAL FOR THE CRIMES THEY REPORTEDLY PERPETRATED
DURING THE PREVIOUS REGIME.

   LINARES SAID THAT PANAMA WILL MAINTAIN ITS POSITION OF NOT GRANTING
SAFE-CONDUCTS TO THESE REFUGEES, EVEN IF THE MEXICAN AND PERUVIAN
GOVERNMENT INSIST ON GRANTING THEM DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM, AND ADMITTED
THAT THIS WILL LIKELY CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT.

   NEVERTHELESS, LINARES SAID THAT HE HOPES THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO
BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH EITHER OF THESE COUNTRIES, WHICH
INSIST ON KEEPING FORMER COLLABORATORS OF FORMER GEN NORIEGA AS
REFUGEES, AND HE EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING WITH
THESE NATIONS.

   "WE HOPE THAT RELATIONS WITH MEXICO WILL NOT COOL OFF OR REACH A
BREAKING POINT GIVEN THE AFFECTION THAT UNITES US AS FREE NATIONS,"
LINARES ADDED.

   HE REVEALED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY SENT A NOTE TO THE PANAMANIAN
GOVERNMENT STATING THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE DIPLOMATI PROTECTION
TO THE REFUGEES IN ITS EMBASSY, BECAUSE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WERE STARTED
AGAINST THEM AFTER THEY HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE DIPLOMATIC MISSION.

   "WE ARE PREPARING A NOTE OF REPLY TO THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT,"
FOREIGN MINISTER LINARES SAID.

   THE FOLLOWING PERSONS ARE STILL REFUGEES AT THE ECUADORAN EMBASSY:
FORMER PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER RENE BULTRON, FORMER LABOR MINISTER CESAR
MARTANS, FORMER NATIONAL MORTGAGE BANK MANAGER JULIO SHAIK, FORMER
IRHE [INSTITUTE OF HYDRAULIC RESOURCES AND ELECTRIFICATION] DIRECTOR
LEOVIGILDO HERRRERA, AND FORMER TOURISM DIRECTOR BERNARDO DOMINGUEZ.

   LAST WEEK THE FOREIGN MINISTER REVIEWED THE POSSIBILITY OF GRANTING
SAFE-CONDUCTS TO FIVE OF THESE FORMER OFFICIALS IN THE PREVIOUS
REGIME, PROVIDED THERE IS NO CASE PENDING AGAINST THEM.  ACCORDING TO
THE OFFICIAL, THESE REFUGEES FACE CHARGES FOR PLOTTING AGAINST THE
STATE'S SECURITY, A POLITICAL CRIME.

   REFERRING TO THE CASE OF FORMER LEGISLATOR LUIS GOMEZ, WHO SOUGHT
ASYLUM AT THE CUBAN EMBASSY, LINARES SAID THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE AN
EVALUATION.

   BOGOTA, 23 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [REPORT] [ORLANDO
GUERRERO] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING, A COMMUNIQUE HAS JUST BEEN ISSUED AT
THE NATIONAL CAPITOL.  THE COMMUNIQUE HAS BEEN SIGNED BY ALL THE
DEMOCRATIC FORCES OF THE COUNTRY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LIBERAL
PARTY.  THE COMMUNIQUE ASKS THE GOVERNMENT TO OFFER FULL GUARANTEES
DURING THE ELECTIONS PROCESS AND TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS.  THE
FOLLOWING IS THE COMMUNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED IN THE ELIPTICO ROOM
OF THE NATIONAL CAPITOL:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] WE REPORT TO THE
COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THE FOLLOWING:

   1. WE ONCE AGAIN CONDEMN THE VILE MURDER OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
DR. BERNARDO JARAMILLO.  THIS MURDER HAS MADE EVIDENT THE LACK OF
GUARANTEES IN THE COUNTRY, GUARANTEES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS
SYSTEMATICALLY DENIED THE OPPOSITION PARTIES.  WE REJECT THE
MANIPULATIONS IN WHICH OFFICIAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENGAGED IN
CONNECTION WITH INVESTIGATING THIS CRIME.

   2. WE DENOUNCE THAT THE OFFICIAL APPARATUS IS AT THE SERVICE OF
ONLY ONE CANDIDATE AND THAT IT IS PREPARED TO ESTABLISH PARTY
PREDOMINANCE THAT WOULD IN PRACTICE BE A REJECTION OF DEMOCRATIC
PLURALISM.

   3. WE DEMAND FULL GUARANTEES FOR ALL THE FORCES PARTICIPATING IN
THE ELECTIONS AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE STATE MEDIA SO THAT THESE
FORCES CAN MAKE KNOWN THEIR POLITICAL POSITIONS.

   4. WE REQUEST GUARANTEES THAT THE NEW ELECTORAL SYSTEM WILL NOT
HAVE THE SAME DIFFICULTIES THAT EXISTED DURING THE 11 MARCH ELECTIONS,
THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE STILL UNKNOWN.

   5. UNDER THE CURRENT CONDITIONS, WE ASK OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE
NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL TO ABSTAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN
DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS OF THAT COUNCIL.

   6. IN VIEW OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE HAVE AGREED TO TEMPORARILY
SUSPEND OUR ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND DEMAND A POSTPONEMENT OF THE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 27 MAY.

   7. WE INSIST THAT THE RATIFICATION OF CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS IN THE
GOVERNMENT MINISTRY REPRESENTS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO THE DEMOCRATIC
OPPOSITION TO FINDING AN INSTITUTIONAL INTERLOCUTOR IN NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT.

   8. WE ANNOUNCE THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL [WORDS
INDISTINCT] TO VERIFY THAT THE ELECTORAL GUARANTEES WE ARE DEMANDING
ARE GRANTED AND TO OBSERVE THE ELECTIONS PROCESS.

   9. THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE OF THE OPPOSITION HEREBY STATES ITS
DECISION TO WORK FOR THE FORMATION OF A CONSTITUENT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
THAT MUST HAVE A DEMOCRATIC AND PLURALISTIC COMPOSITION WITH THE
DECIDING PARTICIPATION OF THE NATIONAL [WORD INDISTINCT] TO APPROVE A
NEW CONSTITUTION AND TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD FINDING POLITICAL SOLUTIONS
TO THE SOCIAL CONFLICT OF COLOMBIA.  WE APPEAL TO THE LEADERS OF THE
COUNTRY TO URGE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND AND RESPECT HUMAN
RIGHTS.

   10. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION THAT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE ARMED
CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY IS A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   11. WE URGE THE LIBERAL PARTY TO POSTPONE ITS NATIONAL CONVENTION
IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE PATRIOTIC UNION AND THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.

   12. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S CALL AND WE WILL PROMOTE
THIS CALL THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE.

   13. IN DEFENSE OF A PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACY WE WILL MAINTAIN THE
PERMANENT COMMITTEE OF THE OPPOSITION WE HAVE CREATED.  WE HEREBY ASK
OUR FOLLOWERS AND ALL OUR COUNTRYMEN TO REMAIN ON A STATE OF ALERT.

   THIS COMMITTEE WILL HOLD A NEW MEETING TUESDAY 27 MARCH, AT 1500,
IN THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES.  WE URGE ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL
FORCES INTERESTED IN THESE OBJECTIVES TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THIS
MEETING.

   RESOLUTION;

   DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, THE POPULAR MOVEMENT [WORDS INDISTINCT], THE
BROAD FRONT [WORDS INDISTINCT], THE NATIONALIST ACTION FOR PEACE, AND
THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT [M-19] WANT TO LEAVE ON RECORD THE FOLLOWING:

   THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS BETWEEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND M-19
THAT BEGAN ON 10 JANUARY 1989 AND THAT PRODUCED ON 9 MARCH 1990 A
PEACE AGREEMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE MURDER OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO,
BUT WILL NOT RESULT IN AN END TO THE SEARCH FOR PEACE BY THE TWO
PARTIES.

   WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED
CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA.  [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 APR 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT-REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT] TERRORIST
GROUPS HAVE CONTINUED THEIR TREACHEROUS ATTACKS AGAINST CIVILIANS AND POLICE
OFFICERS IN THE CAPITAL AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE, OPENLY IGNORING THE
AGREEMENTS REACHED BY THEIR LEADERS WITH A GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IN GENEVA,
SWITZERLAND.

   THE ARMED FORCES TELECOMMUNICATIONS INSTRUCTION CENTER (CITFA)
REPORTED THAT A MAN AND A WOMAN WERE CRITICALLY WOUNDED WHEN THE
VEHICLE IN WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELLING NEAR OLOCUILTA, LA PAZ
DEPARTMENT, WAS MACHINEGUNNED BY FMLN TERRORISTS ON THE EVENING OF 4
APRIL.

   THE WOUNDED ARE MAURICIO CAMPOS AND CONCEPCION HERRERA, WHO WERE
TAKEN TO A HEALTH CENTER BY THE RED CROSS, THE SOURCES ADDED.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THAT TWO OF ITS AGENTS AND A CIVILIAN
WERE FIRED AT BY TERRORISTS AT 1800 ON 4 APRIL, AS THEY INSPECTED A
CAR CRASH BETWEEN THE HIGHWAY TO COMALAPA AIRPORT AND 49TH SOUTH
AVENUE IN THE MONTSERRAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

   "THE POLICEMEN WERE MACHINEGUNNED DOWN BY PEOPLE IN A MOVING
VEHICLE AND SUSTAINED WOUNDS WHICH HAVE LEFT THEM IN EXTREMELY
CRITICAL CONDITION," A SECURITY CORPS SPOKESMAN SAID.

   THE TWO AGENTS WERE ASSISTED BY PEOPLE WHO REPUDIATED THE ATTACK.

   A PEDESTRIAN, LATER IDENTIFIED AS MANUEL ALVARO MENDOZA, WAS ALSO
STRUCK BY THE BULLET AND HE IS AT ROSALES HOSPITAL.

   A MILITARY SPOKESMAN ALSO REPORTED THAT A GROUP OF PERSONS WHO

WHEN TERRORISTS THREW A BOMB AT CIVIL DEFENSE MEMBERS IN NEJAPA, NORTH
OF SAN SALVADOR, WHILE HARASSING THE PARAMILITARY GROUP'S OUTPOST.
THE BOY IS AT BLOOM HOSPITAL.

   IN THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION AND THE FMLN-FDR
LEADERS, THE LATTER PLEDGED NOT TO ENGAGE IN TERRORISTS ATTACKS THAT MIGHT
DAMAGE ASSETS OR INJURE PERSONS, BUT "URBAN COMMANDOS" OR "TERRORISTS
SQUADS" THAT OPERATE IN SAN SALVADOR HAVE EITHER NOT BEEN INFORMED OF THIS
RESOLUTION OR THEY ACT INDEPENDENTLY, THE MILITARY SOURCES SAID.

   REFERRING TO THE 2 APRIL CAR BOMB EXPLOSION PERPETRATED IN SANTA
TECLA, THE FMLN-FDR CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK IN A
COMMUNIQUE, AND SAID THAT IT WAS "AN ACTION AIMED DIRECTLY AT THE
POLICE" AND THAT "THEY REGRET THE DEATH OF A CIVILIAN," BUT THEY DID
NOT MENTION COMPENSATION FOR THE RELATIVES.

   ALSO, THE FMLN-FDR CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK ON GENERAL
RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS'S SON-IN-LAW, ACCUSING HIM OF BEING A MILITARY
PILOT -- WHEN IN FACT HE HAS BEEN A CIVILIAN PILOT AND HE WAS WORKING
IN A SMALL AUTOMOBILE SPARE PARTS DISTRIBUTION COMPANY AT THE TIME OF
THE ATTACK.

   THE YOUNG MAN, OTTO MILLA, IS STILL IN A COMA AND HIS PANCREAS WAS
REMOVED IN THE LATEST SURGICAL OPERATION.

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] GOOD AFTERNOON, WE
HAVE JUST RECEIVED A STATEMENT ISSUED BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS
CONCERNING THE MURDER OF MR.  CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ.  THE MESSAGE READS AS
FOLLOWS:

   CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER IS A MONSTROUS CRIME THAT HAS CUT SHORT THE
LIFE OF A MAN WHO HAD SHOWN HIS WILL FOR PEACE AND HIS COMMITMENT TO
COLOMBIA.  THE CRIME WAS DIRECTED AT HINDERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
ELECTORAL PROCESS AND DESTROYING THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS THAT THE
GOVERNMENT AND M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED,
SURPASSING MANY OBSTACLES.  IN THIS CASE, AS IN MANY OTHERS, THIS
PAINFUL TRAGEDY SHOULD SERVE TO CONSOLIDATE THE IDEALS OF PEACE AND
PLURALISM FOR WHICH SO MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE STRUGGLED -- ONE OF THEM,
CARLOS PIZARRO.  IT SHOULD SERVE TO REASSERT OUR REPUDIATION OF
VIOLENCE AND OUR FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES.

   FURTHER ON THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE NOTES:

   PIZARRO'S RELATIVES AND HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT, AND
I PERSONALLY, FEEL STRONG WRATH AND SADNESS, BUT WE WILL NOT BE
DISCOURAGED.  WE WILL UPHOLD THE BANNERS OF RECONCILIATION, PLURALISM,
AND THE RIGHT TO FREELY AND PEACEFULLY EXPRESS ANY IDEA.  WE WILL ALSO
CONTINUE TO UNMASK AND COMBAT ENEMIES OF PEACE.

   THE PRESIDENT ADDS IN HIS MESSAGE:

   I INTERPRET THE DESIRE OF ALL COLOMBIANS WHO ADMIRED CARLOS
PIZARRO'S DEMOCRATIC VOCATION, BY WARNING THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS TRAGIC MURDER THAT THEY WILL NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY WHAT HAS
BEEN WORKED FOR SO HARD AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF POLITICAL FORCES AND
THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR PEACE ON 11 MARCH TO OPEN A ROAD FOR PEACE
THAT IS CLEAR, POSSIBLE, AND DEFINED.

   THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE CONTINUES:

   YOU KNOW THAT DURING THIS PEACE PROCESS, MANY ENEMIES AND
DIFFICULTIES WERE SURPASSED, BUT NONE HAS BEEN SO LARGE AS THIS
TRAGEDY THAT HAS SHAKEN ALL COLOMBIANS.  THE OBLIGATION THAT LIES
BEFORE US IS TO KEEP OPEN THE ROAD TO PEACE THAT THE MURDERERS OF
CARLOS PIZARRO WANT TO DESTROY.  ARTICLE 95 OF THE ELECTORAL CODE
INDICATES THAT WHEN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DIES, ANOTHER PERSON IN
HIS OWN MOVEMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO TAKE HIS PLACE.  IN COMPLIANCE WITH
THIS NORM, THE GOVERNMENT WILL OFFER EVERY FACILITY FOR THE REGISTRY
OF A NEW M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SO THAT HE CAN CONTINUE TO HOIST
THE FLAGS OF PEACE AND PLURALISM AS IS PROPER FOR A DEMOCRATIC DEBATE.

   THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAYS IN HIS MESSAGE:

   I HAVE ASKED THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND THE PEACE ADVISER TO MEET
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH M-19 REPRESENTATIVES SO THAT TOGETHER THEY
MAY STUDY ALTERNATIVES TO CONFRONT SUCH A SERIOUS SITUATION. AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER WILL ALSO DIRECT CONTACTS WITH
THE REST OF THE POLITICAL FORCES TO REQUEST THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT THE
PRESENT SITUATION AND TO CONTINUE TO GIVE ALL THE NECESSARY GUARANTEES
SO THAT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS MAY DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHAT IS
ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND OUR LAWS.

   THE MESSAGE ENDS:

   I INVITE ALL COLOMBIANS WHO ARE TIRED OF SO MUCH VIOLENCE TO COME
TO THE POLLS IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS AND VOTE FOR PEACE AND PLURALISM.
I INVITE ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO JOIN IN SOLIDARITY WITH
THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE THREATENED
BY VIOLENCE.  IT IS TIME FOR GOOD SENSE AND PRUDENCE.  IT IS TIME TO
RISE TO THE OCCASION AND SHOW OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY.

   THIS IS THE TEXT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S MESSAGE ON THE
MURDER MR. CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ.

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] GUERRILLA GROUPS HAVE
REPORTED 185 SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES CASUALTIES DURING CLASHES WHICH
OCCURRED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS IN SIX OF THE COUNTRY'S 14 DEPARTMENTS,
BUT THE ARMY CLAIMS THAT IT ONLY SUSTAINED 48 CASUALTIES IN THOSE
CLASHES.

   ACCORDING TO RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI, A RADIO STATION OF THE
GUERRILLA GROUP, THE CASUALTIES WERE SUSTAINED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN
CLASHES WHICH OCCURRED ON 1 AND 2 MAY AND EARLY THIS MORNING WHEN
SEVERAL AMBUSHES, ATTACKS, AND SABOTAGE AIMED AT THE ECONOMY WERE
CARRIED OUT IN SEVERAL PLACES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI HAS REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY ACTIONS, THE
LARGEST SINCE THE REBEL OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER 1989, WHICH RESULTED IN
THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES, IS PART OF THE "WITH THE WORKERS AND FOR
DEMOCRACY" MILITARY CAMPAIGN.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN], WHICH DOES
NOT GIVE DETAILS ON ITS CASUALTIES, HAS SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES
SUSTAINED 30 CASUALTIES IN ILOBASCO, CABANAS DEPARTMENT, LOCATED
APPROXIMATELY 55 KM FROM SAN SALVADOR.

   NEVERTHELESS, ACCORDING TO MILITARY REPORTS ISSUED EIGHT HOURS
AFTER THE CLASHES IN THAT TOWN, THE ARMED FORCES KILLED 11 GUERRILLA
MEMBERS AND SUSTAINED SIX CASUALTIES.

   RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI HAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILA FORCES
CAUSED 28 ARMY CASUALTIES IN CLASHES ON 2 MAY IN LA LAGUNA,
CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 90 KM NORTH OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) ADMITTED THAT THE
GOVERNMENT TROOPS SUSTAINED 11 CASUALTIES IN THESE CLASHES, ADDING
THAT THEY INFLICTED THREE CASUALTIES ON THE REBELS.  COPREFA ALSO
REPORTED THAT 26 HOUSES WERE DAMAGED.

   COPREFA ALSO REPORTS THAT MILITARY ACTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN
CABANAS, LA LIBERTAD, CHALATENANGO, SANTA ANA, LA LIBERTAD, AND SAN
SALVADOR DEPARTMENTS DURING THE PAST TWO DAYS.  IN SOME PLACES THE
ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS WERE SABOTAGED, CAUSING LONG BLACKOUTS.

   THE GUERRILLA FORCES' GENERAL COMMAND ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE IN SAN
SALVADOR ON 2 MAY, STATING THAT THE MILITARY ACTIONS ARE IN RESPONSE
TO "THE TRIUMPHANT AND ARROGANT ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
MILITARY, FOR THE FMLN'S ALLEGED WEAKNESS, WHICH PRECLUDES THE
NEGOTIATION PROCESS."

   THE COMMUNIQUE REASSERTS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE THE
NEGOTIATION PROCESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO END A WAR WHICH HAS LASTED
MORE THAN A DECADE.  THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS IS BEING UNDERTAKEN WITH
THE MEDIATION OF UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR.

   PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S SPECIAL ENVOY, ALVARO DE SOTO, ARRIVED IN SAN
SALVADOR ON 2 MAY AS PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS.  HE MET WITH PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE COMMISSION TODAY, AND
LATER HE WILL MEET WITH OTHER LEADERS.

   GUILLERMO UNGO, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR), TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT OPPOSITION LEADERS
COULD "POSSIBLY" MEET WITH FMLN DELEGATES IN MEXICO CITY TO LEARN
THEIR VIEWS CONCERNING THE NEGOTIATIONS.

   "THE MEETING WILL HAVE AN OPEN AGENDA SO THAT EVERYONE'S POSITION
CAN BE HEARD AND SO THAT THE ROLE OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE DETERMINED," UNGO SAID.  


TST3-MUC4-0098

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [REPORT] [JULIO
ERNESTO RODRIGUEZ] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI
STATED TODAY THAT IT WOULD BE NO PROBLEM FOR THE FOURTH PENAL JUDGE,
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE CASE OF THE JESUITS MURDERED BY A GROUP OF
SOLDIERS, TO ORDER THAT CADETS WHO ARE TAKING COURSES ABROAD RETURN TO
THE COUNTRY.  IT WAS RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SEVERAL OFFICERS WHO
TESTIFIED DURING THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOW ATTENDING TRAINING
COURSES ABROAD.  IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY SCHOOL'S
REGISTRATION BOOK FOR PERSONS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE PREMISES HAD
BEEN LOST, INCLUDING THE PAGES THAT CORRESPOND TO NOVEMBER 1989.
TODAY, CRISTIANI TALKED ABOUT THIS MATTER AND SAID THE JUDGE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE AND NOT JUST MAKE STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE
PROBLEMS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY PROBLEM
IN THE OFFICERS RETURNING TO THE COUNTRY IF A JUDGE ORDERS THAT THEY
COME TO TESTIFY.  ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IS FOR THE JUDGE TO SUMMON
THEM; THEY WOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE COUNTRY TO TESTIFY AND, AFTER THAT,
RETURNED TO THEIR TRAINING COURSES.  GROUPS OF SOLDIERS ARE FREQUENTLY
SENT ABROAD TO TAKE TRAINING COURSES TO MAKE THEM MORE PROFESSIONAL;
THIS APPLIES NOT ONLY TO PERSONNEL FROM THE MILITARY SCHOOL, BUT FROM
ALL ARMED FORCES UNITS.

   CONCERNING THE OTHER MATTER, THE JUDGE HAS TO INVESTIGATE IT.  I
BELIEVE THAT INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING THERE, THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUE
TO SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE.  TELL ME, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY ARE
BROUGHT BACK FROM SUCHITOTO OR FROM THE UNITED STATES IF THEY MUST
TESTIFY BEFORE THE JUDGE?  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.  [END
RECORDING]

   THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TODAY AT THE EL SALVADOR MILITARY AIRPORT
BEFORE HE LEFT FOR COSTA RICA TO ATTEND THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY OF
PRESIDENT-ELECT RAFAEL CALDERON FOURNIER.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE
UNITED STATES CONDITIONING 50 PERCENT OF THE AID GIVEN TO OUR COUNTRY
COULD CAUSE THE REBEL FRONT TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIONS.  HE ACCUSED THE
FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] OF USING DIALOGUE FOR
TACTICAL REASONS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE HAVE STATED THAT AN ACTION OF THIS
TYPE WOULD BE VERY UNTIMELY, AS IT COULD MAKE THE MOST RADICAL FMLN
MEMBERS DECIDE TO CONTINUE THE WAR AND, THUS, HINDER THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS.

   [REPORTER] HOWEVER, [WORDS INDISTINCT] PRESSURE GOVERNMENT FOR THEM
[WORDS INDISTINCT] WITH FMLN.

   [CRISTIANI] I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION: WHO HAS ALWAYS SHOWED
GOODWILL AND SINCERELY SOUGHT AN AGREEMENT AND WHO HAS NOT DONE THIS?
HISTORY SHOWS THAT IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS USED THE PROPOSALS BY
[JOSE NAPOLEON] DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT AND MY OWN FOR TACTICAL REASONS.
IT HAS NOT BEEN THE GOVERNMENTS.  I BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN MUST
UNDERSTAND AND BE PRESSURED TO REALLY SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION.
[END RECORDING]

   ALSO TODAY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AUTHORIZED A SPOKESMAN TO
ANNOUNCE THAT TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN WILL BE RENEWED ON
16 MAY.  THE PANORAMA THAT SURROUNDS THIS NEW ENCOUNTER, HOWEVER,
PRESENTS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PATTERN FROM MEETINGS IN THE PAST,
BECAUSE BOTH SECTORS HAVE MET WITH POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED AT
THE [WORD INDISTINCT].  FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT
DONE THE SAME WITH THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL FORCES, THE REBELS WILL TRY TO
DO SO THIS WEEK.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THE RESULTS THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROM
THE DIALOGUE COULD BE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE OBTAINED DURING
PAST NEGOTIATIONS, BECAUSE ALMOST ALL THE SECTORS THAT HAVE BECOME
INVOLVED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE NEGOTIATING DEMAND THAT THE
AGREEMENTS ATTAINED BE BASED ON INTERNAL COOPERATION.  


TST3-MUC4-0099

   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 6 JUN 90 (NOTIMEX) -- [TEXT] CAUHTEMOC CARDENAS,
NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR THE PARTY OF THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION (PRD), SAID
DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE ON 7 JUNE THAT THE VISIT TO MEXICO BY SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI IS A VISIT BY "A REPRESSIVE RULER WHO OPPRESSES
A LARGE SECTOR OF HIS PEOPLE."

   AT THE SAME NEWS CONFERENCE, PRD SENATOR PORFIIRO MUNOZ LEDO SAID
THAT, AS A SIGN OF PROTEST, HIS PARTY WILL NOT ATTEND THE 8 JUNE
CONGRESSIONAL SESSION, WHICH WILL BE ATTENDED BY CRISTIANI. MUNOZ, WHO
IS DEPUTY FOR THE FEDERAL DISTRICT, SAID THAT "CRISTIANI IS THE HEAD
OF A REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT THAT IS GUILTY OF FLAGRANT HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS."

   HE SAID THAT "THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT CRISTIANI WAS INVOLVED IN THE
MURDER OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS" WHICH OCCURRED ON 16 NOVEMBER IN SAN
SALVADOR.  HE ALSO REFERRED TO THE "ILLEGAL" ARREST ON 31 MAY OF
MEXICAN PROFESSOR MARIA EUGNEIA OCHOA GARCIA, WHOM THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT ACCUSED OF HAVING CONNECTIONS WITH THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS.  SHE WAS RELEASED ON 7 JUNE.
