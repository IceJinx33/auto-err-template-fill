The MUC directory contains (in addition to the file you are currently
reading) materials from the 3rd and 4th Message Understanding
Conferences (MUC-3, MUC-4).  The specific contents of the
subdirectories are listed in the file named MUC-dir-file-listing.

These materials were placed on the ftp site by Beth Sundheim, NRaD
D44208.  The need for these materials will expire when the DARPA
Tipster Text program (which funds the Message Understanding
Conferences) has ended.  The current phase of that program ends in
October 1999.
