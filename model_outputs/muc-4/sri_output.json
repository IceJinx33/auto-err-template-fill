( reporter ) ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) commander , when do you expect the fm ##ln to join the process ? ( hand ##al ) look , deadline ##s are not the most important thing right now . what is important now is comply ##ing with the agreements to reach political agreements . that is the main aspect of the geneva agreement . it is possible that some deadline ##s will not be met . if deadline ##s are set and the time for implementing them ex ##pire ##s , then this is tan ##tam ##ount to wasting time . this then leads to steps being demanded that in reality depend on the political agreements that are reached and not the deadline ##s for reaching them . therefore , according to the agenda and the timetable agreed to here in caracas , the accent is on the political agreements . those agreements have to do with changes within the armed forces . everything related to the armed forces must be changed . every factor concerning the armed forces must be reviewed from a certain point or perspective . changes are necessary ; changes must be made and those changes must be significant . these changes must completely transform the armed forces , beginning with its role and influence in determining the country ' s policies and guidelines . we have been presenting proposals in this regard for some time . the topic of democrat ##ization is closely linked to the topic of the armed forces , to its pu ##rg ##ing , its reduction , and in sum , its end . we believe that the country will not always need the armed forces . as with any institution or historical factor , it emerges , it is maintained for a certain time , and then it tends to disappear . the country must have the opportunity to develop . it cannot continue along the same path because this would only represent expenses and a heavy burden for the country . for several decades , the armed forces have meant absence of liberty , real security , and the imp ##oss ##ibility of the civilian society to decide the country ' s path . elections have been turned into a mere formal ##ity , where those who were not elected run the country . the country is now going through a drama that has also shocked the international public , the murder of the jesuit priests . everyone is awaiting the results of the investigations and hoping that those who were responsible for this crime will be punished . we believe that the case of jesuit priests is really grave ; it is a drama that reflects the drama of the salvador ##an people ' s history in the current century .

these are a true ##r and more accurate reflection of a firm ' s income . \" cr ##ist ##iani says that the country ' s monetary policy must be aimed at increasing savings to promote domestic economic development . he says that it is necessary to make interest received on savings accounts in the country ' s banks more attractive so that capital does not leave the country . regarding the country ' s currency , cr ##ist ##iani says : \" we feel that currency value should be based on the availability of and demand for foreign exchange . we do not think it is appropriate for the government to ar ##bit ##rar ##ily dev ##al ##ue and fix an exchange rate on the salvador ##an colon . everything must be based on the foreign exchange our country may have to pay out for imports , because if we were to fix the rate at 10 ( colon ##es ) to 1 ( dollar ) , the central banks still would not have enough foreign exchange to cover all the import ##ers ' demands . \" further details as available .",

( az ##cona ) i believe that at this summit the central ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) . ( reporter ) how , mr president ? ( az ##cona ) well , i do not know . it is not easy to solve this problem . none of the problems will be easy to solve . ( reporter ) is there a possibility for dialogue ? ( az ##cona ) yes , but the nicaragua ##n government would also have to hold a dialogue with the nicaragua ##n resistance . ( reporter ) i am the vo ##z de nicaragua reporter . what is your opinion of the agreement reached by the nicaragua ##n government with the political parties ? ( az ##cona ) well , i read the agreement last night and believe it to be a step forward . incident ##ally , i read it twice last night and it is a very long document . i am talking about the agreement with the parties that are truly opposition parties and not the one made with the other parties because these are not really opposition parties . ( reporter ) what i wanted was your opinion on the demo ##bil ##ization of the contra ##s from honduras . ( az ##cona ) oh , you are talking about the small document that makes demands , demands , and more demands . this document has no value . ( reporter ) i mean the document signed with the 21 political parties . . . ( az ##cona , interrupting ) that agreement is valuable but it does not mention the contra demo ##bil ##ization . the document states that the nicaragua ##n government and the opposition parties agree that the esq ##ui ##pu ##las ii and costa del sol agreements should be ab ##ided by . this is the document i read twice , and i believe it is quite serious and a step forward . ( reporter ) what will you do to get the mercenaries to leave your country ? ( az ##cona ) first , i do not use der ##oga ##tory terms . they are nicaragua ##ns who for different reasons disagree with the system in nicaragua . these nicaragua ##ns oppose the system , and for this and other reasons they have taken up arms against the system and have taken refuge in honduras . i do not use the term mercenary . i understand the nicaragua ##n government uses it and it is all right for them to do so , but i will not answer a question that uses a term that i believe is too der ##oga ##tory . ( reporter ) the demo ##bil ##ization plan has a very firm deadline and is to be completed within 90 days . do you think . . . ( az ##cona , interrupting ) no , no . the 90 - day deadline is included in an agreement signed by nicaragua ##n president ortega with three small nicaragua ##n leftist parties . i do not believe this document is very important . i do believe , however , that the agreement signed by the nicaragua ##n president and the opposition parties is important because it is based on the esq ##ui ##pu ##las ii and costa del sol agreements . ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) terrorists in el salvador and contra ##s are presently not active , so both situations - - contra ##s and guerrillas - - are different . ( reporter ) is it true that president cr ##ist ##iani is going to present a parallel program at the summit ? ( az ##cona ) ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) president cr ##ist ##iani comes to the summit as el salvador ' s legitimate president . he has the right to present his points of view . he has the right to contribute to the solution of problems in other countries as well as to ones in his own country . ( reporter ) is there a possibility that a demo ##bil ##ization plan for the salvador ##an guerrillas will be studied at this summit if president cristina ##i presents one ? ( az ##cona ) of course . he has a right to do so . ( continued )",

( rep ##hra ##ses ) as has been pointed out by latin americans themselves and their most prominent figures , the final solution to the dramatic drug trafficking problem must be based on putting an end to the consumption of drugs . that is the main stumbling block in the fight against drug trafficking . the united states is the main consumption center of drugs in the world , and u . s . policy on drug trafficking is not consistent with the need to put an end and actively rep ##ress the consumption of drugs . u . s . policy , and all this is very well known in latin america , is based on destroying the plantations of a native plant in the continent , which is coca . presidents , political and social figures of the continent have said that the solution is not based on the destruction of a native plant but in active fight against drug consumption . i think that the statements made by the president of venezuela and the dramatic situation that colombia is facing these days confirm that the policy for fighting drug trafficking must be ten ##acious , strong , without hesitation and compassion . it must also be based on ending drug consumption by the united states - - the main drug consumer of the world - - which lives precisely from drug consumption and its business .",

        "doctext": "the most pressing demands of the chilean people have been brought up in the electoral campaign . one of the most important achievements of this campaign has been the combining of the campaign with the just economic , political , and social demands that the democratic forces and the popular movement have been making for these 16 years of dictatorship . these demands are related to the struggle against repression , the defense of human rights , the den ##unciation of crimes committed by the regime , and efforts to fight immunity and the suppression of the truth regarding torture , disappearance ##s , and assassination ##s . these questions have once again come into the spotlight now that many right ##ist candidates are dem ##ago ##gical ##ly attempting to pose as defenders of human rights and since el mer ##cu ##rio has reported that the dictator is planning to convert the cn ##i ( national information center ) into an agency of the army so that the main rep ##ress ##ive body from all these years can be under his direct control . jaime in ##zu ##nza , leader of the united left and the communist party of chile , discusses these topics over a direct phone line from santiago , chile . ( begin recording ) ( announcer ) how are the chilean people ' s demands connected to the ongoing electoral campaign ? ( in ##zu ##nza ) they are connected through the democrat ##ization of the neighborhood boards during the electoral process ; the strengthening of the unified actions of workers ; the development of the committees for victory , which will also be committees for the defense of victory and committees for carrying on the democratic task ; the development of confidence ; the struggle for human rights , particularly concerning truth and justice and immunity for crimes ; the increasing pressure by the immense majority of the population for the release of all political prisoners ; and naturally for the dissolution of the cn ##i . all of these questions are being brought up in the electoral campaign , and agreements have been reached within social organizations . this was evidenced a week ago by the salvador ##a strike and by the current strike by coal miners . this proves that the people have understood that the electoral campaign has to be an expression of their activities and a way to strengthen their social organizations for the future struggle . ( end recording ) the preceding comments were made by communist party of chile leader jaime in ##zu ##nza , who has been interviewed over the telephone on our program \" es ##cu ##cha chile . \" another topic discussed by in ##zu ##nza was the el mer ##cu ##rio report on the cn ##i ' s transfer to the army . the dissolution of the cn ##i has become one of the most pressing demands of the immense majority of chilean ##s . ( begin recording ) ( announcer ) what is your opinion , jaime in ##zu ##nza , on the dictator ' s intention to maintain the cn ##i as it is and to keep it under his direct command ? ( in ##zu ##nza ) i believe that this issue is particularly serious . the intention is to maintain intact the main terrorist apparatus of the dictatorship , which has been responsible for the most flag ##rant violations of human rights throughout the years of its existence . i understand that the dina ( national intelligence directorate , replaced by cn ##i ) and the cn ##i have been in fact a single apparatus and therefore the main organs of state terror ##ris ##m over the past 15 years . if transferred to the army , the cn ##i would continue to be under pin ##oche ##t ' s orders . under whose orders has it been all these years ? for whom has it been a direct agent all these years ? hence ##forth it will be under the control of the office of the commander in chief of the army . ( end recording ) communist leader jaime in ##zu ##nza added that pin ##oche ##t ' s intent in transferring the cn ##i to the army ' s direct command is to make the institution an acc ##omp ##lice in conceal ##ing people who have been responsible for crimes and human rights violations . ( begin recording ) ( in ##zu ##nza ) the idea is to involve the military institution in crimes for which the chilean people knows it was not responsible . this is clear : what the democratic opposition forces want is to have the cu ##lp ##rit ##s behind those crimes and human rights violations prosecuted , not the military institution . the transfer of the cn ##i to the army is an attempt to make the men in uniform act as acc ##omp ##lices or accessories to those crimes . loyalty is not at stake here ; loyalty is defending values and principles , not some sort of criminal com ##plicity that is not in line with the training of these men . this seems to me to be particularly serious because this transfer implies maintaining the cn ##i under the orders of the man responsible for the crimes committed all these years , the dictator himself . ( end recording ) these have been answers given by jaime in ##zu ##nza , united left and communist party of chile leader , to questions put to him over the phone by \" es ##cu ##cha chile , \" a radio moscow international program .",

( changes thought ) by the way , in recent days the salvador ##an armed forces have begun a number of searches in some houses where it is believed that some of these weapons were located . we have already found large amounts of weapons . in addition , the fm ##ln launched an aggression and hid behind you , salvador ##an people . it used you as a shield , wanting to convey the idea that they have the support of the salvador ##an people and that the people here would rise up to support them . they have realized that this view is totally false . far from supporting the fm ##ln , the salvador ##an people , salvador ##an brothers , supported the armed forces in the tremendous effort it has conducted to rep ##el the fm ##ln aggression . however , we must now consider a very important matter . it is impossible to carry out an aggression of this size without support from someone abroad . on this occasion , we are certain that this support came from nicaragua ##n president ortega and cuban president castro , but chiefly from ortega who is trying to raise a smoke ##screen in the face of the real possibility that mrs violet ##ta cha ##mo ##rro may defeat him in the elections , and because the fm ##ln has always been the puppet of the international communist aggression in which ortega and castro participate . if this is not so , let us take a look at what has happened . during those times when you were suffering moments of anguish last week , you were able to see the large number of foreigners who were supporting the fm ##ln terrorists . we have also managed to collect evidence that the ortega government trained fm ##ln fighters in the use of certain kinds of weaponry , specifically the grenade launcher ##s . what happened ? in the past few weeks we began noticing what kind of weapons were being used . in the foil ##ed attack on the presidential house , a subsequent attack on the salvador ##an armed forces ' joint chiefs of staff , and lastly , an attack on the national guard garrison particular kinds of weapons were being used . as a result of the savage action by fm ##ln , two little girls were killed . moreover , let us recall and see the connection that exists with all the shipments that the salvador ##an armed forces have been stopping between nicaragua ##n and el salvador . one shipment was made prior to the visit we presidents made to costa rica . in that country , we denounced ortega for continuing to send weapons and supporting the fm ##ln in an open violation of the central american peace process . and what has happened lately ? on 25 november , salvador ##an people , two light airplanes coming from nicaragua were discovered . their flight course indicates that they came from nicaragua , especially the one where the weapons were found . as additional proof , we have a document showing that one light aircraft belongs to the set ##a transportation company located in nicaragua ' s augusto cesar sand ##ino airport . it was bringing sophisticated equipment for the fm ##ln . in that aircraft accident , four people were killed : the pilot who was wearing civilian clothes and three other people were wearing military uniforms ; i mean camouflage uniforms like the ones worn in many countries , and like the ones the salvador ##an armed force use . it is believed that two of those people died as a result of the accident . we also believe that another person killed himself because he had a weapon in his hand and a bullet wound in forehead . he killed himself because he saw himself implicated in this situation .

( gu ##eva ##ra ) how do the five presidents con ##ce ##ive the demo ##bil ##ization of the fm ##ln ? how does the salvador ##an government con ##ce ##ive this happening ? ( cr ##ist ##iani ) i believe there have been substantial changes in this presidential meeting as compared to previous meetings . to explain this better , marco antonio , we must say we will not fall into what has been used in the past , that is , the famous symmetry . on this occasion , we have been very clear and cat ##egorical when we said that we were not willing to continue contributing sacrifices and other things from the salvador ##an government in order to solve the nicaragua ##n problem exclusively . we demanded uniform ##ity , and any other country confronting the aggression of an irregular force - - any other country in central america - - also has the right to be treated in a uniform manner , as far as measures and criteria that may be adopted in the presidential meetings . that is why today for the first time you are seeing how the measures adopted for the nicaragua ##n resistance - - that had been granted most of the attention up to now - - are also being adopted for the fm ##ln . we cannot allow a country to claim it is the only target of an aggression by an irregular armed force supported from abroad . here in el salvador we now have greater evidence following this 11 november terrorist aggression that the fm ##ln is a movement that can survive only with support from abroad , and that it obey ##s and exists because of international movements . in the second place , it has demonstrated that it only has the capacity to generate terrorism , which has been mentioned in this document . we cannot continue just talking about demo ##bil ##ization and pacific ##ation in nicaragua . it is time to apply this to all irregular groups , be it the ur ##ng ( guatemala ##n national revolutionary unity ) in guatemala , or any other irregular armed group that may come up and may try to hind ##er the democratic process in the area . we see this as something that has gone deep into the minds of all the central american presidents , and from now on , we will have greater uniform ##ity in treating all of those irregular groups that operate in the region . ( moderator ) rene hurt ##ado of el mundo . ( hurt ##ado ) mr president , following the tel ##a and costa del sol meetings , nicaragua has changed its stand . in costa rica , president ortega was asked if he had sold out the fm ##ln in exchange for the demo ##bil ##ization of the contra ##s and other results of the summit in favor of nicaragua . i would like to know your opinion about this , and also how you interpret the fact that president ortega has accepted some issues about the fm ##ln that he did not allow in tel ##a or costa del sol ? on the other hand , will the demo ##bil ##ization of the fm ##ln be the result of a dialogue or negotiations later on ? ( cr ##ist ##iani ) in the first place , i believe that daniel ortega was unable to pull any more tricks out of his hat , and he was facing a fact he could no longer hide : he is the one who is spreading armed revolutions in central america and trying to ham ##per democratic processes in the region . once more he has been caught not honoring the commitments agreed on in tel ##a , but rather violating these commitments . on this occasion he has been left with no possible defense . therefore , in our opinion , he has no option other than to accept the reality of what is happening in central america , or see himself totally isolated amid a peace plan that has international support . this situation would cause him many problems and headache ##s in political and diplomatic matters .",

( begin recording ) ( ma ##za ) the das has evidence showing that this individual master ##mind ##ed two attacks including the the most recent and worst one in which more than 60 innocent people were killed . ( reporter ) how do you know that go ##nza ##lo rodriguez ga ##cha master ##mind ##ed the recent attack on das ? ( ma ##za ) because the investigations that we have conducted along with the national police ever since the attack occurred point in that direction . if we compare the mod ##us opera ##ndi of rodriguez and his people , we come to the conclusion that the period between the ( word ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) and the action itself are very similar . furthermore , this man was in there celebrating the genocide that he had committed in bogota . ( reporter ) ( question ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) ( ma ##za ) because the intelligence reports indicate this , and according to certain statements we have , he was over ##joy ##ed by the damage that he had caused in the city given the large number of people who were killed ; seeing him sun ##bat ##hing and swimming on the atlantic coast led us to believe this . ( reporter ) is this a police reaction to the drug traffic ##kers ' attack on das ? ( ma ##za ) no , i am not saying that it is a reaction . this is the result of very professional work on the part of the national police . that is what i told the president today . i brief ##ed him on the events which led to the action that has changed the situation which had prevailed in the country just a few hours ago .

        "doctext": "good evening . i have called this news conference to read a foreign ministry com ##mun ##ique : ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) today the panama ##nian government told luis sand ##iga cab ##rera , our charge d ' affair ##es in panama , that he must leave panama in 72 hours . 2 . we have expressed to the panama ##nian government , through the panama ##nian charge d ' affair ##es in lima , our surprise and strong protest over that decision . 3 . in view of this decision , the peruvian government has decided to reduce the personnel of its diplomatic mission in panama and to maintain its relations with that country at the first secretary level . peru will in this way continue to fulfill the humanitarian mission of protecting those who have sought asylum in its embassy in panama while the panama ##nian government issues the safe - conducts that we requested in accordance to the convention on diplomatic asylum signed in caracas on 28 march 1954 . peru is contact ##ing the members of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement ( group of eight ) to explain the situation and to ask for solidarity and cooperation in overcoming this momentary crisis . the delicate situation regarding the people at the peruvian embassy has provoked our justified alarm and imp ##elled us to begin talks to ensure that their diplomatic asylum will be respected . we have talked with the ambassadors from the countries of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement . i have personally spoken with the ambassadors of venezuela , mexico , and colombia . i am now ready to answer any questions : ( reporter ) mr la ##rco cox , unofficial sources have said that the people in the peruvian embassy in panama are not exactly political refugees but common criminals . what do you say about this ? ( la ##rco cox ) the country that grants asylum determines this . we have been very careful to review each one of them and their files . we have checked to see if any of them were facing any trials in panama or the united states . our investigation has revealed that none of them are facing any trials . the charges were made afterward . we see this as a result of the emotional climate presently existing in panama . ( reporter ) what is your personal opinion of the incident ? ( la ##rco cox ) it is the diplomatic way to express a protest over what they have been led to believe . according to panama ##nian reports , charge d ' affair ##es luis sand ##iga has made statements on the situation that did not please the government . the truth is that sand ##iga has not made any declaration ##s . however , former ambassador castro arenas is in panama and he has embarked on a campaign in which he is seeking retaliation against the peruvian government . he could not think of anything better than to point at sand ##iga as the person responsible for alleged statements . sand ##iga has not said a word about the situation because that is not his job . besides , his car and the car belonging to one of the embassy ' s military attache ##s have been stolen ; there is no way to begin an investigation . ( reporter ) are you saying that former ambassador castro arenas is directly responsible for the situation ? ( la ##rco cox ) you can make your own conclusions . ( reporter ) if the situation deter ##ior ##ates , will peru recall all of its personnel from panama ? ( la ##rco cox ) we cannot go to that extreme because we are fulfilling a humanitarian cause , as we said in the com ##mun ##ique . our first responsibility at this time is to see that the right of asylum is respected . as long as the refugees remain in the embassy , we will maintain our representation at the level of first secretary .

( begin recording ) ( cr ##ist ##iani ) i do not believe there is any problem in the officers returning to the country if a judge orders that they come to testify . all that is required is for the judge to summon them ; they would be brought to the country to testify and , after that , returned to their training courses . groups of soldiers are frequently sent abroad to take training courses to make them more professional ; this applies not only to personnel from the military school , but from all armed forces units . concerning the other matter , the judge has to investigate it . i believe that instead of just staying there , the judge should continue to search for evidence . tell me , what is the difference if they are brought back from such ##ito ##to or from the united states if they must testify before the judge ? there is no difference at all . ( end recording ) the president spoke today at the el salvador military airport before he left for costa rica to attend the inauguration ceremony of president - elect rafael calderon four ##nier . he also said that the united states conditioning 50 percent of the aid given to our country could cause the rebel front to increase their actions . he accused the fm ##ln ( far ##ab ##und ##o mart ##i national liberation front ) of using dialogue for tactical reasons . ( begin recording ) ( cr ##ist ##iani ) we have stated that an action of this type would be very un ##time ##ly , as it could make the most radical fm ##ln members decide to continue the war and , thus , hind ##er the dialogue process . ( reporter ) however , ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) pressure government for them ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) with fm ##ln . ( cr ##ist ##iani ) i would ask the question : who has always showed goodwill and sincerely sought an agreement and who has not done this ? history shows that in the past , the fm ##ln has used the proposals by ( jose napoleon ) du ##arte ' s government and my own for tactical reasons . it has not been the governments . i believe that the fm ##ln must understand and be pressured to really search for a political solution . ( end recording ) also today , the un secretary general authorized a spokesman to announce that talks between the government and fm ##ln will be renewed on 16 may . the panorama that surrounds this new encounter , however , presents an entirely different pattern from meetings in the past , because both sectors have met with political parties represented at the ( word ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) . furthermore , although the government has not done the same with the country ' s social forces , the rebels will try to do so this week . undoubtedly , the results that could be obtained from the dialogue could be much more important than those obtained during past negotiations , because almost all the sectors that have become involved , directly or indirectly , in the negotiating demand that the agreements attained be based on internal cooperation .",

( reporter ) violence has increased recently and the people are extremely worried . what are the armed forces doing to guarantee the people ' s welfare ? ( vi ##des ) the salvador ##an people ' s concern about increased terrorist violence is understand ##able . we must bear in mind that terrorist acts always es ##cala ##te when important events are expected . this does not happen only in our country ; we recently saw it in seoul , before the olympics , when groups resort ##ed to violence to provoke the authorities and prevent an international event from taking place . an o ##as meeting is scheduled to take place in this country in a few days . the event is being threatened by a number of acts , particularly terrorist acts in the san benito , max diaz , es ##cal ##on , and san francisco neighborhoods . the terrorists believe the people will protest against the o ##as meeting if they cause terror in those areas . we are expecting foreign ministers from latin america , central america , and the united states , whom the terrorists believe will call off the meeting because of the situation in the country . that is the main reason for the increased violence . you have seen that we have increased patrol operations recently . patrols are also being carried out around the volcanoes near san salvador . security measures are also being implemented on the periphery of san salvador and around the meeting venue , but i cannot give you the details . there is also a complete security plan for the officials who will participate in the o ##as meeting . we are ready to reduce the possibility of an incident to a minimum . however , i have always been honest and i must admit there is always the possibility of sabotage or a terrorist act . this does not necessarily mean that it will affect the security measures in the area of the meeting . for example , a blackout can be caused by cutting off an electric line in a distant area . ( reporter ) general , the fm ##ln ' s attacks have not been so overwhelming in the past , yet now those attacks are attaining considerable military success . do the fm ##ln ' s military actions mean it is superior to the armed forces ? ( vi ##des ) we cannot con ##ce ##ive their military superiority under any circumstances . i have noticed the guerrilla leaders are currently visiting different countries , particularly the con ##tad ##ora group members . they are trying to gain support for reading a statement at the o ##as meeting , and they are also trying to pressure the salvador ##an government into negotiating with them . this proves the rebels have failed mil ##ita ##rily , and that failure has been brought about by our large - scale operations in northern cha ##late ##nan ##go department and us ##ulu ##tan department , in the east of the country . the rebels have tried to bring the war to urban areas . however , the plans of sub ##vers ##ive groups - - i showed you the documents on their fire plan in another meeting - - did not include the type of terrorist acts that we have seen lately . instead , they planned a general uprising and strike before the elections . this proves , as i said , that the sub ##vers ##ives could not develop their fire plan . they have carried out several acts but they have failed to achieve the expected results . this is like having a cinema show a movie every day with no - one turning up to see it . the sub ##vers ##ives are trying to carry out this type of event right now to give the impression of military strength , so the o ##as will pass a resolution recommend ##ing negotiation to solve the conflict . furthermore , the rebels are trying to disc ##red ##it the democratic process and boycott our next elections because some people are demo ##ral ##ized by terrorism and lack the will to participate in politics , which makes the election results un ##sat ##is ##factory .

( villa ##gra ##n ) right now , the political and diplomatic commission , on directions from the ur ##ng general command , is making every effort to human ##ize the war situation in the country , especially by showing respect for the geneva agreement , which guatemala signed . we are doing this because the rep ##ress ##ive war the army has been wa ##ging against the revolutionary movement and the population has reached levels of extreme cruelty , including ind ##is ##cr ##imi ##nate bombings and the use of def ##oli ##ants in conflict zones where civilians live . there is the particular situation in which neither the guatemala ##n army nor the government take any war prisoners . this makes us believe that the cruelty used against civilians and people involved in the armed conflict is a violation of human rights . ( martinez ) does the ur ##ng have any prisoners at this moment ? ( villa ##gra ##n ) yes . we have sent a note to the national reconciliation commission so it can handle the case of soldier carlos perez lopez , who was captured wounded in the san marcos region , near gal ##vez . he has been given much medical attention . now that he has fully recovered , we are thinking about publicly returning this guatemala ##n , and we are asking the reconciliation commission to take measures through the international red cross ( ir ##c ) to receive this man in the framework of the human ##ization process . ( martinez ) will this be the first time the ur ##ng will make this kind of contact with the ir ##c ? ( villa ##gra ##n ) the ir ##c has had local ##ization problems . there has been the argument that there is a national red cross . contact with the ir ##c is possible if there is a presence of this organization that functions based on international agreements . now that the ir ##c is present , the work is being facilitated . the contact with the ir ##c is at the initiation level . however , i believe these contacts will be very useful in the future , especially for persons not involved in the armed conflict . ( martinez ) i think it would be useful if we close this interview with you repeating the name of the guatemala ##n army soldier who is being held by the ur ##ng and whom the guerrilla forces are prepared to turn over to the ir ##c .
